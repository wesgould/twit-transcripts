[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.240]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.720]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google and the cloud
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.800]   are cloudy but always clear.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.760]   Gina Trapani is here.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.480]   Hello.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.920]   From smartawear.org and the author of the complete guide
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.960]   to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.880]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.240]   Hi.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.320]   Great to be here today.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.800]   Good to see you.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.720]   You won't be bored today.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240]   We're not going to talk about the iPad.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.720]   [GASP]
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   Oh, a little bit.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.720]   A little bit.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.560]   But it'll be all negative.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.200]   So they'll make you feel good.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   Awesome.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.400]   I need some affirmation.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.880]   If we're going to have Jeff Jarvis's boxing video,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.840]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com, professor of journalism
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.000]   at the City University of New York,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   and former Claremont McKenna student.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.480]   Bye, yeah.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.400]   I'm going down to Scripps tomorrow to visit.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.520]   What's the latest?
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.280]   Well, we're waiting.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.160]   We got four schools.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.920]   Has Jake decided?
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.480]   We were Rochester yesterday.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.880]   And I think it's leading into Clubhouse Turn.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   Rochester, the city, didn't do itself any service.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.240]   It snowed.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.960]   Good.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.280]   You want him to know what he's in for.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.040]   One of the schools Abby's considering
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.920]   Bard is also upper New York state.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.040]   And unfortunately, it's going to be gorgeous weather
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.160]   when she goes.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.360]   But the good news is it's going to be like eight different flights
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.040]   she has to take to get there, because she has to fly to Albany.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.160]   What are you rooting for, Dad?
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.520]   I'm rooting for Scripps.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.840]   But don't tell Abby that, because she won't go if she knows.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.520]   But you know, I got an email from the IT director at Scripps.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.360]   And this is down in Claremont, California, down in LA County.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.760]   It's a five school consortium.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.120]   Scripps is one of the five Claremont five.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.520]   And he's a fan.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.680]   He's a listener.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.560]   And he says, you know, we have Gigabit to the pillow.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.240]   I said, what?
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.160]   They have wired up all these students
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.520]   at Scripps for Gigabit Ethernet in their dorm room.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.920]   That's it.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.760]   That's fantastic.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.760]   If it were me--
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.920]   I was making a sense of change operation to go there,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.520]   but I'll do it.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.960]   If it were me, I'd be like, you're done.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.920]   But Abby goes, yeah, so what?
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   OK, what else they got?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.840]   It's her-- you know what?
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240]   She's going to have to be there for four years.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.280]   I write the checks, but she's going to have to be there for four years.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.760]   So I guess she should choose.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840]   So we got a lot of stories to talk about, Jeff and Gina.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.120]   It's just the three of us.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.800]   We made some room for Howard Stern's IT guy.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.240]   He couldn't do it because he's coaching soccer, likely excuse, Jeff
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.760]   Shek.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.360]   But I'm going to visit him on April 26th to get the full tour
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.080]   of what happens.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.240]   And this week, in fact, I called him Mr. and Show twice.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.960]   Howard was going on again about us making fun of him for his OS.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.200]   He never just says something once, does he?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   He's got to--
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.440]   Oh, he recycles.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.480]   Beat it dead horse.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.040]   And so I called back in.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.680]   We had a discussion about the iPad, by the way.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.760]   And he said that he didn't see any use for it.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   And that went on.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.360]   And the next day, Jeff Shek, the IBM guy for Lotus Notes,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.000]   had to come into the studio, I think,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.520]   sent by his corporate betters because he
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.240]   had a defend Lotus Notes against me.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.480]   So of course, I called in again and laughed at him.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.200]   And so we're getting together on the 26th.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.280]   And I'll see his fuel view.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.720]   And I think we'll get him on the show.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.440]   Good.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   I wonder if he gets gigabit to the schnaz.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.920]   If he doesn't, he's not a good IT guy.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.840]   So Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, you've posted a video,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.720]   or you will soon.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.560]   It's not up as we speak, but soon we'll--
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.280]   It's up on YouTube, not my blog yet.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.080]   I saved it for you, Leo and Jita.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.040]   So go to at buzzmachine.com to see Jeff's boxing video.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   What the--
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   What the--
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.960]   You're reboxing.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.880]   You're sending-- you're not unboxing.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   You're sending--
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.800]   You're sending back the iPod.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.680]   --reboxing--
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.400]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.720]   --taking my iPad back to the store.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.120]   It's not really out of dogma, though I do share some
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.680]   of Corey Dr. Rose's fears about the closed world
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.840]   that Steve Jobs is creating, nor is it
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.360]   another product's limitations that I've
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.920]   complained about in my blog.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.160]   It's going to get multitasking and other things.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.840]   It's really just because I don't see a need for it.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.400]   It's solving a problem that I don't think exists.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.960]   He says, by the way, sitting in front of a desktop and a
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.080]   laptop computer--
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.760]   Actually, just a screen on my laptop.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.800]   Oh, that's the laptop.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680]   And then, of course, you have in your pocket that I don't
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.120]   know what the Nexus 1.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.640]   All right.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I have my iPhone.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   And my iPhone.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   And I have my iPhone.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.240]   Yeah, you're probably-- you're a device rich.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.000]   You probably don't.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.520]   Oh, I am.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.960]   I am.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.040]   You probably don't need anything more.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.760]   This is disconcerting.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   My wife says.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.280]   To dissolve from Jeff to Jeff is very odd.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.120]   Me.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.920]   I don't know which.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   I said, watch.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.960]   So do you actually box it up in this video?
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.480]   Oh, well, I've got a bigger, better TV right across there.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.000]   Why watch it here?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.400]   Is it laptop junior?
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.000]   Well, no, without that USB port, especially, I can't do
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.120]   work on it.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.840]   Is it my iPhone on stereo?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.960]   By the way, Jeff's wearing exactly the same outfit.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.880]   So that's what's really scary.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.840]   No, I just don't see this.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.000]   You could lip sync this, Jeff.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.480]   Just move your lips in.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   So I'm taking it back.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   Wow.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.720]   Here's the reboxing.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   I just love this.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.440]   I love the look.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.720]   I love the look back at the camera.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.320]   If you play this backwards, it would look like an unboxing.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.600]   Except I'd be more excited.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.280]   Not gross.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.440]   This is my favorite part.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   I can wear those, of course.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.920]   That's cleaning the screen.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.720]   So there it is.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.880]   My iPad is reboxed and ready to go back.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.000]   I'll pay a $50 restock to the--
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.520]   Ooh.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.020]   --heate.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.160]   I'll consider that my early adopters tax.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.680]   That's great, Jeff.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   It's taking a stand.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.920]   The Apple fanboys are already attacking me on Twitter
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.640]   and YouTube or even Twitter.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.960]   People take this stuff so seriously.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.360]   I think you're crazy.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.600]   But it's your craziness.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.320]   I don't have--
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.720]   Well, I mean, I heard my feelings.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.680]   I'm like, I'm best now.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.680]   The day could happen that there are some magnificent apps
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.280]   that come out that make me have to buy it back again.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.680]   And I'll do it and I'll admit it and be open about it.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.280]   But right now, I just--
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.120]   I don't see a use.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.160]   I'm just trying to make Gina feel good.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.640]   Yeah, you guys, go ahead.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.720]   That's fine.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah, no, I'm with Jeff, though.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.360]   If there are some killer, crazy iPad apps
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.160]   that are just-- I can't live without.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.880]   I'll buy one.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   Sure.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.520]   I mean, it's less about politics.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   I'm not necessarily waiting for the Android pad.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   Although that might-- that may be the case.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.520]   I just can't tell.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.840]   Actually, at first, I thought Android would not
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.200]   work very well with this.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.840]   And the more I think about it, I think
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.920]   an Android version of this would be pretty compelling.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.240]   Well, I'm going to get my hands on the Wepad in Germany
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   next week.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.200]   And that's Android-based?
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.600]   That's Android-based, two USBs, camera, and similar size.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   I think six hours battery versus 10 hours batteries,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.760]   what they say.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.360]   They're announcing it formally on the 12th.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.040]   And I'll have goodbye speech in Berlin on the 13th.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.160]   And I hope to have one of my hands.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.660]   Good.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.800]   I'd love to hear what you think.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.880]   I have a feeling we're going to have the same thing happen
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   that happened with the iPhone, which is three years of iPad
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.400]   killers that are death-warmed over.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.280]   But we'll see.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.360]   The Juju has been very disappointing to people.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.600]   I think there's a reason not to have a file system, a camera,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.880]   and a lot of complexity.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.560]   Personally, I've got one for my 80-year-old father-in-law.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.640]   I think I'm going to give this one to my wife when my 3G comes.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.400]   And she's a perfect example of somebody who has a notebook.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.920]   But when she minimized email and saw the desktop, she said,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.240]   what's that?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.480]   And what are all those little pictures on there?
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   I said, honey, those are icons of files you've saved
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.200]   to the desktop.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.040]   What's the desktop?
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.960]   She didn't know and didn't need to know.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.600]   She didn't need a file system.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.360]   She just wanted the data to be there.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.800]   I tried to get my wife to use the iPad
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.040]   just so I could have an excuse to keep it.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.600]   And she would go nowhere near it.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.200]   You can't rebox something you're keeping, so that's good.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.000]   We wouldn't have had a reboxing.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.880]   Doesn't iPhone 4.0 involve folders and desktop wallpapers
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.400]   and that kind of thing?
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:52.880]   It does.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   It does.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.920]   And I think it means that Google
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.520]   pushed them in a few ways, which was useful for the marketplace.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.720]   It pushed them to multitasking of a sort,
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.320]   though it's a weird kind of multitasking,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.320]   and pushed them to folders and organizations, small things.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.480]   But I think competition is a god bless America.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.040]   Wonderful thing.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.080]   It's very clear that almost all of what Apple did it--
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   at least the seven tent poles Steve Jobs talked about in iPhone
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.560]   4.0.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.760]   All of them were in response to either Google or Amazon.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:25.080]   They're doing this iAd, which is basically AdMob's, right?
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.240]   They're going to do their own ad network.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.720]   They're going to do multitasking.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.280]   I'm not convinced that either multitasking or folders
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.920]   are a good idea.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.480]   I think there is a lot to be said for a very simple platform
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.920]   in terms of views of use.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.760]   And I think one of the problems Microsoft's
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   had with its phones is that it's Windows or tablets,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.080]   that they're Windows.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.320]   And you can't shrink down a desktop operating system
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.720]   and expect it to work well.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.440]   So we'll see.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:51.920]   We'll see.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.480]   Time will tell.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:59.440]   In the words of the bad local TV news reporter, only time
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.000]   will tell.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.920]   What is the other big-- I'm looking through all of our stories
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.040]   here.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.520]   We've got a ton of them.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.200]   Now, it's been huge this week, I would say,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.320]   but lots of little stuff.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   Most of the news is--
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.360]   I think Apple and ads is worth another second.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.040]   Let's talk about that.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.600]   I've tried two shows now to get a conversation going up this,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.040]   and I've failed each time.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.360]   Try one more time.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   Third time's a charm.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.800]   The shift from a browser-based web-based architecture
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.280]   of the net to an app-based architecture of the net.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.800]   I still have concerns about it.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.040]   I think that it closes things in.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.840]   And content companies think they're
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.480]   an application when they're not, but they're closing things in.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.880]   And it cuts off search and discovery through search
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.120]   and discovery other ways.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.080]   To get access to whatever is in this app,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.640]   you've got to download and install an app.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.480]   And that just, I think, bulkitizes the web.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.160]   Well, Apple's doing the same thing
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.040]   to an extent with I-ads, because the ads will appear
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.000]   inside the apps.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.320]   You will not click out.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.240]   There'll be app-like experiences in the apps.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.560]   And that's probably a good thing for the advertising.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.120]   But the bigger thing that's happening here
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.920]   is-- I should have seen this before.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.160]   All of the people should have seen this before.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.960]   But it really is a frontal attack on Google
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.040]   with the control freak and the control
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.280]   addicts of jobs and media and advertising all in line.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.400]   They don't want to be discovered by search.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.880]   They wish they weren't discovered by search.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.680]   They don't know what to do with people who come through search.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.400]   And so they still think in a brand-centered world
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.440]   where you come to them and install their thing,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.080]   buy their thing, stay in their world.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.360]   And that's what this is.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.760]   And maybe it is a big attack on Google.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.520]   Maybe Google could lose a lot here.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   I don't know.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'm not sure it's such a global thing.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.240]   I mean, I think Apple wants to support developers.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.680]   Developers say to Apple, we want to do free apps.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.280]   But in order for us to do free apps,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.880]   we want to be able to play ads in the apps.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.440]   Apple doesn't want to leave that money on the table.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.880]   AdMob's, the company Google bought,
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.680]   really was created to put ads in iPhone apps.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.800]   So Apple's just saying, well, why should we let Google
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.960]   have that revenue?
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.240]   Why don't we create it?
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.160]   And here's where Apple has the upper hand.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.440]   They've got the ecosystem for app developers for distribution.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.480]   If you add the third part, I add in,
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.880]   I think most developers just because they, well, it all
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.560]   goes together.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.240]   And it's a push of a button.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.000]   Why not?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.840]   They also, by the way, announced a competitive Xbox
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.520]   Live or PlayStation Live, a gaming social gaming community.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.600]   And I think it's the same thing.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.280]   It's not so much they want to disable these other companies.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.320]   It's just they don't want to leave the money on the table.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.640]   Same reason Twitter bought Tweety.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.880]   Actually, that, to me, is more of an example
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.280]   of what you were talking about, Jeff.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.600]   Because they're not going to charge for--
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.840]   - The only lower end of the door from Seismic
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   was growling in Twitter, or probably not to growl.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.560]   - Well, Fred Davis--
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.400]   - This is for the developers.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.800]   - Kind of warned everybody a week ago,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.440]   Fred Davis, the venture capitalist, one of the early--
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:12:59.960]   - Fred Wilson.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.840]   - Wilson, I'm sorry.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.960]   Fred Davis, an old friend of mine.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.800]   Fred Wilson.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.880]   - A-B-C dot com, yeah.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.920]   - Yeah.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   An early investor in Twitter warned everybody.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.480]   He said, don't start making money building stuff
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.200]   that Twitter could build.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.320]   Obviously, he knew what was coming.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.760]   Because Twitter goes out and buys the, probably,
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.640]   the premier third party tweeting application.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.440]   And sends a signal to anybody who's making a third party
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.640]   business on Twitter that maybe this isn't a good idea.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.000]   - But, right.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.800]   I mean, the way Jake, young son, Jake, explained it to me
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.640]   was that basically people search for Twitter on iTunes.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.600]   They don't get Twitter.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.880]   - Yeah, I think that's what it's about.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.760]   - I get that.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.200]   - But I wasn't in a terrible signal to developers.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.600]   Gina, that, whereas Facebook to the opposite,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   Facebook killed its own applications--
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.520]   - Right.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.200]   - Like courses which Jake rewrote then,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.800]   and the belief developers would do a better job
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.280]   than to encourage development.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.960]   Now Twitter is doing precisely the opposite.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.440]   - You know, I don't have a problem with them buying Twitter.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.320]   I think it makes a lot of sense for them as a business
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.840]   that people would search for the word Twitter in the App Store
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.000]   and get an app from them.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   You know, I think the reality is that developers
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.600]   are gonna work on applications that do things
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.440]   that Twitter proper doesn't.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.960]   And I mean, sure, I mean, I think the expectation is that
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.520]   you build something that does something really cool.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.400]   The company's gonna use it.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.080]   So, Google, this week released nested labels in Gmail.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.320]   It was a Labs feature.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.680]   - Finally.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.120]   - Yeah, which is fantastic.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.680]   But you know, there's a user script
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.040]   where a grease monkey, user script developer,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.920]   a rend VR, I'll just gonna say VR
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.160]   'cause all massacre his last name, otherwise.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.560]   Who wrote this, this grease monkey,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.280]   user script folder for Gmail like two years ago.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.680]   And I've had it, excuse me, in my better Gmail,
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.520]   Firefox extension for like two years now.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.200]   And it's one of the best features.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.360]   So, Manu, I think that's how you pronounce his name,
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.240]   who's the Google engineer who wrote the post,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.640]   came to me last August and said,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.480]   "What do you think should be in Gmail Labs?"
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   And I said, "Well, obviously, folders for Gmail
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.400]   "should be in it."
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.280]   And now it is.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.240]   And so, I mean, you could take that as kind of an upfront
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.520]   to the developer, like, oh, you know, this, you know,
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.560]   Google just copied what this, you know, great developer did
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.000]   that, you know, that that user's found really useful.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.520]   I see it as like, first of all, it's an honor, I think,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.720]   for a rend 'cause, you know, what he wrote
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.240]   was valuable enough for them to use.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.480]   And I also see it as a challenge
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.200]   to make more innovative things as a third party developer.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.840]   I don't really have a problem with it.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.960]   - I think this is a little different though,
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   because for, well, for one thing, Twitter,
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.760]   you can totally ascribe all of Twitter's success
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.720]   because there are a lot of Twitter clones
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.320]   to its API and the very quick adoption
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.960]   from third party developers.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.800]   - Definitely.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.520]   - And the amazing variety that they created.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.600]   Some of these developers are making a Twitter client
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   so they charge for.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.520]   Twitter was $2.99.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.720]   If Twitter gives away one of the best clients for free,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.800]   don't you think that's kind of a little up yours
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.200]   to all of these third party developers
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.240]   who put Twitter on the map in the first place?
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.560]   - It raises the bar.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   It raises the bar.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.960]   Your app has to do something better than Tweety does.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.520]   - But Tweety's gonna have access to the APIs.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.240]   Well, this will be very interesting to watch.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.120]   You know, this is historically an issue
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.360]   with the operating systems.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.320]   If Microsoft, for instance, uses secret API calls
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.680]   that they don't document, they tell others not to use
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.320]   to give their software an edge,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.600]   that's really anti-competitive.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.520]   In fact, they can get in trouble for it.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.240]   It'd be very interesting to see if Twitter
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   gives Tweety access to information and data, right?
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.900]   - Precise.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.740]   - That other developers don't have.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.240]   - Twitter has a history of this, by the way.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.080]   Twitter's Firehose, which is the single most valuable thing
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.640]   Twitter has, which is all the updates.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.440]   It's very selective about who gets it.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.400]   And many people who've asked for it legitimately
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.040]   are not allowed to use it.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.840]   - I went to a conference called Four Square,
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.440]   not related to Four Square, where Four Square appeared.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.840]   A few months ago, it was run by a big quad wrangle,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.960]   a big equity company in New York.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.840]   And the investment guy was sitting there with Reed Hoffman
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.840]   of LinkedIn, Buzz, a bizstone of Twitter,
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.720]   and I think Chad Hurley.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.480]   And a several moment for me was when he asked them,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.680]   well, what company would you want to do
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.760]   a big distribution deal with?
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.160]   They looked at him like they were confused dogs.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.480]   Why would we do that?
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.160]   And they all said-- - I don't get it.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.880]   - Well, we have our people distribute us,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.680]   and Biz was eloquent about how Twitter has become Twitter
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   through its API and through the developers who've done it.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.520]   - That's obvious.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.400]   - And listen, they bought a search engine,
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.200]   they bought from Betaworks early on
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.520]   because it was a function they didn't have
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.200]   and they just truly absolutely needed.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.160]   And so in that sense, I agree with Gina,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.520]   I understand the need for the core company to have something.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.880]   But I do think that they could be hurting themselves
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.600]   with their key distributors, which is developers.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.560]   - Well, watch closely 'cause if they do anything else
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.720]   along those lines, then that may,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.120]   I mean, Fred kind of implied they might.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.560]   He based on why would you invest?
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.000]   So there are adventure funds to work on apps for Facebook
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.960]   and iPad and iPod, and as far as I know Twitter,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   what happens to the security of that investment?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.840]   I think the other question I want to ask Fred is,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.520]   okay, now if a company came to you making Twitter apps,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.560]   knowing what you know, would you ever invest in them?
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.600]   - Yeah.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.760]   Well, you're the developer, Gina.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.240]   I mean, it's really you that this comes down to.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.000]   If you were a developer of a third party tweet app,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.080]   say tweet deck or Loique, Seismic,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.000]   would you feel, would this discourage you
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.640]   from further development?
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.480]   - Initially, it would make me sad and feel discouraged,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.960]   initially, but if you think it through,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.400]   the fact is that if users who don't know the names,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.760]   Seismic and Tweet Deck and these casual users
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.440]   are able to find a Twitter app in the app store
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   and get onto Twitter using Tweety,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.560]   I mean, that just means more people are gonna use Twitter.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.280]   And it also, like I said, sets the bar.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.520]   Tweety's a great app.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.560]   Your app just has to do something a little better.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.760]   If it means that more people are gonna be using Twitter
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.480]   mobile-y and that they're gonna say,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.200]   this is great, but I wish that I had an app
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.240]   that did this other thing,
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   then that's what you have to shoot for.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.360]   And so yeah, initially I'd be discouraged,
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.120]   but really, I think it just makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.560]   It makes a lot of sense for Twitter as a business
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.480]   to offer to users.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.840]   Yeah, I'm just I aming with a Neil
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.440]   and he made a great point, which is like,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.040]   Twitter's audience is users, it's not developers.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.240]   And I think this is a good thing for users.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.160]   And I think that's a good thing for developers.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.800]   So I didn't-- - Yeah, but I didn't
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.720]   just talk more. - I think that's really,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.320]   that's really the important point.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.000]   And also not to go back to Apple,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.080]   but I've been trying to ask myself
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.760]   whether the decisions, the jobs at all,
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.960]   have made these last few weeks have really been for users
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.000]   or just control freakishness for business.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.840]   It's keeping Flash off this platform a good thing.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.360]   That's not to be Google fanboy,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.520]   but that's what they say their first consideration is.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.920]   You can make an argument, and this is Apple smart enough
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.400]   to make sure this is the case.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.920]   In every case, you can make an argument
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.880]   that it's for the user, whether it is or not, I don't know.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.560]   It may just be a happy coincidence
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.800]   that what's good for the user is good for Apple.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.160]   Right, I mean, listen, I'm a developer
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.880]   who's working on a Twitter project
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.840]   that threads your replies.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.280]   According to status, that is a feature
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.120]   that Twitter could launch any day.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.280]   They have the data, in fact, they've promised it.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.880]   In some of the API docs, they've made the,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.560]   they've said that they may do that at some point.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.880]   They may be to click on a status
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.000]   and see all their replies directly related to that status.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   That's what my app does.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.240]   Would I be bummed if they launched that
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.560]   and kind of obviated the need for my app a little bit at first,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.400]   but then I would say, okay,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.360]   well, what can I do even better than they do by default?
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.840]   And that's what every developer has to be doing.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.680]   - Fred Wilson in his blog,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.360]   I think if you're a Twitter developer,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.520]   you read Fred carefully right now.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.280]   'Cause Fred is basically, whether intentionally
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.960]   or not becoming the lighthouse, the beacon for,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.920]   well, where do you go now?
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.960]   And he wrote a recent post, very interesting post.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.080]   He says, "The Twitter platform's inflection point
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.640]   in which you really like Twitter
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.040]   to an operating system, to a platform like Macintosh
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.880]   or like Windows. - That's what
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.960]   you invest in, Fred, yeah.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.800]   - Yeah.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.600]   And he says, if, you know, it's clear
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.120]   if you can build large businesses
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.960]   on top of a social platform like Twitter
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.240]   because Twitter is so open and lightweight.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   And here's where you wanna italicize if you're a developer,
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.520]   I'm surprised there aren't more new kinds of killer apps.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.400]   Here are some places where I might think
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.920]   we'd see these killer apps emerge.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.760]   I think Twitter's using Fred.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.080]   Or maybe Fred's using Fred to send a message.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.360]   Okay, well, don't write a desktop client,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.120]   but you might wanna write this.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.600]   - I'm gonna be a chirp this week,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.520]   so I'm gonna talk to quite a few developers, I hope,
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.840]   and I'll be interested to hear what they think.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.960]   - But the question is, do you trust Twitter now?
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.120]   I mean, what's to stop them as soon as you, you know,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.880]   create a social, he talks about social gaming,
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.160]   which by the way, sucks on Twitter.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.560]   Nobody wants you to announce how many people
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.800]   you've killed an IMOB on Twitter.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.480]   Please stop. - No more mayor.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.840]   - Oh, I was recently made a super mayor on Four Square.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.440]   I better take that tweet away.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.320]   Verticals like stock twits and Flix Up, Enterprise,
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.240]   and Discovery.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.440]   I think Discovery's, you know,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.920]   obviously a very interesting thing,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.840]   but remember Twitter bought the search tool
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.920]   and analytics.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.120]   And I think Twitter's in all of these spaces a little bit,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.200]   or not in all of them, but the last two for sure.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.480]   - Yeah, I gotta push Fred,
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.080]   'cause some a few months ago,
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.560]   when I complained about something that Twitter didn't do
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.400]   in terms of being able to put,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.320]   I think we talked about the show,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.840]   earlier on the hashtags together in new ways.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.440]   And Fred kind of slapped me around and said,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.920]   that's what the developers are for, Jeff.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.200]   That's what the outside developers will do.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.640]   That's how this works.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.440]   And... - Yeah, and then if it's good,
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.680]   we'll take it.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.040]   - Well, but we'll take one of them
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.160]   and everybody else gets flicked off.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.480]   - Yeah.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.680]   Yeah, one of you wins.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.160]   Now, maybe that's not a bad thing.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.400]   A lot of people build apps to get bought by Google.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.560]   - I mean, that's life.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.400]   I mean, right?
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.800]   I mean, you know, there's always a group
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   of people doing something
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.400]   and then there's like the one chosen one
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.920]   who out of lock or circumstance or knowing the right person,
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.960]   you know, gets, I mean, that's kind of, I don't know.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.160]   That's kind of the reality.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.000]   - Yeah.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.040]   - Yeah, well, that's why I asked you
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.120]   'cause you're a developer and so you're saying,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.480]   as a developer, it's under--
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.320]   - It's fucked up.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.160]   - Yeah, it's understood.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.080]   - I take it as a challenge.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.800]   I take it as a personal challenge to do it better
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.280]   than the thing that they bought or built in.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.280]   - Yeah.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.120]   - Personally.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.760]   - Well, except you wouldn't, I think, build an iPhone app now
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.600]   because the chances of getting discovery
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   and traffic reduced markedly.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.760]   - Oh, hell you'd build an iPhone app.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.000]   Of course you'd build an iPhone app.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.200]   Well, you'd build an iPad app as well, but--
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.040]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.520]   - Don't you think you'd wanna,
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.480]   I don't think the gold rush for iPhone apps
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.160]   has died out at all.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.440]   - I mean, for Twitter?
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.280]   - Oh, for Twitter?
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.120]   Oh, for Twitter, yeah.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.480]   - I'm sorry, I misunderstood, yes.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   - Yeah, yeah, just--
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.920]   - Yeah, I'd build an analytics app for Twitter.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.280]   I mean, I would do a different kind of app.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.280]   I wouldn't do just a regular client app.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.320]   - I still think, as my friend,
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.160]   Steve Gilmore has always said that search and tracking
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.080]   are the key uses of Twitter.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.680]   You've got this huge database of information
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.880]   that is not well-mind.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.720]   I mean, that's what you do.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.520]   That's what your application does, Gina.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.760]   - That is what I'm working on.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.680]   And in fact, I have a little plug for this week.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.600]   The Twitter project that I work on called Think Tank
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.160]   is going into action this week.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.680]   Everyone who's listening to it's way right now,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.200]   please who's on Twitter, go on Twitter
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.280]   and follow White House at White House.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   White House is gonna put out a question this week
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.040]   about the nation's technological and scientific priorities,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.960]   what they should be.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.640]   And if you reply to those questions on Twitter,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.680]   my app is gonna collate those replies
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.800]   and the White House is gonna listen to you.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   Basically, the White House is gonna be watching
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.840]   and listening and keeping track of what people reply,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.760]   using my app. - First.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.160]   - So I hope everyone will follow White House right now.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.880]   And then in the next few days, Monday through Wednesday,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.400]   there'll be a question put out.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.760]   And if you reply to that question,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.560]   I hope you break my database.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.560]   - You got 1.7 million people who could respond to this.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.400]   So that's great. - Yes, yes we do.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   Yes we do. - Wow.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.320]   - I'm a little nervous.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.080]   I have to tell you, it's a pretty surreal feeling
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.520]   knowing that something that you started as a hobby
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.720]   is being used by the White House.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.600]   It's a little, I haven't gotten very much sleep
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.560]   the last couple of nights.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.760]   - How exciting Gina.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.360]   - That's really, really exciting.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.840]   So yeah, just kind of an example of something
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.800]   that you can do that Twitter doesn't do right now.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   I mean, hey, but like I said,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.400]   Twitter could launch, threaded replies pretty easily
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   any day now. - Right.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.240]   - And I accept that, but my app does more so.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.600]   - Right. - Well, I also think that
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.120]   if I put myself in the EV and business shoes,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.560]   what you, what's, they actually played this pretty well.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.760]   So they created this really trivial idea,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.920]   which is kind of group text messaging, I guess.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.520]   And it would follow.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.720]   And who knew where it was gonna go?
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.840]   I don't think anybody knew it was gonna go where it went.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   But it became thanks to their very open API
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.080]   and the enthusiasm of third party developers.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.520]   It became this great value and a huge growth,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.080]   a valuable database of information.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.200]   And now the real fun and interesting thing to think about
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.560]   is how you can use this information.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   And it seems to me that even if Twitter got very active
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.440]   and creating answers to that question, there's plenty more.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.800]   - There is, the possibilities are insane.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.600]   - There are endless, there are endless, there are endless.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.480]   - And only getting better as the data gets richer.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.920]   And it's growing astronomically.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.360]   And what's very interesting is it's growing globally
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.040]   faster now than it is in the US.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.600]   So it's really, and I've really thought of this
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.200]   for the last year or so as an analog
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.880]   to an internet nervous system.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   It really is, it's all these connections.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.640]   And the more that you, just as the brain is good
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.200]   because it's non-linear, it's heavily parallel.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.320]   Twitter is like that.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.920]   It's these very rich interconnections
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.360]   are much more than linear.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.080]   And there's so much information in there because of it.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.920]   - So should Google have done buzz ever and all?
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.760]   I mean--
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.360]   - Yes, I wish they'd do it better.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.160]   - Absolutely, I think, yeah.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.200]   I mean, I think buzz brings value to the table too.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.600]   I mean, some people really love,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.800]   I mean, some people really love buzz and use it a lot.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.680]   I mean, I think it's,
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.880]   I don't think that we want to have one single place.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.400]   - You know why I'm glad they did buzz
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.680]   and I wish buzz were doing better
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.760]   is because Twitter is a silo ultimately.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.320]   Even if they've got APIs
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.680]   and they encourage third party developers,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.920]   acquiring Tweety just underscores the fact
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.080]   that ultimately it is a single company
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   and who controls the data as much or as little as they want.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   Whereas if you have, and Google could be the same,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.080]   but what they did is open standards,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.800]   open it's federated, shinnable,
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.160]   and set a rebel and could in theory,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.080]   and I hope it will in practice,
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.320]   become something that is much bigger than any one company
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.720]   becomes in fact a standard.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.120]   That's what we want, right?
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.280]   We want dial tone.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.920]   - Exactly right.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.640]   - So Twitter could never be,
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.200]   Twitter wants to be the dial tone,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.040]   but it's one company,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.320]   I don't want one company to control the internet dial tone.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.840]   - Absolutely agree, couldn't agree more.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.920]   - Yeah, so if it's gonna be the internet nervous system,
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.400]   it's gotta be in many hands,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.240]   it's gotta be open to anybody who wants to play
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.400]   and you should, and then if Twitter comes along,
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.480]   and then if you know somebody,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.320]   Google comes along and says,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   well we anoint this as the definitive third party buzzing tool.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.680]   In fact, Google did create a buzz,
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.760]   which it, it doesn't matter,
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.760]   because that's just one view into a much larger universe.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.680]   - Have they even announced that buzz will become federated?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.320]   - The Federation was in theory part of the,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.680]   - It was part of the original thought.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.520]   - Yeah.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.480]   - Oh, okay, I knew it wasn't Wave,
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.840]   I wasn't sure that buzz,
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.680]   that was true.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.000]   - No, no, I believe it is the case.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.320]   Now, correct me if I'm wrong
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.920]   and we have a lot of very smart listeners
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.840]   who are paying attention to this,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.240]   but it's my understanding that while they,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.440]   the API is very scant,
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.440]   they haven't even given enough information
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.280]   to write a third party app yet,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   but that because of the various different rest and so forth,
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.880]   the API's that they planned it and learn or will implement,
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.600]   you could write a buzz clone.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.320]   - That's fantastic, that's huge.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.520]   - That would interoperate.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.080]   - It's part of the thing about Wave that I love,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   the fact that it's federated
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.200]   and that you don't necessarily ever have to go through
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.120]   Google servers to communicate using it.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.520]   That's huge. - Yeah.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.360]   - Huge, huge.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.600]   - Very important, otherwise it's,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.840]   it's one company and we've learned.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.280]   - It's such a good failure.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.160]   - Yep. - I hope we look back on the 90s
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.720]   in a couple of decades as the stupid time
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.000]   when there were two operating system companies.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.360]   - Right. - And that was,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.880]   and that you had to choose and that's dumb.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.640]   - So you'd love to think of the sort of comful circle.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680]   I remember back in the day when there was like
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.000]   a mainframe computer and that was your one central point
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.040]   of failure and then, you know, the web and now,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.280]   and now we're kind of back to this point
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.800]   where we have these cloud services
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   which are becoming the central point of failure and contact.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.040]   - Yeah, we need to go back to that peer-to-peer data sharing.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.080]   - And to, by the way,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.800]   but somebody's saying buzz was Google only, that's true.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.240]   They're not gonna have a buzz server
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.880]   that I could run as you could have a wave server
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.200]   that you could run. - Okay.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.840]   - But the standards are there so that I could have a server
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.600]   that would interoperate at a, as a peer with buzz.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   - I see.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.040]   - So that's what to me is federation.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.920]   I don't have to use the buzz server.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.720]   In fact, it's better than I don't have to use the buzz server,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.040]   but I can use industry standard APIs
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.320]   to communicate as a peer with buzz.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.480]   - Okay. - Right?
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.760]   - Okay, yes, I see what you mean.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.360]   - And, you know, one would hope that would happen
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.800]   with Twitter as well at some point,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   but see, this is where the Twitter company
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.280]   is not exactly as open as I'd like.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.600]   They don't give you the fire hose.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.200]   They don't give, you know, you have limited an API calls.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.080]   If your Facebook, you know, you know,
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.320]   Facebook won't let you store the data for longer than 24 hours.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.040]   There's all these, these companies are really nervous
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.520]   about letting go of their assets.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.760]   - And then jobs not to go back to him, but he's, you know.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.240]   - Well, this gets back to that.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.680]   - I don't think jobs is much more close than any of these.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.360]   I mean, you do have a full browser on here
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.120]   and you've got WebKit and the, you know, okay,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   iPhone 4.0, they announced you can't develop
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.880]   with anything but Apple tools,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.160]   which I'm sure is kind of developers up in arms.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.080]   - They are up in arms.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:24.920]   - Yeah.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.480]   - And adapting from Flash is for both, right?
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.240]   - And, you know, certainly it's in Apple's business interests.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.880]   They've decided that they don't want Flash
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.520]   and they're gonna kill Flash.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.400]   But it's also for a user's point of view
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.520]   because as everybody knows, these kind of, you know,
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:45.520]   these phony APIs or phony interfaces
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.680]   are never quite as good as the native interface.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.840]   You know, the Java swing is never quite as good
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.960]   as the native interface.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.080]   And that's basically what Apple's saying is,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.040]   no, you gotta use the native interface from us.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.200]   - Eric Schoenfeld wrote a piece of TechCrunch this week
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.720]   that is on the feed.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.560]   - Yes, on the, yeah.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.880]   - Is Steve Jobs ignoring history or trying to rewrite it?
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.240]   And he's arguing that he sees ghosts of the 90s
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.600]   in this effort, that in this world now,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.240]   Google is Microsoft getting its operating system,
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.520]   various stripes out everywhere.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.760]   And Apple is doing its quality shtick and controlling
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.120]   mightily and asking whether he's limiting himself
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.240]   too much again.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   - I've been thinking about this a little bit
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.560]   because, you know, Apple did not believe in apps.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.760]   I don't think, well, I think when the iPhone came out,
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.360]   remember there was only web applications.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.960]   - As Jake said to me this morning,
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.480]   remember that it was a really dull phone.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.240]   - It was horrible.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.440]   And everybody wanted apps.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.400]   And I think Apple is, you know,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.480]   this, it happens again and again in the industry.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.360]   Apple didn't know that apps was gonna be the next big thing
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.680]   and just said, okay, well, we'll let you have apps.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.240]   And suddenly it's the next big thing.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.680]   And so now they're capitalizing on it.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   - I mean, Apple believes in whatever it offers at the time.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.240]   They didn't believe in copy and paste for a long time.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.080]   - Exactly.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.760]   - I mean, let's, you know, let's be honest.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.520]   - No, but I'm saying you can't give them credit
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.840]   that they knew about apps, they planned apps
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.160]   and then they came along and it just took a little while.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.240]   I don't think so.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.360]   I think they didn't believe in apps.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.600]   I think that they just as, you know,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.040]   Palm kind of wanted to push web apps as well.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.280]   And frankly, that's the open.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.720]   Isn't that the open thing that you were just talking about?
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.680]   - It's the irony is the apps are what
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   given him the control that he wants.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.280]   - But nobody, but this is my point.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.120]   If all Steve Jobs wanted was control,
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.480]   he wouldn't be pushing web apps.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.920]   He would have pushed apps from day one.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   He didn't know apps are gonna take off.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.800]   He thought it was gonna be web apps, the open standard.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.040]   He believed-- - In the Google way.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.000]   - He supported the open web.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.120]   And this is why the market is very interesting.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.960]   The market doesn't have this political agenda
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.480]   that you and I, we do.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.240]   It doesn't know open from not open.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.000]   It just uses what it likes.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.880]   Happens to like apps.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.960]   So I don't know if you blame Steve Jobs for this.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.000]   Steve Jobs just goes, "Oh, you want apps?"
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.800]   - Great, good for us.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.440]   We'll take 30% everything.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.600]   But I don't know if he planned that.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.720]   I don't think he did.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:11.120]   And boy, again, we look back at the last few years
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.520]   in 10 years from now, we're gonna say,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.000]   what was the big development apps?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.840]   Or maybe not.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.800]   Maybe we'll look back and say,
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.000]   God, wasn't that awful?
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.840]   How do we go to like with CD-ROMs?
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.200]   How do we go down that road?
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.320]   - That's what I'm trying to figure out
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.600]   the right way to ask the question, Leo.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.480]   Yeah, I just, I sense something bigger here
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.720]   in this whole app thing that is an architectural shift
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.760]   in the web.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.640]   Just as I was arguing that we're moving past
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.800]   a page-based site-based web
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.880]   and things get distributed in streams and flows,
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.000]   the app movement is precisely what I heard
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.840]   he agrees the answer.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.160]   - I agree with you.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.440]   But would you disagree that this is what
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.640]   the market has asked for?
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.040]   - In those devices, no, I absolutely agree.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.760]   - So who do you blame?
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.160]   You blame Steve or the market?
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   - I don't know that I blame anyone.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.560]   I just wanna see what the implications are
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.960]   and figure out what both the opportunities and risks are.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.400]   - I'm not too worried, 'cause look,
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.200]   I don't think the open web is gonna go away
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.880]   because everybody likes apps.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.560]   - I don't either.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.560]   I mean, there's room for both, right?
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.320]   We want both.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.440]   I mean, the issue that I have with the,
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.160]   the issue that I have is I can't navigate
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   to a web page or a market and download an app
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.160]   that a developer has posted without Apple
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.440]   getting involved in the middle.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.280]   - I agree.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.320]   - That's the issue.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.160]   It's not really--
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.720]   - You're not against apps.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.160]   - I'm not against apps, no.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.960]   I'm against the fact that I can't install
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.360]   whatever I want on my phone.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.200]   That's the problem.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.160]   - Exactly, that's one, Gina.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.800]   The other one is that inside that app
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.000]   is information and data that you can't get to,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   that you can't search via Google,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.320]   you can't link to.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.240]   - Right, right.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.920]   - That's trapped in that app.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.960]   And that's in the interest of the app maker, it would seem,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.840]   but if you think in a distributed web at the same time,
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   you wanna expose that data and how do you do that?
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.680]   So to defend--
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   - Maybe that's Google's failing,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.560]   that Google hasn't been searching the guts
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.920]   of apps for the last two years.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.880]   - But these are all abstractions that we're aware of,
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.000]   but that the end user couldn't care less about.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.440]   And I think one of the things that's gonna appeal
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.280]   to end users about the iPad is they don't have to think
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.240]   about where their data is.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.120]   It's not an issue.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.680]   - But look at this video, if I leave all my restaurant
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.760]   reviews and all my restaurant data and everything else
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.880]   in Four Square versus Yelp,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.760]   in Yelp, I can become the new restaurant critic
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.720]   of the world in Four Square, as I understand it,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.240]   I don't think it can be discoverable.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   - Right.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.320]   - Right, that's the kind of issue,
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.520]   so there's an implication of my actions.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.080]   I'm investing my effort into something, into a space
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.400]   where I don't know what's necessarily going to mean
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.240]   to me and my value.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.160]   - So, again, I'm playing the pure pragmatist
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.360]   and not an intellectual purist here at all.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.840]   - Because it was Gina's role today.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.760]   - Well, I'm completely in agree with all,
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.520]   you know, I agree with you about all this.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.640]   But from a purely pragmatic point of view,
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.520]   then it doesn't eventually, doesn't the market force
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.920]   Four Square to open this up because really the value
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.040]   to Four Square is the network effect.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.600]   - I hope so, and I think, well, more to the point,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.120]   not that the market forces it, but Four Square is the first
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.960]   to see the opportunity.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.120]   - That's where the value is.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.400]   - That's where the value is.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   - So ultimately, as long as there's value in openness
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.720]   and you get the network effect, as long as there's value
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.680]   in federation, Twitter's going to get moved
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.120]   towards federation, unless they have this monopolistic
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.480]   Rupert Murdoch, we got to play the Rupert Murdoch clip,
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   this monopolistic Rupert Murdoch attitude towards the world,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   the trend is our friend, is it not?
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.600]   So in a way, maybe this is just the natural ecosystem.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   You get an individual, an entrepreneur who's going to,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.840]   it's like the patent system.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.080]   You get for 16 years, you get the benefit,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.720]   but then eventually it's got to open
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   because it can't grow beyond a certain point
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.320]   as long as one company's doing it.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.200]   - Right, so if your Google shouldn't Google have been seeing
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.520]   this coming more and trying to push app makers to say,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.080]   here's a standard by which you can make your app
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.560]   stuff discoverable and we can search it,
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.400]   we can do this with that.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.760]   They've been doing that with content companies,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.480]   media companies, but not with these app makers
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.680]   that are the future media.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.240]   The irony to me is, if I'm Google,
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.960]   if I'm Google, I sit back and say,
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.960]   don't worry, they'll come around.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.560]   - Maybe, yes, okay, fine, 'cause you're Google,
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.880]   but that's part of what I'm saying is,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.840]   maybe Google's not Google anymore in this shift of the world.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.440]   Maybe Google does lose the path to stuff,
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.000]   you'll hear, we're not gonna suck a second,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.040]   and you'll hear Steve Jobs more than anyone saying,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.920]   ah, path, search, people are just searching.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.360]   - I know, it was so funny that he said that.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.680]   - And Google came back and argued,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.040]   well, yes, here's our numbers, yes, they do.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.400]   And what search, you know, is search Google goggles
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.640]   and all that? - Right.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.440]   I have to say, I think Google's getting a little
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.560]   into the weeds and by, for instance,
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.000]   they've made a big mistake by becoming so attached
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.200]   to the Nexus One and the Android.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.400]   - I think that's a, there's a risk for Google here,
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.560]   here I am, Google fanboy saying, watch out Google.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.840]   I think there's something going on here
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.520]   that's bigger than they necessarily see.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.080]   - They said the right thing when they said,
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.000]   oh, all we care about is we use the internet more
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.560]   and we benefit.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.920]   If they would just stay there and say,
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.200]   we're just gonna keep doing things
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.160]   that make you use the internet more.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.000]   - Exactly.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.280]   - I think their model is great.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.840]   As soon as they get in the weeds and say, yeah,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   but we really wanna win the app war,
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.760]   it's like, no, no, that's a mistake.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.600]   'Cause they're in channel conflict with the whole web.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   - Yes.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.240]   - To me the interesting thing is what media companies
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.760]   have done versus tech companies?
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.160]   Media companies, content is not an application.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.760]   The only reason to do an application like Time magazine
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.360]   is to put a wall around your content.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.200]   - I agree.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.040]   - If you don't do anything more,
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.280]   it is not a frigging application people.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.200]   It's just a page.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.360]   - Well, wait a minute.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.560]   Play devil's advocate, popular science to this great app.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.440]   And maybe they didn't do anything you couldn't do
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.280]   with HTML5, I don't know.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   - I actually found it to be a bit bothersome.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.200]   - I can't even figure how to use it to be.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.440]   - I see how it's not good.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.280]   (laughing)
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.120]   - What?
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.520]   - It was a TV role plan, man.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.520]   - Okay, it's kind of--
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.160]   - It's like you know the app that I don't know.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.720]   - This kind of know UI.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.560]   (laughing)
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.400]   - Yeah.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.240]   - It's like, what do I do?
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.720]   And this is actually, if I would say there's a problem
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.440]   with the iPad, that's the problem,
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.880]   is that the UI is not particularly discoverable.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.160]   You kind of keep kind of swiping and doing things
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.000]   until something happens.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.440]   - Oh, this sounds familiar.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.040]   - That's not good.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.200]   - This sounds familiar.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.720]   - You know what, I deleted the pop site.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah, you're right, you.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.720]   - I think I deleted the pop site.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   - It seems like the dichotomy that we're talking about
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.200]   is Chrome OS versus Android, right?
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.360]   Chrome OS is just what I've asked.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   - Wait, so I need help with that.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.200]   - What's that, Jeff?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   - So I need help with that.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.560]   So when you talk about Chrome OS,
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.520]   and Google's seen a web app based world,
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.960]   is that different from what Apple sees in essence?
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.000]   Is it necessarily more--
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.840]   - I think it is different.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.800]   Google doesn't know what the answer is.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.680]   And I think that because Google has Android,
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.080]   which is apps plus a browser,
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.920]   and they have also Chrome OS,
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.800]   which is just a netbook operating system, right?
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.880]   That just acts as web apps,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.040]   that they're trying to figure out
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.720]   the answer to the question themselves.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.040]   I mean, do you think that Chrome OS
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.840]   is gonna look positively anemic
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.320]   next to the iPad operating system?
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.960]   I mean, it's like, it's links to web apps.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.800]   That's what it is.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.840]   - I installed hexes, Chromium thing.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.360]   And it's like, well, this is just a browser.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.720]   - It's a browser, right?
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.240]   (laughs)
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.840]   - Where else, where's the rest of it?
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.680]   You know, I'm from Shen.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.520]   - Right, yeah.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.360]   - Okay, so stay there for a second.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.040]   Then what we're saying here is
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.600]   that we're shifting the credit.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.160]   They'll both be around.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.760]   But in terms of where the sex is,
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.040]   and where the attention is,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.360]   and where the money is thought to be,
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.920]   people think it's suddenly they're following
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.600]   the shiny object of the apps,
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.800]   rather than the browser.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.200]   And the browser was the standard
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.800]   that tied all information together
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.640]   through a simple address and link.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   - And we're now losing that.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.200]   - Well, you know, by the way,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.720]   there are apps that, there should be apps.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.480]   There are plenty of apps where you're not,
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.400]   you know, you're playing a game,
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.360]   or you're not creating data,
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.840]   or you don't need to be searchable.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.040]   There are plenty of places for apps to exist.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.320]   So let's say that that's not what we're talking about.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.520]   - Or functions like writing your text.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.360]   - Yeah.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.760]   - But we're talking about content encapsulated in that.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.280]   - Right, and that's the funny thing about this,
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.160]   is that you look at brands like, you know,
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.960]   Four Square to Bank of America
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.240]   have made apps for Android,
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.800]   but the New York Times and the Guardian haven't.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.880]   And I think that, you know,
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.400]   Android is a much bigger audience now than iPad,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   but they followed the shiny view to saying,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.960]   "Well, what apps really mean is control for content."
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.440]   And so I guess I'm concerned not about apps as apps.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.360]   Apps, you know, making me a good, cute word processor,
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.840]   or maps or things like that.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.200]   God bless Bravo.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.320]   - Well, I guess that was my question is,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.800]   I guess I shouldn't have mentioned the popular science app,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.720]   but what if there were a,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.840]   you could do it in that better than you could do on the web?
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.680]   Wouldn't that be a bad--
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.680]   - You show it to me, boss.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.520]   Show it to me.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.880]   - Yeah, maybe that-- - I haven't seen it yet.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   - Yeah. - I thought the PopSci app was it.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.240]   That was the one regret I had about the iPad,
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.960]   was like not, it was not having the PopSci.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.120]   - It turns out-- - Everyone seemed to love it.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.960]   - I've deleted it, I didn't realize I had that.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.520]   - But the most regional app is that they wanted,
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.280]   they now take the same exact content
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.000]   that I pay for on the web.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.160]   They put little keys over half of it saying,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   "No, no, no, you can have that,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.920]   you have to pay us double now."
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.160]   - Well, here's an example, this is a free app
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.400]   called Big Oven, Epicurious has one as well,
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.960]   it's a recipe app, right?
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.320]   So I'm not sure it's any different than having,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.760]   I mean, you could have done all of this in a browser,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.080]   I don't think it's any different than a browser.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.920]   - Back of the day, I helped create Epicurious.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.400]   - Yeah. - Oh, wow, nice.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.240]   - I mean, it's pretty. - Thank you.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.520]   - I love Epicurious. - Yeah, it's an Epicurious.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.440]   - Yeah, add two tablespoons of olive oil.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   - So really, all you're adding here is a UI on that,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   on top of, but-- - I'm trying to tart up content.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.000]   - You're tarting it up, that's a very good way to put it.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.920]   - What about the book that Jenny Jardin wrote up?
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   It was a medical book with 3D objects that you could,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.160]   I don't know if it was a medical book or--
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.320]   - No, it was no assist, it's the elements,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.240]   let me show you, this was originally a coffee table book.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.040]   Talk about tarting up content, I mean,
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.440]   really all you have here is the periodic table
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.800]   of the elements, but they've, oh, they just crashed on me too.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.760]   - I had a lot of that going on, by the way.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.440]   - Yeah, a lot of quitting out,
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.480]   and I don't know if that needs a restart.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.320]   Yes, he's doing it again.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.120]   - Oh, dope. - It happens a lot.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.960]   - A meal is ironing me, and he just said to me,
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.920]   not a single person who has the Pops I app
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.680]   can name a story, they read in it.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.840]   - Right, it's pretty.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.520]   - It was a play, they play with it.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.680]   They don't actually read anything. - This is the same thing.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.840]   So this is zinc, right, and if I could go to the next page,
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.360]   which I apparently can't, 'cause it has too many elements
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.440]   on it, it's crashing.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.760]   It gives you rotating versions of this,
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.080]   there's an interface to Wolfram Alpha,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.520]   so it's looking up zinc on Wolfram Alpha,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.320]   but this is $14, and it's a coffee table book
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.840]   put into a app, and you know what, it's eye candy.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.800]   I don't think it's particularly useful.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.520]   - Oh, it's expensive to do, and--
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.480]   - This is a CD-ROM. - Not about as searchable.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.320]   If you wanna say, hey kids,
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.840]   this is the best damn zinc page I've ever seen,
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   you can't link to it.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.000]   - Right, you can't share it. - That's the tragedy.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.600]   - Well, it's not the tragedy for the elements,
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   'cause then you can say, pay $13.99,
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.440]   and you can see it.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   - Well, there's plenty of other elements pages,
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.280]   maybe they don't rotate.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.000]   - It hasn't changed, man.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.200]   - Exactly.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.560]   The content is not better on this.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.000]   It's tarding it up, it's a perfect way to phrase that.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.440]   - Right, so what we see here is media companies
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.800]   think suddenly that they are software companies,
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.440]   and all they really want is,
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.880]   hello, Robert Murdoch, is they want a fence,
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.360]   because they think that returns them to their old control.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.920]   - Well, here's the good news, though, Jeff.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.800]   It ain't gonna work, you know that, and I know that.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.680]   We laugh, we mock these people.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.240]   - It's actually gonna kill some media companies
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.040]   along the way, I really believe that.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.000]   This is as Richard Jinger, the CEO of Solan,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.840]   said it is a fatal distraction.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.040]   - Yes, well, that's well put, which companies?
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.920]   That's their problem.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   - If a kid-- - My shoes were dancing
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.960]   on their graves, I'm actually not,
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.240]   I'm wishing they wouldn't kill themselves,
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.120]   but if they do, they do.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.800]   - Yeah, really, if there's a message to what you're saying
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.480]   is don't do this, 'cause it's bad for you.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.440]   Ultimately, it's not bad for us because frankly,
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.920]   it ain't gonna work.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.160]   - That's what I actually try to say to Mr. Murdoch,
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.440]   but I'll never listen.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.760]   - Well, we're gonna find out what Rupert,
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.440]   let me see, one more time, I restarted the iPad.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.600]   One more time, let's see if it'll do it.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.000]   - This is what you get when you buy first generation kids.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.920]   - No, no, no, it was a memory issue,
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.760]   so now it's working.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.040]   And if you look at Gina, even as developer,
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.880]   you gotta appreciate this,
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.640]   all of these spin independently.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.000]   - No, why does that teach me?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.280]   - Nothing, it's just cool.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.040]   And watch, they even degrade independently.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.880]   Cool!
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.680]   - That's cool, that was a neat little.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.160]   - It's cool. - And your killed us.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.800]   - It's like a CD-ROM, it's all it is.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.640]   - It's a CD-ROM.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.440]   - That is the CD-ROM analogy, I get it now.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.760]   - That's all.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.360]   And I resisted buying this,
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.880]   then Jenny finally talked me into buying it,
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.680]   but, and I'm, you know, okay, nice, great, wonderful.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.840]   But--
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.000]   - I wanna scream Jane, stop this crazy thing.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.680]   - Interesting, a lot more cynicism
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.880]   about the iPad this week.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.440]   - I love, no, no, don't you,
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.400]   you tried this out of my cold, dead fingers.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.800]   - Yeah, can we get him right after last week?
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.400]   - I tried to get you to buy one.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.640]   I miss figures, we tried to get Leo to return his.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.480]   - Hell no.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.600]   - It's not ties him.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.720]   - How quickly things changed in seven days?
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.760]   - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.160]   don't misunderstand me, this thing,
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.200]   I hardly used anything else this week.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.000]   I didn't use my laptop but twice.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.440]   And that was for the kinds of things like Expedia,
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.720]   where you go online, you wanna buy something.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.280]   And it's a little hard to do all that in here.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:32.400]   But for consumption of content, for gaming,
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.880]   even for browsing, for email,
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.400]   I find this far superior.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.600]   I hardly used a desktop or a laptop at all this year.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.440]   This is a week. - Wow.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.280]   - Yeah.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.840]   - I'm gonna ask you again in like six or seven weeks.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.560]   - Yeah, everybody says, "Oh, Leo, Tyre,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.520]   "but it's just another gadget, I don't think so."
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.400]   - My son predicted that it would gather dust on the shelf.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.600]   - Well, it's an interesting thought.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.640]   There's certainly a lot of people thinking that.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.440]   And I have a feeling that it's gonna go the other way.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.680]   We'll see. We shall see.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.040]   We're gonna listen to what Rupert said about Google
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.400]   and how wrong he got it in just a little bit,
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.000]   but let me pay some bills and then we'll continue on.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.080]   You're listening to this week in Google
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.000]   with Gina Trapani from smarterwhere.org
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.800]   and Jeff Jarvis of buzzmachine.com.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.840]   And brought to you this week by Go To Meeting,
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.000]   those friends at Citrix have done it again.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.640]   They're the kings of remote access.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.840]   They did the enterprise level remote access.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.880]   That Windows uses, if you're in a business,
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.240]   you know what Citrix means.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.960]   That's a big name.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.640]   They do consumer grade stuff too
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.000]   that's really fast, easy, simple works on max NPCs,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.760]   like Go To My PC and Go To Assist and Go To Meeting.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.160]   Go To Meeting eliminates the need for business travel.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.320]   I mean, who can afford to fly across a country
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.680]   for an hour meeting or drive across town for half an hour?
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.440]   With Go To Meeting, you get more done.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.000]   You meet over the phone, but it's still visual.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.880]   You can still see the PowerPoint presentation,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.680]   the product demo.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.240]   You can still see the spreadsheets
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.720]   collaborate together on documents.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.880]   It brings any conference call up,
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.560]   much more exciting, much more engaging
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.560]   and it gets a lot more done with a lot less travel.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.040]   And talk about affordable, $49 a month
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.240]   for as many meetings as you want,
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.720]   as long as you want and that includes free voiceover,
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.040]   internet and phone teleconferencing.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.360]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/twig,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   gotoMeeting.com/twig, you can try this free for 30 days,
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.000]   no obligation, unlimited meetings for the next 30 days.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.920]   You know, I know when a company does this,
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.400]   that's their, that's a standard mind of product.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.320]   How do they sell this product?
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.920]   They say, "Try it, try it free for 30 days."
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.880]   We think you're gonna find a lot of ways to use it.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.400]   I know we do, we use it all the time at Twit.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.360]   Go To Meeting and by the way, we pay for our account.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.640]   Just, and we have several that we pay for it
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.800]   'cause it's so great.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.600]   Go toMeeting.com/twig, thank you so much
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.840]   for your support of this week in Google, Citrix.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.680]   Shall I play this?
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.000]   Now what does it explain first of all, Jeff,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.600]   what this cut comes from?
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.200]   - So, Rupert Murdoch, who's been saying much
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.360]   at the same time, but I just found it amusing.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.080]   It sounds like the old tubes and pipes discussion
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.840]   from our former center of the class.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.200]   - Center of Stephen. - Yeah.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.720]   - And he was in Washington doing a talk.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.840]   He's been out there preaching more recently
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.720]   and it was at, I think George Washington University
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.560]   with a journalist.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.200]   And so I just found it amusing.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.280]   Maybe you won't, but I thought it was amusing hearing
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   Rupert discovered the internet.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.560]   And by the way, let's remember here,
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.800]   as we listened to this, Michael Wolfe, his biographer,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.080]   said that his last knowledge, Rupert had never touched
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.160]   a computer or used Google.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.440]   Well now you'll hear that he touches the iPad
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.720]   if you consider that computer.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.560]   Sorry.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.040]   - This is, by the way, it's Matt Wells
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.640]   and it is the--
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.480]   - The Guardian.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.440]   - The Guardian, it's their Media Talk podcast.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.600]   And 15 minutes in on the April 9 episode,
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.800]   this is what you'll hear.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.720]   - Google taking his journalism for free.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.920]   - We're gonna stop people like Google, Microsoft,
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.960]   or whoever taking our stories for nothing.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.640]   Please stop being, what exactly?
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.440]   Well, if you go to Google News and you see stories
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.200]   and it says Wall Street Journal, you tap on it
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.240]   and you suddenly get the page of the story
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.320]   as in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.480]   And it's for free.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.320]   - Right.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.760]   - And they take it for nothing and they've got this
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.800]   very clever business model which is,
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.040]   and they've invented almost a new type of advertising,
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.320]   search advertising.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.360]   And so if they just pour out
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.520]   tens of millions of words a day, one way or another,
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.320]   they have key words in there which tie to advertising
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.360]   beside it.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.520]   And it's produced a river of gold.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.640]   And I think they would have stopped it.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.320]   The newspapers would have stand up.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.880]   - Oh, so you can remember--
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.560]   - I hope they do stop it, Rupert.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.600]   Back in the earliest days of the internet,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.960]   I held focus groups in Cleveland.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.680]   And we had people there who sat in there
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.760]   in the earliest days and they said,
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   "You know, there's this amazing company
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.240]   "that's bought all the content you can imagine.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.440]   "In psychopedias and medical stuff and news
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.800]   "and everything that it has, everything.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.920]   "It's called Netscape."
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.200]   - Oh, honestly think.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.320]   - That's it, that's what he thinks.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   - That the Google is the internet.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.600]   - So when I go to the Google,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.520]   and I search for my journal and I see my journal--
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.280]   - And I click on it, there's the page.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.680]   That's my stuff, it's free.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.960]   - Yes, you're serving it up.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.120]   - Your page, he doesn't, clearly doesn't know.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.920]   And I'm surprised that nobody's sat down with him
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.040]   and probably they're scared of it.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.520]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.760]   You don't want to be the one to do that.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.280]   - No, Rupert, let me explain this.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.600]   We spend millions of dollars a year
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.400]   to put that page on the internet.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.480]   And if Google didn't point to it, no one would find it.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:05.200]   See, they're coming to our site, Rupert, that's us.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.760]   He clearly doesn't, I mean, I don't understand
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.000]   what he's even saying.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.840]   - No.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.400]   - It's like-- - You have to hold it.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.400]   - Is he implying that Google's putting ads
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.480]   on the Wall Street Journal page?
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:19.320]   - He thinks that Google is creating tons of content today
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.280]   by doing this.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.120]   He just doesn't know what this internet is.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.920]   - In all charitableness, I'm really trying to,
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.720]   'cause I assume he's an intelligent person.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.160]   He's been very successful.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.080]   That I'm trying to understand,
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:37.240]   presuming that he knows that he paid for that page.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.400]   I'm trying to understand what he might be thinking.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.600]   He's probably thinking, well, there'll be no value
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   to Google at all if it couldn't link to people.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.000]   So the value that Google has, the billions of dollars
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.520]   that Google is worth comes from the fact
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.440]   that they link to our content.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.440]   Does he want money from Google,
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.760]   or does he want them not to do it anymore?
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.480]   - Well, right now we say he doesn't want him to do it anymore.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.560]   - See, that's where he's kinda cuckoo.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.680]   - 'Cause he could do it right now,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.960]   but obviously, he's smart,
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.080]   he reminds in his company, he's already ignoring the boss.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.320]   - Somebody's Martin Sassenberg,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.920]   who's a German listener in Germany.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.480]   Germany, for some reason, has decided,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.400]   as we've talked about before,
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.400]   that they don't like the Google Street View.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:27.080]   And he sent me a, obviously, Photoshop street sign
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.400]   from Germany, it has a town name,
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.440]   and then a no-robot's text below it.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.480]   (laughing)
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.160]   Did you ever see the humor I liked?
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.000]   - Isn't that good?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.120]   It's very geeky humor.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.160]   If I can find it, I'll show you.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.000]   It's very funny.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.480]   - Hold on, so you gotta see this one.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.320]   This is another one.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.440]   Search for Google HomeView on Google.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.160]   If in German, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.400]   It's worth the laugh.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.240]   You'll go to an LA Times page, first off.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.520]   - Yep, I see it.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.880]   - And then click on that video.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.320]   - By the way, thank you, Google, for that search.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.440]   And the LA Times should be thanking Google for that search,
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.820]   because now I'm seeing an LA Times page
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:06.160]   with ads for Verizon, California, Lutheran University,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.320]   all of which is monetized by not Google,
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.960]   by the LA Times.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.000]   - And by the way, folks out there,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.400]   if you really want the translation, the LA Times,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.320]   now thanks to crowdsourcing hasn't.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.680]   Here's the name.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.920]   - Google HomeView.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:28.440]   - I love it that the subtitles of this are in French.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.800]   I have pictures of your apartment.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.080]   - Yeah, you translate.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.480]   You speak German.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.920]   - Can we come in?
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.360]   Yes, I have a living room.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.680]   - Living room.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.760]   - A bedroom kitchen.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.000]   There's the Google man writing it all down.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.160]   (speaking in French)
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:56:01.920]   - So he's leading him through the house.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.760]   There they are.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.000]   And it says, "Are you going through all of Germany?
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.600]   "Every house, yes?
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.760]   "Every house in Germany, every piece of furniture."
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.480]   - And the heater, my house from in Anne Fauffin?
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.200]   - Yes, from the house from Anne Fauffin.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.960]   - We get the outside and the inside.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.840]   Would you like to sit on the sofa, please?
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.200]   So they're taking pictures of them sitting on the sofa.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.360]   (speaking in French)
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:35.840]   - Don't worry, we see it's a real pigstyze.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.760]   - It's the bed's made.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.360]   - Well, here in Fauffin.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.280]   Fauffin is left to him.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   (speaking in French)
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.640]   - He's visiting the Darnschutzpischdumung
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   that's most tied as a gepexid.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.320]   - We have to have this partially pixelated
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.400]   because of privacy.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.480]   (laughing)
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.800]   - Not fully.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.000]   - Wait, wait till you see those.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.400]   - So he's pulling out of his briefcase, some pixels.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   - These are pixel boards.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   - They're holding him in front of their eyes.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   - I'd always refer to your eyes in front of them.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.640]   (laughing)
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.800]   (speaking in French)
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.920]   (speaking in French)
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   - Oh no, no photos.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.120]   (speaking in French)
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.680]   - Stop taking pictures.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.680]   (speaking in French)
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.120]   - Here's our pixel board.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.400]   (laughing)
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.400]   (speaking in French)
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.840]   - He's your pastor.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.280]   (speaking in French)
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.360]   - That's the greatest one.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.440]   You don't play along with us,
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.760]   we're gonna discontinue your Google.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.600]   (laughing)
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.280]   - That's a man.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   By the way, I have a feeling these people are real.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.120]   These are not.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.120]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:10.960]   As far as I know.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.800]   - So they don't know.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.720]   This is not a,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.040]   I mean the photographers,
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.240]   the Google people are fake,
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.080]   but the.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.520]   - That's probably the whole joke.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.360]   - Right.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.200]   It's obviously a TV show.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.120]   Let's see what I wanna see is
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.240]   I wanna see the home view map now on Google.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.040]   They didn't do the last step there.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.640]   That would have been fun.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.120]   It's from the Huytah show.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.680]   - That seems in his room.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.720]   - That's very funny.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.360]   - And people believed it.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.760]   - Well, you know, the Google Street View car
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.280]   was sabotaged in Germany a week ago.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.840]   - Yeah, they really don't like it, do they?
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.800]   - Yeah, no, they don't.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   They go wacky on it.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.280]   - Santa, Street View doesn't bother me.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.120]   Does it's, I mean,
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:46.920]   it's public.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.160]   What's public is public.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.000]   - Right.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.360]   - If you restrict Google from taking pictures
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.920]   of people doing things in public,
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.800]   then you restrict journalists and citizens as well.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.920]   - Right.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.760]   Which many have tried to do.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.320]   - Yeah.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.640]   - In Germany.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.560]   - Now we were talking a little bit about HTML5.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.880]   And one of the remaining debates over HTML5
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.280]   is what video codec to use.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.840]   And this is actually a fairly important debate
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.240]   for open source advocates and people want an open internet
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   because the two choices seem to have come down to H.264,
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.680]   which is a very popular codec.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.680]   In fact, if you're watching our stream,
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.840]   it's in H.264.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.160]   In some cases, wrapped by flash, in some cases, not.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.240]   But it is an encumbered codec.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.160]   It's proprietary.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.600]   There are patents.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.120]   There's an alternative called Ogg Theora.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:41.240]   And I don't know if it's as good as H.264,
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.400]   but it is open.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.840]   - And not used as much.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.720]   - Hardly at all, as far as I can tell.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   - And Firefox won't support anything but Ogg Theora, correct?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.920]   - Yep.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:58.240]   Now apparently, and I'm reading,
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.400]   this is Google's open source blog,
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.320]   google-opensource.blogspot.com.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.520]   Google's written a little,
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.560]   there's a little post here,
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.520]   kind of putting some weight behind Ogg Theora.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.440]   And Google has given a grant.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.600]   They're funding Theora Arm,
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.320]   which is a free optimized for arm reversion of Theora.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.440]   And of course, that would be important for a lot
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.040]   of portable devices, including the iPad.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.480]   Hoping to, I think, get Theora
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.440]   a little bit farther along down the line.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.320]   I would love to see Google throw its weight
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.040]   beyond Theora.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.480]   - And then maybe people would actually use it.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.320]   - Yeah.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.480]   (laughs)
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.720]   - Yeah. - Interesting.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.560]   - We'd support it.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.280]   I mean, we're tied to the formats
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.400]   that our streaming providers offer.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.640]   It's been very interesting because every since Apple
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.040]   deprecated Flash, both Ustream and Justin.TV,
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.640]   two of our providers have started offering unwrapped,
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.320]   Flash-free versions of the video at H.264,
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.880]   which stream beautifully on the iPhone.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.520]   And if Android supported it,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.640]   would support stream lysogon.exes1.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   Does stream on the iPad.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.160]   And that's all happened just lately.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.560]   And I think because of Apple's stance against Flash,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.520]   I think Apple really is doing some damage to Flash.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.560]   But I would love, and now we would be thrilled
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.360]   if we had a Theora version of our stream.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.760]   But that requires, we can't do it.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.840]   We don't have the resources to do it.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.760]   That requires our providers doing it.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.120]   Moving along, YouTube's testing a new video player.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.040]   This is, I guess, part of their redesign.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.520]   A video player with more elegant controls.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.420]   - So say that.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.600]   - So,
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.640]   actually the video I just played had those new controls.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.680]   I was a little puzzled by it.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.520]   - Yeah, I noticed that.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.360]   I was like, what is that?
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.200]   - What is that?
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.040]   (laughing)
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.280]   - It's a different thing than usual.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.400]   - Yeah.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.640]   And they're dimmed out a little bit too.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.280]   - So, I don't know, I'm just, again,
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.920]   I don't know if it's a big deal.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.440]   - The other video thing from Google is the Google video now
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.920]   when you search for a show like Seinfeld,
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.760]   it gives you the opportunity to get just episodes
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.600]   from each year.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.760]   But interestingly, you do not have the option to play there.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.040]   You must go off.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.360]   - Hmm.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.680]   Go off to, like, who do you--
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.960]   - You would ever cite the videos from.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.800]   So it's merely a search engine.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.040]   - Well, that's fine. - There's not
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:26.880]   a video there.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.240]   - It's an open web, my friend.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.080]   - Yes, good.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:29.920]   - That's a good thing, yeah.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.120]   - Yeah, I'm a lawyer too.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.440]   - In fact, that's one issue, you know,
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.000]   sometimes I worry that Google gives some sort of precedence
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   to YouTube video versus video store on other sites.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.160]   And I don't know if it's the case or not,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.000]   but I have to say it definitely prejudices us
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.180]   towards storing our stuff on YouTube.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:49.200]   It wasn't enough to get us to use Google video, however.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.040]   (laughing)
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.240]   It does help that there's a community there.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.160]   But that's the way that Google could perhaps
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.680]   skew things a little bit.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:07.920]   Anything else of interest before we get to our tips and tools?
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.600]   - I returned my Nexus One this week.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.720]   - What?
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   - I swapped it, actually.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   I didn't return it.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.560]   I was really sad.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.400]   I was really sad.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400]   I looked down on a couple of weeks ago
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.720]   and I saw like these little specks of dust.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.320]   In fact, I don't know if we're gonna be able to see it.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.720]   - Oh, you know, the dust issues start to crop up.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.040]   - Under the screen, yeah.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.080]   I was so sad.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.520]   I mean, I was just like crushed.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.120]   I was cradling the handset in my,
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.520]   I was like rubbing it against my jeans.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.720]   Like, is it on the outside?
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.080]   No, it's in the inside.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.960]   But I called, I called Google support.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.320]   They connected me to HTC.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.640]   I said, I have dust under the screen.
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.520]   It's a production.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.240]   It's an unsealed, you know, the foam seal
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.640]   isn't correct.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.480]   Actually, Leo, you probably know more about this.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.760]   But it's a production mistake.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.280]   They connected me to HTC and they said,
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.120]   okay, we're gonna put a $530 hold on your credit card
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.440]   and send you a new phone without us.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440]   - Wow.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.360]   - If you send your phone back to us within 10 days,
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.520]   we release the hold and we don't charge you.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.600]   - They swapped it.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.440]   - They swapped it, yeah.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.400]   And the other option was that I could send them my phone
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.440]   and then be phoneless for like two weeks
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.840]   while they sent me another phone.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.880]   So I opted for the hold because they're not actually,
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.720]   they're not gonna charge me.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.560]   I'm gonna send it back.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.680]   But it was really, really simple.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.320]   So if you've dust on your Nexus One screen,
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.160]   just call it.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.000]   - What did it look like?
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.160]   'Cause after I saw your post, I went,
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.640]   well, where is, is there dust?
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.480]   I don't know.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.160]   It's apparent, it's obvious.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.000]   - It's, yeah.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.120]   If you look really closely,
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.200]   there's just tiny little specs under the screen itself.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.400]   I don't think.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   - People have, I've gotten complaints about that
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.320]   with the iPad as well.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.400]   I think it's in the nature of capacitance screens
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.680]   in the glass on top of them.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.520]   - When I open up the back of my Nexus One,
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.760]   it has tons of dust in it that I can't figure out
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.320]   where it got there.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.160]   - Oh, weird.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.400]   - Dust is everywhere.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.920]   - No, I mean, it's like, it's dust,
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.200]   it's specs that you can't rub off.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.840]   It's specs that are obviously trapped underneath.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.840]   And apparently, this is an iPhone thing too.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.560]   You can return your iPhone if it happens to your iPhone
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.600]   and they'll swap it out for you.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.720]   Apple will swap it as well.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.480]   - Well, this is good news 'cause Google's been getting
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.320]   a lot of heat for their bad support for the Nexus One.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.480]   Their Python-based support.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.000]   - Yeah, the Python answered out, "Py."
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.360]   No, no, no, it was a live human who picked up the phone
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.320]   instantly and can't communicate to you.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.600]   It was really pretty painless.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.440]   - That's awesome.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.120]   - When I almost returned mine,
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.560]   I had the same experience that they were very responsive,
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.760]   very good, trying to convince me not to,
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.400]   which they should do, but not in an AOL way.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.360]   And yeah, so far, the only time I've tried to do anything,
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.480]   I didn't end up doing it that time.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.920]   - Yeah, I mean, they asked me how I like the phone.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.520]   I mean, the great thing is you take out the battery,
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.280]   you take out the SIM card, and I know when I boot up
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.840]   my new phone, which I have, I actually haven't started yet,
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.520]   all my Android settings are stored in the cloud.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.360]   - I love that.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.720]   - The phone will just sign in and everything will be
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.040]   just as it was, all my, I'm not sure actually apps,
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.000]   but certainly my wallpaper and hot contacts.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.840]   - It was stores apps.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.800]   - There's stores apps in which,
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.640]   - Yes.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.480]   - I'm very excited about that.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.600]   So then I just dropped the other one,
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.840]   you know, I'm gonna sign out of the one with the dusty one
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.800]   and drop it in the box and I'm done, so.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.160]   - That reminds me a question.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.440]   - So I did an interview this week for AARP magazine,
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.120]   no cracks please, about the iPad.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.760]   And the reporter said, you know,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.680]   this is being talked about as grandma's computer,
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.840]   which I think insults grandma,
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.160]   grandma's been on land for 15 years,
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.240]   but anyway, he said, don't you have to own a PC
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.200]   or a Mac to sync two iTunes?
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.640]   - Yes, it's a peripheral.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.760]   - It's very problematic.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   - Yes.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.320]   - And the Nexus one, or Android in general, I mean listen,
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.960]   the iPhone and the iPad does things,
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.360]   a lot things better than Android does,
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.800]   but the one thing that Android does very, very well,
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.680]   is just this idea like sign in once,
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.880]   all your stuff's on your device instantly.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.960]   - All on the cloud.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.320]   - Yep, no syncing.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.520]   - When I moved from the droid to the Nexus one,
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.200]   I was shocked 'cause it was instantly had my wallpaper,
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.560]   all the applications started downloading.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.540]   It was amazing.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.440]   - That's one thing I will do is if I can get my hands
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.200]   on the iPad and stick them in and do it there, right?
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.120]   It should just sync it basically, right?
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.120]   - It should, it should, yeah.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.440]   If you sign in with the right, the same Google account, yeah.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.120]   - Right, yeah, isn't that neat?
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   - Oh God, now I gotta remember which Google account I use.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.720]   (laughing)
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.800]   - That's another problem.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.960]   Here's one kind of cool story,
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.280]   just kind of a last story.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   Google Earth helps unearth new human species in South Africa.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.560]   Paleoanthropologists, Professor Lee Berger
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.280]   at the University of Vittvossestrant in Johannesburg,
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.160]   used Google Earth over the last two years
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.160]   to locate more than 500 previously undiscovered
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.080]   caves and fossil sites.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.040]   Wow, based on--
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.480]   - That's really cool how I guess you can just see
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.880]   the indentations and things.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.080]   This was a very well-disgulled, well-explored area,
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.960]   even so, they found pater.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.640]   - And a new human species, Australopithecus sediba,
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.480]   an upright walker that shared many physical traits
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.200]   with the earliest known species of the genus Homo.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   - Who should be known as Homo Googles.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.040]   - I hope they do.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.200]   - Just in the right world.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   (laughing)
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.360]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:03.640]   And they've added some new features to Google Earth.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.280]   I think it's Google Earth Oceans, which I think is,
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.160]   they added outer space and now inner space.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.600]   Google has added layers of information
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.040]   and annotations for all the oceans.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.080]   So if you've got Google Earth, you can start to look
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.440]   and see more about the oceans.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.960]   Last year, I didn't know this.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.680]   All the oceans were 3D mapped
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.320]   and video and photos were added for good measure.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.560]   Now they're adding the information as well.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.840]   - Wow, so like there are Google's ocean submarines
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.720]   equipped with cameras?
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.560]   - Yes.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.400]   - Going out.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.720]   - Robots.txt.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.400]   - What's it like to do?
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.240]   - Sort out.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.000]   - There's some coral reefs that have a robots.txt file.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.040]   (laughing)
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.480]   - It's prohibiting entry.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.320]   - It's actually--
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.240]   - I envision flipper with something on his head now.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.480]   (laughing)
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.720]   - I represent Google Ocean.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.760]   I think it's really great.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.040]   - Really great.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:57.880]   - Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   That's really cool. - Yeah.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.040]   - Homo Googles.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.200]   That would make-- - Homo Googles.
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.800]   - Homo's everywhere happy.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.520]   (laughing)
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.200]   - Hey baby, we're all homos.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.520]   (laughing)
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.360]   - We are.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.200]   - We're all homos.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.640]   - Let's move on.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.200]   Tip, tool, and number starting with Gina Trapani's
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.320]   Tip of the Week.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.560]   - My tip this week is a shameless Android plug.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.720]   This is for folks who have been thinking about switching
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.920]   to Android but aren't sure whether or not they want to
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.480]   'cause they don't know what apps are available.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.720]   I had a listener write me an email saying,
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.880]   "Hey, I've got this iPhone and my nine year old
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.640]   "has just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.680]   "And we're gonna use a smartphone to kind of keep records
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.200]   "and keep on top of the physicalness.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.720]   "And I'm thinking about switching to Android
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.880]   "but I don't know if Android has any diabetes related apps
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.040]   "because I need a handset to actually search the market."
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.520]   There are a few featured apps on the site
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.200]   but no apps that you can't search the market on the web.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.280]   But you actually can.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.440]   There's a site called @DoubleTwist.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.120]   DoubleTwist is a great media manager.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.120]   You can sync with Android device.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.200]   - I use it, I love it.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.400]   - Yeah, yeah, me too.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.800]   A little slow but I like it.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.760]   - Hey, what's-- - If you go to apps.doubletwist.com,
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.400]   it's a web front end to search the Android market.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.200]   So you can check out what apps are available.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.320]   I mean, you basically get the information
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.800]   that you would get if you were looking
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.080]   at the Android market reviews and ratings
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   but everything's there.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.920]   So if you're wondering if Android has an app similar
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.240]   to something you're running on the iPhone
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.640]   or some other system, you can search there.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.280]   So apps.doubletwist.com.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.660]   - That is really great.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.800]   Thanks to a DVD John
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.120]   'cause that's his company, DoubleTwist.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.440]   - Oh. - Yeah.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.280]   - I didn't realize that.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.760]   - Yeah, the guy who cracked CSS.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.800]   - Thanks, DVD John. - Thanks DVD John.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.920]   Once again.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   - Right on.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.320]   - He's a pretty cool guy.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.240]   - Yeah, nice, I didn't know that.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.880]   - So you search for Twitter, there's 1,222 results for Twitter.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.760]   - I have-- - But none of them say
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.120]   the Twitter app.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.880]   - None of them say the Twitter app.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.400]   - And we come full circle.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.440]   - Actually, there is an entry that just says Twitter
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.920]   but the bird is looking kind of janky.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.680]   - Yeah, it's clearly not.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.520]   - It's clearly not me.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.280]   - That's right, fake bird, yes.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.720]   - And the first review is what a piece of crap.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.120]   (laughing)
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.960]   - I have to say there's one thing that is true
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.200]   about the Android marketplace is they're not all great apps.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.120]   - Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.440]   - Let a million crappy apps bloom.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.920]   - Right. (laughing)
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.120]   - I don't think that is Jeff's number.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.760]   - But what it is, it is.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.280]   It leads directly to the number layer.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.240]   Like you planned it this way.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.720]   - I kind of did.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.560]   - Okay.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.400]   - I knew what your number was.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.760]   - Oh, there's a silly number you could find.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.000]   - I stayed away from it.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   - We're nice up stay away.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.280]   All right, more than 9,000 Android apps were added in March.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.720]   (whistling)
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.200]   That's just sort of double the 5,500 in February.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.320]   So nice big upswing here, actually 9,308 in March.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.960]   And the total, which is what I'm interested in
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.440]   is the 42,000 downloadable apps.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.560]   That's 100,000 shy of Apple's 140,000.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.280]   And of course, some of the Android ones are crappy.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.320]   But there's growth here.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.080]   So if you go back to June of 2008,
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.360]   there were 6,000 apps for that.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.600]   That's surprising then.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.960]   Finally, the numbers here, according to endrolib.com
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.920]   are that 59.6% of Android applications are free
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.720]   versus 27% of iPhone applications are free.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.200]   - Huh.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.280]   That's interesting.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.920]   - So the thing, the number I don't have
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.000]   that I really wanna have is what's the installed base
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.440]   of the two OSS now?
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.600]   Of customers in the green.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.440]   - That's a good question.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.840]   - I can't find it anywhere.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.600]   So is chat room, chat room a low chat room?
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.520]   - No, I can give you the number for the iPod touch
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.040]   and the iPhone, 'cause Steve quoted it on Thursday,
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.880]   was I think the 85 million.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.560]   I doubt very much there's 85 million Android.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.760]   - Yeah, Andrew's got a way to go.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.160]   - I can pretty much assure you it's not close.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.080]   - And that's great that there are more Android apps.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.200]   I mean, of course, it's not, you don't care about quantity
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.560]   as much as you care about quality,
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.800]   but I think the quantity sort of leads to quality.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.320]   For apps to just really start to distinguish themselves
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.400]   and get really good.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.320]   So those are great growth numbers.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.680]   - That by the way is an issue,
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.400]   if you're gonna do an Android tablet,
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.840]   one of the things that's really succeeded on the iPad
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.360]   is these native iPad apps, which are,
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.640]   I mean, it's a big difference between doubling an app
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.120]   and actually making an app for this screen size.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.680]   And I don't know if you're gonna see Android developers
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.640]   step up in the same way.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.160]   - Yeah.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.440]   - Yeah, it'll be interesting to see,
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.680]   'cause with all that extra real estate,
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.680]   you really can do a lot more.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.560]   - Makes a big difference.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.800]   I mean, when I look at what Zagata's done or Zillow has done,
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.760]   and these are free upgrades, most of them are not,
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.560]   but it really makes a big difference.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.680]   - I use Tweet Deck, I love Tweet Deck on the desktop,
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.360]   and I imagine on the iPad, it's excellent.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.600]   - It's similar to the desktop.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.000]   They finally have the room that's called.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.280]   - Yeah, you have in a room to do more columns, right?
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.440]   - Yeah, it's very similar.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.240]   It looks exactly like the desktop app.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.040]   But then there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.280]   My tip of the week comes from our good friend Matt Cutz,
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.160]   and it's a little trick using Google's URL, Shortener,
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.400]   goo.gl.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.400]   If you append.qr
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.840]   after the goo.gl URL,
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.840]   you do goo.gl.qr, you will get a QR code.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.880]   It will generate one of those 2D barcodes,
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.840]   which is kind of wild.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.320]   Now, the real problem is,
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.560]   how do you use Google's URL Shortener?
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.960]   And there are not many ways to do it.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.600]   - You have to know where the bookmarklet is
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.880]   or run the toolbar, right?
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.080]   - Yeah, if you use Chrome,
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.160]   there's a Chrome extension that does it.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.960]   Still, I think it's kind of cool.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.480]   Apparently, though, not so difficult to generate QR codes.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.480]   And in fact, there's a lot of different ways to do this.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.400]   Here's one from, a reader added to my friend feed poster,
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.600]   Matt's friend feed post, snapmyinfo.com/qr
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.480]   will do the same thing.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.720]   In fact, you can take any arbitrary text
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.200]   and make a QR code.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.800]   Maximum 512 characters.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.360]   Now is the time for all good homos
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:22.360]   to come to the aid of their country.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.320]   This would be good to just put this on your,
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.160]   URL,
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.240]   wonder how fast it is.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.600]   So there you go.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.760]   A QR code, just for you.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.480]   And of course, you can scan that in
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.200]   with your Droid phone.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.520]   Which, would you use a particular app,
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.240]   either of you for your Nexus One
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.640]   to read QR codes and other codes?
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.480]   - It's called Barcode Scanner.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.800]   - I don't have the opportunity to do it.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.000]   - Barcode Scanner, I think it comes,
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:49.840]   does it come with it?
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.680]   I think it does.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.840]   - No, I think I installed Barcode Scanner.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.840]   - I can't remember.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.320]   - It's easy to get.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.720]   You could search Double Twist and find it.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.840]   - Yeah, yep.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.760]   - Gina Trapani is the author of
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.960]   The Complete Guide to Google Wave.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.520]   Any new wave stuff going on?
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.920]   - Some new, let's see,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.320]   what was the last wave thing that happened?
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.960]   Oh, just the April Fool's prank about the notifications.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.080]   Otherwise, not too much.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.440]   Although I get the feeling that they're gearing up
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.720]   to launch some wave related stuff at Google I/O
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.560]   next month.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.400]   - They're due.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.240]   - Yes, they are due.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.080]   - We were talking before the show,
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:29.920]   you're going to Google I/O.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.520]   Are you gonna go Jeff to Google I/O?
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.360]   - Nope.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.560]   'Cause I'm not, I'm a pretend, I'm fake.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.200]   I can't develop crap.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.640]   - Well, I'll inquire, but I wonder
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   if we could cover it in some way.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.480]   - Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.440]   Well, I'll be there, so I'd be happy to.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.280]   - Yeah.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   - Help out with that, however I can.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   I mean, of course I'd love to have you there
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.880]   in the flesh, Leo, but if you're not,
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.200]   I'd be happy to do some coverage.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.080]   - I'm gonna look into that
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.200]   and see if we can bring our patented camera staff.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.040]   - Ooh, that'd be awesome.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   - And go around and cover Google I/O.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.000]   - Yeah, I think it's gonna be fun.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   - Yeah, the folks at Ustream have said,
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.080]   anytime you wanna borrow the live Ustreamer Live Ustreamer
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.680]   - The live staff, the streaming staff.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.120]   - The live magic staff.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:09.960]   - Yes.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.800]   - Get off staff.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.880]   You can read the book and buy your very own copy online
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.680]   at completewaveguide.com.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.880]   And of course, Gina's blog is a must read.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.080]   Put it in your news reader
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.480]   if you don't wanna go to the site every single day.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.440]   - Even when she's bored by the discussion of the iPad,
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.120]   she's fascinating for me.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.320]   - Wow, I'm impressed.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.400]   Your filter's a good Leo.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.560]   I didn't think you'd catch that.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.360]   - Oh, I catch it all.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.600]   I see everywhere.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.480]   It's smarterware.org.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.680]   - And follow White House this week on Twitter
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.960]   and answer the question,
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.920]   what should we do when it comes out this week?
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.480]   - If you have an opinion.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.440]   - If you have an opinion.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.280]   - Don't just make up some--
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.360]   - That never stopped anybody online.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.640]   - I know.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.160]   What is it, George Burns said is too bad.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.360]   All the people know how to run the country
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.080]   or drive in cabs and cutting hair.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.120]   Jeff Jarvis is the man at buzzmachine.com
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.440]   and the author of,
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.640]   - What would Google do?
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.800]   - And your new book is out.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.880]   Are you right in now or you weren't--
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.800]   - Oh, I got one page in.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.120]   I think I'm gonna change.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.560]   The talk I'm giving in Germany,
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.320]   I'm thinking I'm trying to convince my editor
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.240]   that's the topic.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.040]   - He's reboxing his book.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:17.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.040]   - So from our beta?
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:19.920]   Wait, I was--
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.400]   - That's called beta, yes.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.240]   - But it's still beta.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.080]   - Okay, okay.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.040]   - I love the name.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:24.880]   - I love the name.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.280]   I love the whole idea.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.640]   - The beauty of the name is you can make it anything you want.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.800]   - It's true.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.160]   - You can make it about Aquaria.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.120]   - That's just the problem.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:33.960]   I'll see.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.840]   I'm gonna see I got some plain time and some Google time.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.640]   I'm gonna sit in the sauna and think in Germany.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.000]   - Yeah.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.520]   - But you'll catch Jeff at buzzmachine.com
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.240]   and what would Google do is the book available on Amazon
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.760]   and everywhere else as well.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.040]   - For those German listeners,
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.440]   I'll be speaking at Republica in Berlin on Wednesday
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.120]   about the German paradox about publicness and privacy.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.760]   - Will you be back?
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.400]   - I'll be back, yes.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.800]   - In time for next week's episode.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.640]   - Yes.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.800]   - And you must be exhausted.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.040]   That's a lot--
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.120]   - Driving to Rochester and back last night was exhausting.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.400]   - That's bad.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.800]   Yeah, I'm about to do the college trips myself.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.200]   All right, Jeff, Gina.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.000]   We'll see y'all later.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:13.840]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840]   Don't forget you can watch this show.

[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.480]   Oh, we're--
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.920]   I wanna talk to you too about moving it to another day.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.280]   So don't hang up right after the show
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.240]   'cause I would like to talk about that.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.040]   But right now, at least for now,
