[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.620]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham are here and we have a full agenda, a full slate of fabulous things to talk about.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.120]   Almost too many to mention.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:23.280]   Disney trying to acquire at a last ditch attempt, the 21st Century Fox movie studio and some TV content.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.000]   The future of broadcasting, maybe it's on Instagram, maybe it's a scam.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.520]   And gaming.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.000]   E-Sports is about to explode.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.800]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   From people you trust.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.960]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.440]   This is Twig.

[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.720]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.120]   This is Twig.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.480]   This week in Google, episode 462, recorded Wednesday, June 20th, 2018.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.760]   The people formerly known as the audience.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.520]   This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.320]   Home plays a huge role in your life.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.960]   That's why Quick and Loans created Rocket Mortgage.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.680]   It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully so you can be confident.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   You're getting the right mortgage for you.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   Get started at Rocket Mortgage.com/Twig.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.520]   It's time for this week in Google, the show where we talk about the latest news from the
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.960]   Google verse with Stacey Higginbotham of Stacey on I-O-T.com.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.320]   She's @kigastacey on Twitter.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   Hi Stacey.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.400]   Hello Leo and Jeff.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.080]   And there may be some exclamations at some point during the show because you're waiting
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080]   for the birth of a child.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   Yes, not my child to be clear, my nephew, but always a good time.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   No one has ever.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   I wish they would.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.720]   Attempted to give birth during a show.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.120]   Nope, nope.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.960]   That does not sound like any fun whatsoever.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.320]   Having given birth to a child?
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.080]   You're gonna say no.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.520]   Not worthy of podcasts.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   Nope.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.120]   A little too real I think.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   Look, it's getting real.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.520]   It's getting real in here.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.480]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.000]   He is Professor of Journalism.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.560]   What's the full title?
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   Attempted.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.480]   I am the Leonard Tal Professor of Journalism Innovation at the Craig Doo Mark Graduate
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.440]   School of Journalism at the City University of New York and Director of the Tal Knights
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.080]   Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.280]   I only got as far as living Tal.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.480]   He's definitely getting faster and smoother.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   He's really good.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000]   Get that in a lower third.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.080]   We're working on it.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.680]   We had to get our animation department to work together to make it move.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   It'll have to scroll.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.160]   The Leonard Tal Professor for Journalism Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.800]   at the City University of New York.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.280]   Jeff Jarvis, I give you the Director of the Tal Knights Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.720]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   Graduate School of Journalism at Kelly.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   The City of Virginia.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   Yes.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   He's our man.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.440]   Jeff's our man.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.760]   If he can't do it, no one can.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.200]   But Instagram have an event this morning.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.000]   That's the weirdest thing ever.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.720]   Instagram had an event, started two hours late.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   No.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.120]   It wasn't two hours.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   Was it?
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.920]   I just thought it was like a little bit late.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.120]   New York Times sent six reporters.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.040]   Dear Lord, are you serious?
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.680]   Well, it's either four or six.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.840]   And they made a couple of announcements.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.240]   One, a billion users, one billion monthly active users or mouse.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.200]   One billion monthly active users.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.280]   And the other is this new thing called IGTV, a long form as long as an hour.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.520]   Guess it's a competitor to YouTube video platform that is proudly vertical.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.280]   But I can't get it yet.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.480]   It's going to come out over the next few weeks.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.880]   I was going to say maybe you're too old.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.800]   Yeah, I don't get it, man.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.160]   I will one find it.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.680]   It will be available on iOS and Android.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   So it's a separate app.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   It's a separate app.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   It's a separate app.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   IGTV.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   Oh, are you still?
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.280]   Do you need to sign up for it?
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.800]   Are you linked to it via your Instagram account?
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040]   I suspect it's through your Instagram account.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   I would hope so.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.240]   The new platform is for content creators.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.640]   Anybody know any content creators?
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.960]   It makes Instagram a direct competitor with YouTube and Facebook, I guess.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.480]   And I guess we should say traditional media.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.920]   I just fell on the dollar right now.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920]   Oh, you got it.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   Well, that one.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   It was not the first IGTV.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   It was like the fifth.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   Oh, I see.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   So all right.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.080]   I haven't checked since a little while ago, so they must it's gone up good.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.600]   I'm the Android store.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.960]   Yeah, I'm looking on the Android.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.720]   IGTV is kind of like IPTV.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   Get it?
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.440]   Here's the first person I see your competitor.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   Who's my competitor?
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   I don't even know if I have a competitor.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.880]   Marcus Brown, like of course he'd be on there with me.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.440]   Oh, yeah, it is on Android now.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   Yep.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.480]   So did he just come up?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   He was the first one.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   There's others.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   Of course the world is a role.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.320]   Is it people you're following?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   Oh, it's carousel.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   No, it's Kim Kardashian.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.520]   I don't follow Kim Kardashian.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   Okay.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.680]   It's okay, Jeff.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.920]   We know you're a secret.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   He finds you.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   Nah.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   Welcome to IGTV yet.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   You're like five Trevor Nohars.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.000]   You're the onboarding.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.200]   It knows because I have Instagram on this phone.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   Welcome.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   Continue as Mr. Laport.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   That's me.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Yes, sir.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.600]   I have two factor on this.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   Hold on.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.040]   That's like the story of my life.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   Two factor.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.760]   Oh, I love two factor.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   It's better for me.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   I love it.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.240]   I love it.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.120]   I am two factor everywhere because it's better.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.520]   Oh, I like the whites.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.120]   I got snow at first.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   Do you think?
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.920]   Dingo pups are the cutest.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.320]   Do you think the kids will know what that snow is?
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   Oh, they are.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   They're very cute.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.320]   Very cool.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   They go pups.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   Thank you.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   So here's the Instagram announcement.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.800]   It's 17 minutes and 20 seconds.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   That's on there.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.880]   Kevin's system announcing IGTV.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.600]   A lot of big balloons.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.640]   It's vertical, but it's not aggressively vertical.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.240]   It doesn't fill the whole screen.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   No, it's more.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.080]   Well, no, if you get rid of the carousel, it's full.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.680]   So let me create a channel.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.920]   Oh, oh, so it's just swipe down the carousel.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   Yeah, it's bold.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   With videos longer than a minute, you can do more.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.440]   I don't know how I end up with this.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.640]   I built for full screen vertical video, so it's meant to watch on mobile.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   So should I create a channel?
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.520]   Yeah, we should make something right now.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   Yes.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   View your channel.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.200]   It's the Mr.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.920]   It's the Mr.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   La Porte.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   La Porte channel.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   So upload.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.240]   Oh, you can't do it live.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   Create channel.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.680]   I don't know what I'm watching.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.440]   I think this is the announcement.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.720]   Upload video, allow it.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.240]   No videos found.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.120]   So you don't-- gosh, you'd think they'd have live.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   Am I missing something?
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.400]   I guess I am.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.800]   I'm not.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.160]   So you upload videos.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.440]   Yep, there's beauty tips with Kim Kardashian.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   OK, so it's probably more than it's more like YouTube.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.480]   I know YouTube has live, but most people do their videos and then upload them.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.240]   Here's a robot dancing.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.680]   This is the announcement.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.720]   So this is probably why it was two hours late.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   They had a lot of--
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.800]   They're still working on it.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Set up.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.280]   There's a lot of dancing.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.560]   And these are all creators, right?
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.600]   Lauren, Laura, DIY is going to make a--
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   she's going to-- it looks like she's going to do some bedazzling, some strip bedazzling.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.480]   Somebody, unfortunately, I guess she can't afford jeans because they're all-- they're
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   all ripped up.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   Um, Leo.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480]   Come on.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   Come on.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.640]   I am an old man.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.600]   Now they're dancing down a hall.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.680]   Looks somewhat like a brothel.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.760]   And then this is very-- this, you know, reminds me so much of the YouTube year-ender videos,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.640]   right, where they go quick cuts.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   Oh.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   Creator to creator.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.160]   Sorry, a star is born official trailer from Lady Gaga.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.320]   Yeah, she's going to-- she's doing a star is born.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   You see meow?
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   So that's probably the monetization strategy, right?
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.760]   If you could do this, you could do ads.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.760]   Right.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   Do you--
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.480]   Yeah, I find Instagram stories a little annoying.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.800]   I noticed neither of you do Instagram stories, but everybody--
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   No, I don't either.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Do people watch those?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.080]   Do the stories format is taking over the world.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.240]   They're taking over the world.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.600]   Yeah, I feel kind of old.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.560]   But you know, I used to make vines, but I don't do stories and I think I'm just tired
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   and old.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   That's my excuse.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   I'm tired and old.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.840]   But, and Jeff, I was going to ask you about this.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.720]   This actually relates a little bit to this.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.120]   I was reading whatever version of the New Yorker I'm on, which is way late, but they
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.120]   did a whole thing on--
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.560]   The Dilt machine, the New Yorker.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   Just piles of guilt.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   Yes.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   That's why you got to get texture, right?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.920]   So you can-- won't pile.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   It's just like--
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.560]   They had a-- it's a scam, SKAM.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.560]   Austin, they did a big story on it, and it was a Norwegian television show for teens
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.840]   made by like the Norwegian club at Brostice.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   Yes.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.640]   And it looked so fascinating.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   It is.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.880]   I saw-- I went to a conference.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.240]   God, I go to so many conferences.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   Where was it?
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.320]   I went to a conference where I met-- I followed her on stage.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   The creators.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   Julie Adlin.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   It's cool.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   It's cool.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   You know what's funny?
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   We've seen this before.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.320]   This was-- what was it?
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.360]   Lonely Kid 24.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.000]   What was it?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.320]   Oh, no.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.800]   This is different because it is very similar, but it is--
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   It is unscripted.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   There was even a book.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   It is scripted.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.560]   Remember the books of the love letters?
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   Lonely Girl.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.080]   Yeah, Lonely Girl 16 or 16.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   Lonely Girl 15.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   Lonely Girl 15.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.080]   Lonely Girl 15.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.040]   We saw a lot of attempts to create episodic content that looked like it was so similar.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   This is wildly popular.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.360]   What's which darn conference was?
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   Norwegian.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   Oh, I think.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   I see where which country.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.760]   So is she off?
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.160]   Is it just on Facebook?
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   Where is it?
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   No.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.160]   So this is what's really exciting.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.440]   So let's give people context.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.160]   So Lonely Girl was August-- or was 2006 to 2008.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.600]   This pretended to be a vlog back when vlogs were a YouTube diary of a teenager.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.480]   Very early YouTube things.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.480]   Super early.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.000]   Now, this is actually a scripted television show that is creates-- they create little
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.920]   one to eight minute snippets.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.120]   They post them on Facebook watch.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.680]   It's part of the Facebook watch program, which is Facebook's TV effort.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.720]   And they appear in people's timelines like they're like your friends.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.440]   You know, and these drama is happening at a Austin high school.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.840]   But then the characters all have Instagram and Twitter profiles.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.720]   And they go back like years.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.840]   So you can actually like cyber stock these people and find out like, oh, they used to
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.520]   be friends, but now they're not.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:35.240]   So it's really-- and it's the film and the script in response to audience like participation.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   So it's a very new way of--
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.520]   So where you would consume it is by going to different--
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.800]   It just pops up in your Facebook feed.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.160]   And then it gets better if you take the action as a user and go find out information about
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   people.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.360]   So if you're curious, you go like look up the characters on Instagram.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.560]   So you'd have to follow scam on Facebook and Instagram because you'd get messages in both
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560]   places.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   Yes.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.760]   The New Yorker writes, as with all internet products, once you establish a connection
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.720]   to scam, it's very hard to sever it.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.600]   Facebook and Instagram send viewers constant reminders to log back in and stay up to date.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.480]   Happy Taffy just posted a video.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.280]   scam Austin just posted a new episode on Facebook watch.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.520]   Yeah, of course, notifications, right?
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.200]   I know where I saw her.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   A fake.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Yes, because--
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.880]   Oh, yeah, because this is all Facebook.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.880]   It's all Facebook.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.880]   Ingo, right.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   Right.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.480]   So they interviewed her.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.960]   I can understand why I created, be very interested in this as a new way of creating content.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   Absolutely.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.760]   It's a different relationship with the people formerly known as the audience.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.520]   But it's a lot of work for the audience.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.520]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.880]   So the goal of this show was to appeal to teen girls.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.160]   And that's what happened in Norway.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   Was it a success?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   Oh, huge success.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   Like 98% of--
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.080]   This is a country where a train traveling for eight hours with a camera on top.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   He's also a success.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.560]   So let's just-- it's cold there.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.880]   Let's just make this clear.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   But we love Norway.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   But--
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.440]   What was the stat that you're about to give us?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   I think it was like 98% of the population, the teen population had heard of it.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.920]   And I mean, just ridiculous.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.720]   I don't know how many watched it or what.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   Well, get ready because the creator of American idols, Simon Fuller, has bought the English
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.760]   language rights.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   So that's what we're talking about.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.120]   It's already on-- it's already on.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   It's in.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.840]   It's scam Austin is the version that we're talking about.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   That's his story.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.680]   So Simon Fuller doing this.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.680]   Uh-huh.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.680]   Yes.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.680]   Oh, it is.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Oh.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   Oh.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.520]   Another creator who is-- you know, I mean, he was one of the pioneers of reality-based
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   TV.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.760]   But this is how my daughter watches-- this is how my daughter entertains herself.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.280]   She watches tiny little snippets on YouTube, but then she also has-- we'll call them characters
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   that she follows.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.680]   She is 11, going on 12.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:59.880]   But she follows them for their videos on YouTube, and then she'll go find them on Instagram
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.920]   and find them other places.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.800]   And-- It's not aimed at anybody older than-- I mean, it's really aimed at the high school
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   age or earlier.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   Yes.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   You know, in fact, '17 magazine was never aimed at 17-year-olds.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.600]   It was aimed at 12-year-olds who were just figuring out how to be a 17-year-old.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   This is actually aimed at older students because there's like sexual content and stuff like
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   that.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.880]   Not like crazy pornography stuff, but my 12-year-old would be a little--
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.400]   Too old for her, maybe.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.800]   Too young for-- or she's too young for-- yes, it is too old for her.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.760]   Actually, the New Yorker article also mentions Lonely Girl 15.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.840]   Of course they-- And remember, Big Brother, the house where roommates are conspiring, that
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   was an early attempt to do this.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   The-- Still big in Europe.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.000]   The treatment I gave NBC when we created the site on MSNBC was that it was a big-- this
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   was before Big Brother.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.880]   It was a-- because this was in 1992.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.760]   It was a big Victorian where web developers lived, loved, and fought, and they created
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.120]   a website, which ended up being the TV show at the end of the day.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.000]   But you could tune in throughout the day on the web.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.240]   I wish NBC had bought this.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.760]   I'd be a rich man by now.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.400]   You could tune in different times on the web, see what different people were doing,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.160]   who was fighting with whom.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.800]   This was 1992, I thought of this.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.120]   You could listen to their playlists.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.400]   If you had-- they were listening to music, like Kevin Rose.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.800]   He had a certain style of music.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.720]   You would want to listen to his music.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.280]   This was-- we pitched this.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.920]   NBC loved the pitch, but they never made the show, unfortunately.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.080]   Let's be new.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.400]   I wish they'd gone for it.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   I said somewhere.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.840]   That's with 95 page treatment, I should find it.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.640]   But that's what the site-- it became, but they didn't want to do all the-- and it was
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.600]   probably too early for the web to do all that stuff.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   The text on--
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.880]   I just put up the site launched in '94.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.520]   So the web really wasn't widespread enough by then.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.680]   Now's the time, though.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   Boy.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.800]   Yeah, so something like this.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:00.440]   Now thinking about the IGTV announcement in context with reading about that and thinking
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:08.480]   about how my daughter watches television, it feels like we always talk about it undergoing
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   a shift.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.200]   It's an interesting way to think about how that shift, what the end product might look
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.880]   like, I guess.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.800]   So now I'm like, mmm.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:24.000]   But you put up an interview with the creator in the chat on the rundown.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   The Norwegian creator.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.680]   Yeah, and she's very-- kind of Norwegian stern.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.840]   It's very interesting.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.680]   But you can fast forward through to get some sense of how they--
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.600]   Well, the difference is the version she made was public television.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   Yes.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   So it was--
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Yes.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   You know, this was--
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   It wasn't healthy.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.800]   Well, in the long run, it was healthy, right?
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.840]   Well, it was Norwegian healthy.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.800]   It was-- I think that's an important distinction.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.320]   Well, let me read what the New Yorker says.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.800]   "True to its roots in public television scam attempts to educate its audience and its primary
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   theme that is, if you keep trying, things will come out all right in the end.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.040]   For instance, in the Norwegian version, the girl who is slut-shamed for kissing someone
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.960]   else's boyfriend faces down her tormentors, a young man who attempts to suppress his
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.320]   homosexuality winds up accepting himself.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.600]   But there is apparently debate about what's going to happen in scam Austin.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.800]   So scam Austin has not started yet or it's about-- has started a little bit?
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600]   No, they've already started.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   OK.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.720]   So it's not too late to follow it, though, if you--
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.080]   You can totally follow it.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.600]   Because I want to know how to behave in high school.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   You're going to feel like a real--
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   I don't think you do.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:37.000]   There's some question, though, whether this will be as public--
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.800]   You know, educational as it was--
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.720]   Well, all stories are kind of like that.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   I mean, think about it.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Yeah, they always--
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   You always--
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.120]   I mean, that's the point of the story, right?
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   The character learns.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.960]   Oh, and Jeff offered us a clip from Sam's scam Austin.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.400]   We're watching it right now, if anybody would be.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.680]   This is the interview that you were talking about, Jeff.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.760]   So apparently there's a sweaty locker room activity with young boys and bottles of water.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.040]   Oh, boy.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.920]   This is aimed at a teenage girl, right?
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.440]   Oh, and he's the gay kid, I betcha.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   And he's a little--
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   It's Norway.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.720]   It's Norway, my friends.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   [LAUGHS]
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320]   Wow, this is a little hot.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   [LAUGHS]
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   OK.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.760]   He lives losing his breath here.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.760]   It's quite sexy.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   [LAUGHS]
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.400]   So I can't handle that.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   The audience is watching.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.000]   I don't know if we can air this.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   [LAUGHS]
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   There's a lot of--
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   They're all--
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   They're all cloged.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   They're all cloged.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.240]   They're in tighty whiteies.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.320]   It's-- oh, somebody just threw milk against the wall.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.240]   This is Norwegian metaphor.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.920]   And oh my god.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.320]   Oh, he just got hit.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   [LAUGHS]
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.720]   OK, I think you didn't even know exactly what this is, and they would appreciate being
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   in the know.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.800]   Yeah, so this is suggestive without actually being pornographic.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.480]   And yeah, so I doubt the American one will be like this, but who knows, right?
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.760]   And then did Facebook work with this Norwegian producer and company?
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.920]   I know that Fijisimo interviewed her on stage, and they obviously loved that they're doing
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   this.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   Of course.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920]   So they helped in some way.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   I don't think they paid him for it or anything.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920]   But man, come here, what about that?
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.920]   I don't know.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   Maybe they did.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   Here's the--
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Here's the creator.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   This is at Media Morphosis.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   It's first and foremost.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.000]   I don't know how many of you know about the show.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.240]   So we will start from the beginning.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.640]   So Scum is a drama series that runs--
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   Scum.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.520]   They read online through this web page.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.520]   And it's--
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.520]   So it starts--
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.280]   So on this one, it starts at a web page, not on Facebook Watch.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.480]   Ah, so Facebook managed to untaste them in.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   OK.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.320]   Well, maybe they were using Facebook as a platform.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.120]   Yeah, this is-- boy, this is in a new era, isn't it?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   That's very interesting.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   It is.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.040]   It's something created for the medium, rather than just trying to repurpose old-time TV.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.600]   Yeah, and if you want to follow it in the US, you have to go to the Facebook page for
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.320]   Scum Austin, which is SKAM.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.880]   Norwegian for Shame.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.760]   Oh, my God, Shame.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   Dang.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.120]   So if I follow it now, I'm going to get a lot of stuff.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.000]   By the way, here's a bunch of other shows that are also on Facebook Watch.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.920]   And I feel like, you know what?
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.920]   It is now officially old-fashioned.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   Oh, for--
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   It is.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920]   It's not fashion-
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.920]   Compared to--
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   We were the cathode raid tube--
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   Boy, that was way too fast.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.960]   From crying out loud, it's only 13 years old.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.760]   It's the teenager still.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.040]   Oh, you want to watch a-- we can catch up on full episodes of Scum Austin.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.200]   There's been eight weeks already.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   Let's just watch a little bit.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.440]   I hope we get the locker room.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.040]   What's the American version?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   The church content.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   What about that?
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920]   This video may include profanity.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.280]   Hey, it's both watch prevents.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   I don't know.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   I don't know.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.120]   I just need to perform all the time.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.680]   Twelve point eight million views of this premiere episode.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.120]   Like, today I will get about five to get ready for--
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.120]   So that, wait a minute.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.040]   Now I got to tell you, 12.8 million views is network-sized programming.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.600]   Not network hit, but network-sized.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   Network-sized.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   And given--
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   Cable-sized, certainly.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.960]   Bigger than most cable.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.360]   Bigger, yeah.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:39.120]   And given that it's got legs, that it's not like a TV show that airs once, now I have
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.760]   to point out that that's the first episode, next episode, 4.4 million, then 3.8 million,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.600]   then 1.4 million, dipped under a million on week five, went back to 1.4 on six, under
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.440]   a million, week seven, and then 1.2 on week eight.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.920]   So that's a little bit more in line with what I expect for a web series, roughly a million.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.960]   Of teenagers of that.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.320]   But the aggregate views might be higher because you've also got the Facebook, I mean the Instagram
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   part of it, right?
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.760]   There's more-- there's someone Instagram, right?
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   Yes.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.320]   You can follow the characters on Instagram and see their interactions.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   Is there any advertising?
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   Yes, I think.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   I don't know.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   I don't see any.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.280]   I don't know.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:33.240]   This would be a perfect thing for the advertising to be not overt interstitial ads.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.920]   That's my hometown, you guys.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:41.040]   But you recognize Spanky's graffiti there.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.560]   Started April 24th.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   New drops daily.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.440]   Oh, that was just a tease.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   Sorry.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   So it's daily.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.640]   Daily, that's a lot of work.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.440]   But they break it up and they're not half hour episodes.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.200]   They're like one minute or not.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   Let's see what's going on in week eight.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.760]   So what I was saying is that the ads could be product placement.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.720]   In fact, product placement probably worked really well in this.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.000]   If she's wearing a sweater that's really cute.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   If you really think that I look at you--
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.920]   Or you look great in that makeup.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.920]   What is it?
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.720]   Start behaving like a human being.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.760]   Quit walking around like a cliche.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   It was magnetic.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.280]   Oh, there's so many.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.040]   Challenge is going to be getting good writing and great storytelling in this.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   Right?
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   But they're TV people.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.120]   They got the people who did the Norwegian one.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.040]   I don't think that's-- I think the challenge is we don't know the challenge because it's
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   a whole new format.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.080]   So we've got to see how people interact with it.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.720]   Ultimately, though, I got to say ultimately, maybe this is me again being old fashioned.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   Story is everything.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.080]   I mean, you could talk-- and we've seen this before with nonlinear forms of storytelling
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.480]   that the story, the acting, all of that has to work.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   I still believe it has to work.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.840]   And you have to get great writers.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.200]   Admittedly, this is even harder because they have to write in a new form that maybe they're
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.160]   not familiar with.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   But that, you can solve.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.120]   But you're going to have to get great writers to come to it.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.240]   You know what it's reminding me a little bit of, and we were talking about this on Windows
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.880]   Weekly, is another new medium that is about to take off.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:21.400]   We talked about it last week, esports.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.880]   And the Wall Street Journal had an article today about professional stadiums being built.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:34.160]   Arlington, Texas is starting construction on a 100,000 square foot arena for live video
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   gaming.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   Geez.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160]   Competition.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   It's awesome.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.200]   Well, it's going to be a billion dollars a year.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.800]   This year, they're going to be close to a billion dollars in making a billion dollars
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   in esports.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.800]   It's $938 million.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   It's up 340 something percent.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:54.040]   A loan is put aside $100 million for purses for Fortnite competition.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   This looks like it's Overwatch, if you want to watch the Wall Street Journal video.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.840]   This is an esports event, an Overwatch event.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.400]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.920]   That's League of Legends.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.600]   Thousands of people show up.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.480]   purses are, yes, in the millions.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   Look at this.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.280]   How would you build a venue specifically for this?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.800]   Well, that's the, actually, that's the good news.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.760]   You build a venue and you could use it for other things because it's really a proscenium.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.240]   You know, it's a stage with a lot of video.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.480]   I'll presume all around.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.320]   In fact, well, one of the things I experienced with this, what made me think of it is when
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.800]   I watched the, my whole opinion of this completely came around when I watched the Fortnite
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.240]   Pro Am last week at the Eddy 3.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.960]   I realized, yeah, I get it.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   This is fun.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.640]   This is fun to watch.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.000]   But you're going to have the same exact issues that I saw with SCOM, which is it's a new
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.480]   medium and you're going to have to get directors who understand how to follow the action.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.760]   It was a real problem with the Fortnite thing.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.640]   Things would happen on, you know, off screen because somebody, there's 100 players diving
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.600]   in and there's 100 battles or 50 battles going on and the director has to be smart enough
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.240]   to know exactly what to show.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:16.440]   It's more like a perfect use for VR where you could maybe check out different maybe or
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   instant replay.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.120]   I mean, you know, and then commentators, you need to, they're going to need to develop.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   The commentators were actually surprisingly good, but still amateurish, but you're going
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.680]   to need to develop commentators who can, because sports is only as good as the commentators
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.760]   can bring it to life, you know, and get you engaged.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.520]   Well, but they'll get there.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   They will.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   They'll totally get there.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:42.640]   Because I was, so I've every year when F1 race comes to Austin, I get to go because various
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.640]   tech companies are sponsoring various aspects of it.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:51.880]   So one year I was in there talking to the guy who does, who's in charge of all the cameras
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.160]   and directing everything and the setup they have there, it's this amazing data center
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.040]   that they actually have to be able to put up in 24 hours and then take down in 48.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   It's crazy.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.800]   And they put it on like three planes.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.880]   But what they've got there, he said one of the hardest parts of his job was actually
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.360]   learning both the camera angles they needed, but also understanding the latency of the
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.920]   physical equipment so he could get to where he needed to be in broadcast it quickly,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.400]   which I didn't really appreciate.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.000]   But as a nerdy audience, you guys would be like, whoa.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.160]   So that was just throwing that in there.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.080]   That's the same sort of thing with the e-sports.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.360]   Other challenge, e-sports events can go on as long as 24 hours.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.040]   It's like a cricket.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.320]   It's electronic cricket.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Here is the Burbank.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   People love cricket.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.080]   Here's the Burbank Center where they're playing Blizzard's Overwatch.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.840]   People bring signs, they cheer.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.680]   They know who the players are.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   These players are big stars.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.000]   Leo, back to your point about the commentators.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.760]   I'm not so sure that you're our old far enough.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.200]   My standards may also not apply.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   It's the same thing.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.000]   It's like who would think that PewDiePie would be a big star, right?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.480]   It's something different.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.440]   No, no, I completely agree.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.360]   It's a new medium and new stars will show up.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.000]   There's some simple, I mean, yes, there's a style thing and I'm not expecting to like
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.880]   or understand their style, but you also have to cover the event.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.240]   You have to be showing the big thing that's happening.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.160]   There's a few purely technical things they have to do.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.800]   But no, I think we're close.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   I think we're close.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   This is interesting.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.440]   Watch a new medium being born.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.520]   It's super fun and it'll die in like 10 years.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.520]   That's the crazy part.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   Something new will replace it.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.920]   I love this and it's here.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.440]   It terrifies me.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.800]   Well, it terrifies me because podcasting used to be the next big thing.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   No, it's over.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.120]   I'm just going to double podcasting.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.360]   One thing I've already left.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.280]   I've already make the leap from radio into podcast.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   I can't.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   This is it.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:04.600]   I've already made no human can expect to transit two different media.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.120]   Oh, what about it?
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.440]   Will you have shatners doing something with it?
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   No, is that true?
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.680]   Yeah, Bitcoin.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   I think that doesn't count.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   But thank you for it.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   Thanks for trying.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   I appreciate it.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   I'm talking about out there.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   I feel better.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   You will.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   He's doing Bitcoin.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.080]   He gets paid a fortune for it.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.600]   Well, yeah, he's a star already.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.880]   So wow, very interesting.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:37.720]   I guess in some ways we could say that this show is really about the future in that respect.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.480]   That we're looking at things that are starting to happen that are going to change our relationship
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.680]   with the outside world.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   Right?
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   Sure.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:54.800]   Facebook also says it's opening Facebook watch to more kinds of content.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.040]   So I think if your Facebook, you're smart, we know that they have a game show platform
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   now.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.280]   This is to me, I saw this.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.080]   I thought this is brilliant.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:10.920]   You could compete with HQ or you could make HQ like platform that a million people can
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.080]   make HQ.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.280]   So this is the game show platform with interactive video.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.280]   They're launching.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.840]   So anybody can create their own HQ.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   That's so smart.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.920]   The Fresno's What's in the Box where viewers get what's inside a box.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.280]   Buzzfeed news is outside your bubble.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:37.040]   contestants have to guess what their opponents are thinking.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.240]   Business insiders confetti viewers answer trivia questions and can see friends responses
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.160]   with winners splitting the cash.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.000]   See HQ is already looking old at.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   That's pretty funny.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So let's go through.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.200]   Let's just catalog for a minute.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.720]   All the various video platforms now.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   You have Facebook doing Facebook live plus watch.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.000]   You have Instagram doing his new video thing.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.560]   You have YouTube, you have you have Microsoft's doing mixer.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.520]   We're on mixer, by the way, and it's a great platform.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.840]   mixer.com/twit.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.560]   You have Twitter.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.920]   Twitter's all over video.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.240]   What is Twitter's latest on that?
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.400]   For a while, I was seeing a lot of stuff on Twitter.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.000]   You know, I tune in Bloomberg would be over there on the side and I don't see that as
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   much anymore.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Is that?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.320]   Bloomberg is still doing it.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   I think.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   Oh, are they?
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.320]   I see a lot of cheddar.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.360]   They're making a lot of money on it.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   Are they really?
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   Yeah, they are.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   They actually are.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   Does.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   I don't see it right now.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   I guess it's embarrassing right now.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   Go to @tiktokticoc.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.720]   That's their thing, isn't it?
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   It's there.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   It's doing it.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   Yep.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   It's not on the front page.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.280]   It's a specific page.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.040]   And does Twitter share the revenue on this?
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.240]   This is actually, but this isn't what I was talking about.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.720]   This is just a Twitter feed by TikTok.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.480]   There used to be under like the who to follow.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.480]   Yes, that's right.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   You have a little.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.160]   I imagine that'll happen again, but right now it's not there.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   I haven't seen it.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.240]   Maybe it only does it during times.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.920]   It feels that people would watch.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:22.200]   Maybe that's it.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.560]   But YouTube, I think.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.400]   So what I've done with the list, Periscope's gone, right?
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.400]   Oh, right.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.200]   Periscope is gone.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.720]   But Periscope and Vine, it started kind of almost started this.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.120]   Oh, Snapchat.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.520]   We almost forgot.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.960]   And what is it?
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.240]   There's Vimeo and Twitch and I guess Vimeo is still around.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.520]   There's Vimeo, I think Vimeo, they're owned by IAC, right?
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.520]   PSCP.TV.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.520]   Is that a reborn Periscope?
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   That's Periscope, yeah.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.680]   Yeah, it's still there.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   Still there.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.880]   I don't know if, yeah, I guess Twitter still owns it.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.920]   And then there's Tout, which is bigger than I knew.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   I don't know Tout.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.080]   Tout's a Tout's, the Tp--
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   Don't be careful for the--
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.320]   This confirms what you were saying last week, Jeff, that the AT&T Time Warner merger
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:19.200]   isn't really threatening because it's the old giants desperately trying to hold on
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.040]   to their business model while it's completely going out from under them.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   Yes.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.320]   The thing that worries me is that all of the stuff we just described still needs internet
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:37.600]   access and the incumbents, the entrenched existing players are dominant there and no
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.840]   one's loosening their grip.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.120]   Well, you could argue.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   So here's what you would argue.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.280]   You'd say, hey, I'm a creator of some sort of video.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.640]   I want to get an audience.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.760]   Instead of going to the internet directly, like the way you and I have done, we would
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.240]   go to Facebook or AT&T or Comcast.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.440]   The beauty of it is you get-- as a content creator, you get free distribution.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.000]   Right.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.560]   But as consumers, it's--
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   You have to find it.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   It's still one of those places.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.760]   It's similar to the way it used to, which is you've got a provider.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:18.600]   And if you don't meet any provider-- if no provider loves you, you're just going to
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   go out on your own--
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.720]   You don't get it at all.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   You don't get it at all.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.320]   Well, you could still get it.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.320]   You just wouldn't have any on it.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.520]   You talked last week that 5G might change this, right?
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:34.920]   We talked about using 5G as a way to bring new people to challenge the incumbents.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   Right.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:42.520]   And into areas where wired internet just doesn't exist as in the rural areas.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.960]   Okay, so no, 5G is terrible for rural areas.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   Oh, really?
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   I'll say this a thousand times.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.800]   It's good for suburban and urban areas.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   It's like YMAX.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   Right.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.320]   We thought YMAX was going to solve it too, but it turned out-- so 5G, you need so many
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.280]   little micro towers that you just-- it's not-- it's just as bad as wiring it.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.760]   Well, you still need backhaul.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.520]   So you still need the way to get on.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   Right.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   So you still need to wire it.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.000]   Yes, you still need a wire somewhere in the next-- it's solved the last mile problem,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   though, right?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.080]   It's solved the last mile problem, but the problem with rural areas is like the last
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   25 miles problem.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.880]   Tout says it has an audience of 85 million.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880]   What?
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   It's an app, right?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   This is Facebook 71.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.800]   I think it's white label for publishers and stuff.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.240]   It's the TV network for the internet.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   And here is-- what the heck?
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.720]   I never even heard that personalized TV experience delivers--
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.240]   You're going to threaten to invest into it.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.240]   And so I know.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   It delivers--
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   It delivers--
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   It delivers--
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   It delivers papers.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   They do it.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.400]   The video programming people love based on who they are and where they are across the
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   web.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.920]   That's a code for tracking.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.920]   Yep.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   And advertisers love--
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.920]   Oh, it's evil.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.800]   Well, they love it because-- and it's one of the reasons why-- you know, we're having
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   trouble.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.880]   Podcast is going to have trouble because we can't and won't do that kind of tracking.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   Yep.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:10.720]   300 channels of premium video programming across news, sports, entertainment, and lifestyle.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.440]   So is it an app?
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   I should know this.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.600]   Well, it's an immersive video viewing experience with robust discoverability and multi-channel
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   browsing.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   It looks like it's an app.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   A lot of T-O-U-T.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   Well, it's also on the desktop.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.400]   On-demand video delivered at just the right moment.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   Oh, no.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.400]   I think it's white label.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   Wait, what is this?
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   Oh, is this--
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   You're watching this?
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   Are you WT?
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   No.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   Is that who-- oh, OK.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   Tout.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   T-O-U-T-O-U-T.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400]   OK.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   Sorry, yes.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.640]   I stopped paying attention.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.200]   Me too.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.280]   And I'm talking.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:51.880]   So Fox is using it, Time's using it, helping producers access quality audiences beyond
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   their own properties.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:59.240]   Oh, so see, so we would be a potential client because they would distribute our video in
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   their--
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   Ooh.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.080]   Look at the analytics, and that's the key.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.720]   That's really the key.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:11.320]   Curate, whitelist, and blacklist, specify domains, track and monitor all KPIs at the
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   domain level.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   Key performance.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.880]   Always on the party audience.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.680]   Key performance indicators.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.440]   That's it.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.880]   I chose to go years without asking what that stood for.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.600]   I just love people use the jargon all the time, but then finally I had to figure it
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.600]   out.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.160]   I wish I had that luxury.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.480]   Audience, verification and brand safety analysis.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   Yeah, it's Nielsen, basically.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:38.800]   Oh, does that mean it won't play next to your show won't play next to a crazy man?
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Right.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   I don't know.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   Master baiting into a teddy bear.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:48.880]   Well, not only that, but it's also going to be-- it's the copyright holders.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880]   Ah.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880]   Right.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:59.120]   Speaking of copyright, this is just just just wind me up.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.920]   And it's not the law.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.920]   It's not the law.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.760]   It's not the law yet in the European Union, but--
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.320]   Though section 13 just got passed by a key committee.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.040]   The committee is passed it on, and the members of the European Parliament will have to vote
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.360]   sometime between December of this year and the first half of 2019.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:27.800]   This is article 11 and 13 passed by the jury committee, but the European Parliament has
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.760]   to have a plenary vote, and that won't happen till later this year.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.760]   Let me say it.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.920]   Let me say it.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:40.880]   This is the Leistung Schutzrecht-Gahn nuclear and Europe-wide.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:48.920]   And it requires such things as everyone who takes content in must have pre-moderation
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.240]   checks for copyright.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.680]   Number one.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:59.880]   And number two, it is a link tax and enables publishers to try to charge the likes of Google.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.440]   This is why Google News left Spain, and now it's going to go Europe-wide.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.120]   It is an effing disaster.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.000]   But more importantly, it will kill memes.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.040]   Yes, it will.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.760]   Because it will be this.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.840]   You won't be able to post a meme because these automated content filtering mechanisms
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.320]   Google uses it on YouTube right now.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.280]   Don't know the difference in the imperative, legitimate use, and copyright violation.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.480]   And it's all treated as copyright violation.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:44.040]   Although it's unclear what the remediation, what the appeal processes and all that stuff.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:50.120]   I was in Tel Aviv just yesterday.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   I gave a talk on Monday.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:57.280]   And I went through the unintended consequences of all the EU regulations, legislation, and
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   its courts.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.400]   And I ended up debating with a major French official and with a major EU official over
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.080]   this stuff.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.760]   But it's basically you're seeing that some providers, it's just like American publishers
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   are pulling out of Europe.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.240]   You're going to see people pull out of Europe.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.640]   I was talking to somebody today who has a big company.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.800]   He's going to Latin America.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   He's going to Asia.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   Screw it.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   He's just not going there.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.040]   Because it's not going to be worth it.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.960]   The regulation is so difficult.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.480]   And once again, the effort is to reduce the power of the big platforms.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.320]   The big platforms will end up with more power because they're the only ones who can afford
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.120]   to deal with this stuff.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.040]   Er, that you are.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.560]   It's not too late because it hasn't been voted into law yet.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:47.880]   And just as we often urge or exhort our American viewers to call their member of Congress,
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:53.080]   you should call European viewers, call your members of the European Parliament and say,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   explain.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:00.520]   So they understand why this is a terrible idea.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:10.600]   Israel is considering legislation to require pre-monitoring of all content put on.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:16.840]   France is considering fake news legislation to penalize people for publishing fake news.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.640]   They think they could control the world.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:25.680]   Well, they're making a good faith effort to fix a problem.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.760]   They're just doing it in a really stupid way.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.280]   And I don't know that we have the data that says that the problem is as big as this presumption
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   is.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.920]   Well, I think right now everything's so in flux, it's hard to define how to.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.800]   We see some things wrong that the outcomes are not what we're after.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:48.120]   We don't understand yet what causes those outcomes because this is so new and so fast
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.120]   moving.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   So they're just taking a stab at it.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   And-
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.920]   >> But it's a stab that has huge impact.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   >> It does.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.880]   >> I do fault them because they're also, the thing I heard about legislators in all across
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.360]   Europe as in the US, as in Israel, is they all don't know how the internet works.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.160]   They're ignorant as hell about the internet.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.120]   And one of them yelled back on that point.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.640]   This is awful, you're telling us we have to wait to be patient.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.440]   No, we have to take charge of this and we have to run the world and this is terrible.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   And the presumptions are terrible.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.600]   Like one person I was debating with was going on about how basically was calling all 2 billion
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.560]   people on Facebook stupid and chumps for being there.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.080]   I said, no, people are there for a reason.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.200]   They're doing something they want to do.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.000]   If you don't start from that understanding, then try to figure out what's what.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.240]   And you come in and say, I'm going to stop them all from doing this.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.560]   That's ridiculous.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.040]   But it's a terribly paternalistic thing.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.240]   You're right, it's all well-intentioned, I agree with that.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.440]   But the intention and the intelligence are far apart on this stuff and the damage can
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.440]   be huge.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.640]   >> I think we need less.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.440]   >> We need less people in office who are powerful and proud and think they know so much.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:07.800]   I think one of the challenges we're facing is we're shifting from a society that's, like
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.480]   you said, very paternalistic to one where people want to have more say and need to have
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:19.920]   more say because the experience is so much more customized to so many different people.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.160]   And so we're moving again from mainstream and mass to something more fragmented.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.400]   >> I don't know how it works in the European Parliament.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:36.200]   But here in Good Old America, members of Congress are not really looking out for the people,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:43.800]   for some are, I suppose, but for the most part, they're protecting the company.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.280]   That's what they do, they're protecting companies.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   >> And institutions.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   >> And institutions.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   >> And the institutions.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:53.800]   >> And that's what this law does is it's IP law to protect the institutions and the copyright
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   holders.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   >> Yes.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.600]   >> It's brought by new paper with new media companies.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   >> Right.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:04.160]   >> And the meme makers think it's not their, it's only nominally their constituency.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.640]   I would guess is what I'm saying.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.820]   >> But their
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   >> Is in the institutions.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.320]   >> Yes, you're absolutely right.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.240]   Or is that a really painful point of view?
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240]   >> No, no, you're completely right.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.240]   >> It is a cynical point of view.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.240]   >> But it's true.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   >> They almost paid it in populist terms, though.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240]   >> Well, yeah, okay.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   But let's be realists about it.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.400]   >> That's a bail.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.120]   >> And do, excuse me for not knowing this, I presume that members of the European Parliament
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   are voted in.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.760]   It's a democratic institution.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.920]   >> Yes, that's true.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.960]   >> And so just as in the United States, they probably care about votes, ultimately, if
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.440]   they want to keep their job.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.240]   But I don't know what the turnout is for EU elections.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   I think it's very low.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   >> It's kind of low.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.520]   >> I mean, I don't know either.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.080]   You know, I mean, that's what's happening in the United States is turnout is solo now
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.960]   that of course you're going to rip your whole-
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.520]   >> Wait, 43% much better than the US.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   >> Yeah, it is.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   I take it back Europe.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   I take it back, you care.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.520]   >> I take it back.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.960]   >> Still not even a majority of the eligible voters, but it's-
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.480]   >> No, but- >> Somebody's voting.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.560]   But I don't know, do you really care?
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.960]   I mean, you still want to serve the institutions.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.280]   Even if, I think even if you're kind of forward thinking and not cynical and altruistic, you
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.800]   think that the institutions are what makes this world work.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.720]   >> Well, so in some cases they are and in some cases the institutions have been denigrated
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.840]   by people who have an interest against them or nihilistic people.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.200]   Which is kind of what's happening here.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.760]   >> Right, yep.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:43.880]   >> But what Jeff is talking about is curbing media platforms and kind of some of the spread
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.680]   of the high, these data companies and the internet and what's happened with Google and
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.080]   Facebook and so that's a little bit different than-
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:58.520]   >> I guess you could argue to a politician, well, you want to promote innovation.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.760]   You want to promote the next thing.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.120]   You want to do stuff that's going to create jobs.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:09.320]   So you don't want to completely tilt the law in favor of the entrenched-
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:14.600]   >> Well, that's silly because you can protect innovation and kill jobs.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:19.160]   I mean, those are just things that we shout when we're trying, we're too lazy to actually
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.920]   look at the terms in the legislation.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.280]   So whenever someone says kill innovation, I'm just like, I don't care.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.520]   Just ignore them and get to the root of the problem.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.960]   >> Okay, I mean, yes, you're right.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.720]   If you want to preserve coal miners' jobs, innovation is not the way around it to do it.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   >> It could be actually.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.000]   >> Well, it could be a clean coal, but you can train them.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.480]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:47.280]   >> But I mean, you're right, jobs may not be, jobs is a voter issue, not necessarily a politicians
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   issue.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:55.680]   >> But politicians, having just covered the net neutrality flight for a decade, killing
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.360]   innovation, investing innovation, these are just common tropes that mean nothing.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:07.080]   You actually, the problem is, laws, the words themselves matter and nobody actually wants
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.680]   to dig into the words because it's excruciatingly dull.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:17.200]   So, and that's people in the vote, like voters don't vote on that either.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   They don't care about that.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.680]   And it's not wrong for Congress to be like, oh yeah, yeah.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:26.160]   So I don't know what the solution here is.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.960]   >> So Stacey, yeah, there was one of the EU politicians at this event, until of you,
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.720]   argued angrily from stage.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.920]   First, that technology is killing democracy, and second, that technology created populace.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.560]   >> Those are contrary points of view, aren't they?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:51.160]   >> Absolutely, and wrong, and then it got really mad that I use the phrase as to you guys,
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.160]   moral panic.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.720]   It was the definition of it.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.000]   It was the definition of moral panic where he was blaming all of society's problems on
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.480]   the platforms.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.280]   There's a false democracy, bad behavior, Russians, populace, everything was the fault of the platforms.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.600]   And it's human behavior.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.880]   And government is there to regulate human behavior.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.200]   When they don't know how to do it, they pull this kind of number.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.560]   >> Well, okay, so we, in the United States, I don't know enough about how it works in
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   the EU, but in the United States, it's a representative democracy.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:33.080]   We don't expect voters to know the details of each law, the arcana.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:40.480]   They are there to, in theory, set the overall 30,000 foot policy point of view, what we
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   want to work toward.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:48.880]   And then we're hiring people whose job it is, is create staff and create laws that achieve
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.960]   our vision thing, right?
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.240]   So I don't think that that's broken.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.960]   I think that works all right.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:59.360]   >> No, I think it's broken because a lot of people, we're not actually talking about
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   the laws anymore.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.880]   We're talking about, we're slougeneering.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.800]   So it's one thing and we don't talk.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.040]   >> That's more division thing, that's 30,000 foot.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.880]   >> We don't talk about the tradeoffs.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.240]   You have to talk about the tradeoffs when you're talking about a 30,000 foot view still.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.640]   And we don't do that in our politics because either our politicians don't think we can
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   handle it.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   >> Well, that's true.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   >> I don't know why we, I mean, it's one thing to say.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   >> It's one thing to say.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   >> We've got to wait for issue debates and really more towards slougeneering.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.200]   I agree with you on that.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   >> So that's, like if we want to figure out a solution to this, we actually have to start
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.640]   framing our issues as, hey, I believe this matters.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   >> I acknowledge that this is going to hurt the following five constituencies.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   >> Right.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   >> But I believe it's worth it because of this.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   >> That's a good way to do it.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:54.520]   >> That we should foster technologies that allow us to innovate things like new forms of
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.480]   media.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:02.440]   I believe that that may cost people like me a job in the short run, but in the long run
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.560]   it's part of the refreshing and renewing process that will create new kinds of jobs for another
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   generation.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.720]   That's, is that the kind of thing you're talking about?
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   >> Yes.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.880]   Like, what are debt neutrality, you know, if we're talking about that?
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   >> Same thing.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.080]   >> I'm more interested in what the future of a free and open internet can bring us than
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:30.920]   the potential risk of loss of revenue to Comcast Verizon, AT&T and Sprint.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.640]   >> Or the loss of something like zero rating for yourself.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   >> Right.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   >> That's a hard one.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   >> Yeah, that's a hard one.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   >> So you, you know, or-
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.440]   >> But at least here we have those conversations at that.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:47.240]   >> We do, and some, I mean, we do, we do, and I wish we had them in other places, because
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.120]   I think it's fine to have a viewpoint, but I think it's ridiculous for us to all run
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:55.480]   around just shouting, and that's, it's not the soul.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.560]   Everything's wrong with our, the soul thing that's wrong with our country, but that's
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.880]   a big challenge to an informed bait, and that's hurting us badly.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.080]   >> It's always been, it's always been though, at least as long as there's been mass media,
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:13.760]   it's always one of the, one of the ways politicians manipulate the electorate is with fear, you
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.280]   know, yellow journalism.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.440]   And, you know, some proportion of the electorate is always going to fall for that.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:25.800]   And you know, the debate over the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the family separation and
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:32.720]   the borders, really good example of, I don't, I think that it is too, you could say it's
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.960]   slogan earring and there's fear mongering and there is a lot of that going on, but
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:41.920]   I think there's also, if you cut through all of that two different points of view that
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.200]   are at odds with one another, that are not, you know, I mean, I have one that, so I don't
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   like the other, but, but that are, that are points of view that you could reasonably hold,
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.320]   one that our borders need to be protected and the laws need to be enforced and the other
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.280]   that, you know, I personally don't think our borders should be protected.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.240]   I think there's evidence that migrants actually improve the economy.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:06.040]   Those are two different points of view that, but we're not arguing that because there's
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   a lot of this emotional.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:13.680]   >> Well, and you could also expand it because there is also a worldview that right now we
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:20.640]   are experiencing such a radical change from climate, from technologies, from destabilization
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:26.720]   and governments that migration and mass migration is going to become a real issue from a lot
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.560]   of the poorer parts of the world to the richer parts of the world.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.560]   >> Right, exactly.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.680]   Which is why that's why I don't dismiss the protect our borders argument.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.840]   I understand that argument, you know.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.200]   >> So, but we're not fighting over that right now.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   >> No, I know.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   >> That's the problem.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.200]   >> Well, some people are.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   I don't think that's true.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.000]   I think some people are.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.800]   I think that at root you get down to it.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.000]   That kind of is what the debate is about.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.720]   >> Right, but we have to, I don't think we're acknowledging that at all.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.680]   I think we're just talking about borders, but what we really need to be thinking about
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.800]   is what happens when we make a large portion of the world uninhabitable for serious reasons.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.560]   >> The problem is though, if you make it too complex and everybody gets frozen because
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.320]   it's too much to figure out.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:12.040]   I mean, you can't make, you can, you have to dumb it down a little bit, Stacy.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.480]   >> Well, yes, but we have to, I think we have to start from that.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.240]   We have to create categories based on that.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.200]   We have to circle back around to that.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   It is complicated.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.040]   It's horrifyingly complicated.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:28.080]   But if we don't understand that, we can't actually create realistic policies.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.840]   >> How can a democracy or even a republic work if you don't kind of boil it down to some
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.320]   simple concepts and say, well, here's your choice, A or B.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:43.360]   >> But this, see, Trump and the people who are so freaked out about borders right now,
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.120]   yes, we can talk about being racist, we can talk about all of this.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:56.240]   But at their core is a very real fear that this macro change is going to lead our country
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.480]   to become- >> It's very disruptive.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.320]   >> Well, I think the reason you see nationalism rising is because the nation as an institution
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.480]   is challenged.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.480]   >> Right.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.440]   >> And so, Stacey, you're right.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:13.480]   But it's at a macro level that it's hard to put into what Leo wants, which is things
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   like short phrases like death panel.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.480]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.880]   >> Yeah, but it's good.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   >> Right?
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.600]   >> Well, it'd be nice to avoid the heavily emotionally charged phrases.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.640]   But I noticed- >> The Guardian's nationally charged.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.720]   When you see Rachel Maddow burst into tears on television, it's hard to say it's not
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   emotionally charged.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.480]   >> Well, it's a theory of setting.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.480]   >> It's upsetting.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   >> I'm upset.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   >> It was a reveal.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.280]   The Center for Professor of Foreign just put up a report based on federal court filings
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:47.080]   of children being injected with cocktails of drugs to pacify them in these centers.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:53.480]   The Guardian today published a complete accounting of 34,361 documented deaths of refugees and
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   migrants because of Fortress Europe.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   Right?
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   Meanwhile, you have Trumpists in the AFD in Germany and Brexiters and so on.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.080]   Speaking of moral panic, it's not technology in this case.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.920]   It's turning the other, the stranger into an enemy who's going to steal your job and steal
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.880]   your home and steal your child and steal your daughter's job.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.480]   >> Yeah, but so Jonathan Heit talks about this a little bit.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.080]   And what he said, really though, you can boil it down to some fundamental disagreements
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.360]   in worldview.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.600]   And is that reasonable to debate those?
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.200]   That's reasonable to debate those.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.680]   We should probably get rid of all of the highly charged rhetoric.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.880]   >> You have to understand the big worldviews, I think.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:40.000]   I think it'd be easier if you can recognize when you're hitting up against an issue where
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.480]   you can change someone's mind in a worldview where they're probably that's like core to
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   who they are.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   >> He kind of says that.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.480]   That's one of the things he says.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:53.120]   He says, we have this notion that we're reasonable creatures that we act upon reason.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:59.480]   He says, really, reason is a little person trying to drive the giant elephant of emotion
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:05.320]   and what reason often ends up doing is justifying the way the elephant's going because emotion
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.320]   is going to take us there.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.360]   It's a reason's job to say this is why rather than to try to steer the dang thing.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.880]   >> This is why I argue that there's three, my new definition of journalism, to convene
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:21.200]   communities into civil, informed, and productive conversation and civility comes first.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.240]   What should be happening now?
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.120]   Journalism's role and Facebook's role should be trying their best to introduce people to
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.400]   these brown strangers of the border and make us understand their humanity.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.960]   >> I agree they should be.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.960]   I agree they should be.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.240]   It's kind of misunderstanding how these businesses are formed.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:48.320]   Even ABC, CBS, and NBC are not really formed in the public wheel.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.280]   They're formed as profit-making businesses.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.360]   >> I don't think profit.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:59.840]   >> Every journalist shows the New York Times, every media company for the last 200 years
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.840]   has been.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:05.200]   That's why journalists believe they have standards that have them rise above that.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.560]   >> That transcends that, yeah.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.160]   With mixed success.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   >> Amen, brother.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.160]   >> Amen.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:22.000]   >> I think when you get to Facebook, you're asking Facebook, a lot of Facebook, you certainly
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.880]   can ask a New York Times reporter to understand that.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.560]   But the average Facebook employee doesn't come from that background.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:33.080]   >> But if Facebook says that they, right, this is my argument that I've made.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:39.760]   Facebook's definition of community is too shallow and temporal that it's about conversation.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.840]   That's going to get us in trouble just like Clickbait does.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.760]   I can make you converse because I can make you angry.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.600]   >> But we didn't think it would.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.040]   I mean, that may be something that's come to light recently.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.960]   But if you look at groups, right, if you look at groups on Facebook where there's bad stuff
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.160]   there, right, but what could groups be on Facebook?
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.160]   It truly could be.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:02.080]   And I see this happening in anonymous groups where you see communities truly coming together
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.080]   and doing things.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.160]   >> Isn't it the nature though?
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:11.480]   It seems to be the nature of the beast that all social, all commons areas on the Internet
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.040]   end up descending into this.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.760]   And they always have over after a period of years.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   No matter what.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.320]   It's going back to even Google Plus now.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.480]   Going back to the news groups, Google Plus is awful.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.360]   But it's mostly because it's untended.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   >> But the new groups.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.040]   >> I think there are maybe ways to design this.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.320]   I think they're really curious about that, frankly.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:38.560]   Is it possible to have a social network that doesn't after a period of years decline into
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.720]   madness?
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.440]   >> So did the well as a version of the well-probeant class?
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   >> The well did.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   >> Yes.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.440]   >> Yes, it did.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.440]   >> Do you go on, never did.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.440]   Which didn't?
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.800]   >> Giga Oum didn't.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.640]   >> Was Giga Olm a social community?
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.640]   >> No.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.840]   Well, we had lots of commenters who talked to us all the time.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.840]   >> No.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   >> But yeah.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   >> I think Giga Olm didn't last long enough.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.800]   If it had lasted longer, it might have.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   YouTube did.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.800]   Twitter did.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.200]   The well did.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   News groups did.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:12.280]   Every time you have these wonderful conversations and beautiful areas where people are communicating
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.320]   somehow, for some reason, maybe it's, I don't know.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.600]   I would love to know why.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.720]   >> I think it's openness.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.880]   I think that openness will, complete openness or near complete openness will lead to manipulation.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.840]   And bad guys come in and they trash it.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.840]   >> Right.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:28.840]   >> And you have to invest.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.040]   So Ant-Probe says that's a feature of society as a whole.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   Is that true?
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.760]   If you hang out, I mean, if you get a large enough group together, I mean, you get four
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   of your friends together.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.760]   >> Turns into a mob.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:43.720]   >> Well, I was going to say your four friends are like, and then you have a party and then
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   some guy gets really trashed and then you're like, I'm a guy.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:54.760]   >> I remember as a kid in the 60s, participating in war protests that got out of hand because
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.440]   it's very easy in a mob for a mob to get out of hand.
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.080]   No one person can has the responsibility.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.640]   It's very much like Twitter or some sort of social network.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.880]   It spins out of control.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:11.480]   And then you do things as part of a mob that you would never do by yourself ever like set
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.640]   cars on fire.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:19.440]   You know, speak for yourself.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   >> Jerry the Red.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.400]   >> I never set a car on fire, but I've sought things like that happen.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.760]   And I and it and you kind of sweeps you what you get swept away in the mob.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:27.760]   Have you ever been in a mob?
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.760]   >> Well, there's a mob.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   >> I was like covered.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.480]   I covered the so-called gay riots in San Francisco after Dan White was acquitted.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   >> Mm-hm.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.560]   >> Of the murder of Harvey Billock and George Moscone.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.960]   And yeah, there were cars on fire.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.880]   There was there was there was such anger that came out.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.880]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.520]   But if there were cars in on Twitter, they'd be on fire right now.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.000]   But that but the question you really ask, which is the right one, if you this is a this
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.520]   is a it's a society problem and a design problem.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.400]   And how much control without it being too much control can you put on an interactive
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.320]   platform?
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   >> Right.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.560]   >> Such that this is where I told you about spaceship media, right?
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.800]   >> No, I told you this one.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.400]   >> Oh, perfect.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.040]   So spaceship media is a wonderful organization.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.840]   It's a couple journalists in San Francisco formed it.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.160]   And their first test was getting 25 after the election, getting 25 women who voted for
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.760]   Trump in Alabama, 25 who voted for Clinton in San Francisco.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.440]   And the journalist interviewed them all, got to know them.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.960]   And then they threw them all into a private Facebook group.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.360]   And for the first day, they were talking nicely about their kids and soccer and such
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.280]   and their jobs and their homes and their towns and then it descended.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   >> Right.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.560]   >> But but my friend, then people from the group came to the journalist and said, can
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.720]   you help us out over here?
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720]   Can we get in trouble?
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.360]   Can you look up some stuff for us?
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.680]   The heavens opened and the angels sang because people said that they wanted an informed conversation.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.040]   They trusted and desired facts and they trusted the journalists to get it for them.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   Why?
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.320]   Because the structure that the journalist had set up was to get them all, know them, understand
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.360]   them, introduce them, respect them and expect something higher of them.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.680]   And it's continued for a long time.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.960]   They've done further work with teachers and African American students at high schools.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.080]   They're doing a thing now which full disclosure, we help fund a news integrity initiative at
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.440]   CUNY, which is part of the townite center, which is part of the Craig Newmark Graduate
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.000]   School of Journalism.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.080]   Full disclosure funded in part by Facebook and Craig Newmark.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.720]   We funded an effort to do 5,000 people now.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.960]   >> See, that's what I'm curious about is if it will scale.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.160]   >> That's what we're trying to see.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.120]   My former students are in that.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:50.600]   Meanwhile in Germany, D-site or site online, they did something called Duchland-Sprit, making
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.280]   this into a platform of worldwide in any language.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:59.240]   But they went and quizzed people about five questions, binary.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.760]   Germany has enough migrants, Germany has more room for migrants, right?
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.240]   They found people who registered, who disagreed with each other.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.760]   And of the 12,000 who registered, 1,200 agreed to meet someone with whom they disagreed near
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.920]   them on a Sunday in Germany.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.080]   No fist fights.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:22.280]   My favorite story from here is that the algorithm matched one woman with her father-in-law.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   Right?
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:30.560]   So there are, I think that I see the Corral Project as an effort with Mozilla, New York Times
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:36.320]   Washington Post have been involved, trying to come up with new architecture around conversation.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.160]   A lot of the argument that they make is that you can't just involve people at the end of
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.040]   the process and say, here, talk about this, because they're going to yell because they
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   had no role.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040]   You've got to involve people earlier in their process.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.600]   Was it too late for Facebook and Twitter or can these tech be adapted to the existing?
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   That's a really good question.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:59.400]   So I talked to Deb Roy, who's at the MIT Media Lab, who was kind of a chief data guy for
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.560]   Twitter.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.920]   And his argument was that every capitalistic enterprise is built to a simple metric.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.200]   And that Facebook and Twitter are already built to a metric.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.920]   And that they kind of can't be rebuilt to this extent.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.280]   But he saw opportunity and he's doing a lot of projects.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   He's got one called Cortana.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.920]   No, that's Microsoft.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   Oh, shit.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:30.280]   I'll remember it in a second, which is trying to look at civility in conversation.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   And also he's doing automated analysis of talk radio.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.280]   What kinds of fascinating things are going on?
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.280]   Yeah, indeed.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.280]   Oi.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280]   Oi.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   Oi.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   Oi.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.560]   But he thinks there are ways to engineer new things.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.080]   But that's, I go back to my Gutenberg thing.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080]   It's 1474.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.080]   It's early.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.800]   We've just begun to find ourselves in this thing.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.120]   We don't know what it is yet.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.320]   Is this new media. Twitter.com?
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.960]   Is this a new thing from Twitter?
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.200]   Yes, I put it in there today.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.600]   Is this kind of a long?
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.080]   So what's your field?
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.440]   How do you think this is?
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.440]   How do you think this is?
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440]   Twitter.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   This is business development.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440]   It's Biz Dev.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.520]   But it's not a bad thing.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.560]   Journalists tell their stories on Twitter.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:21.080]   Stacey, the question to me is how your daughter and her friends develop their norms of acceptable
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.160]   communication with each other through all these media.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.760]   I think they're going to figure it out.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.560]   I think they're going to know where the boundaries are and where the trouble begins and start
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.080]   to see how to help each other avoid that.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   I have that faith.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.840]   I don't know.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.040]   That's a really interesting question.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.640]   I'll let you know as I see things evolve.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.120]   Right now, they communicate so much.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.360]   What intrigues me is they communicate so much via like I am and not texting because she
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:58.600]   does not all her friends are on the phone.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.240]   I don't know how they can tell when they're sarcastic, but they know.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.760]   As they get a little older, they can get really nasty with each other too.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.800]   So there's worse to come.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   The middle school is a father.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.440]   She's going into seventh grade.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.120]   Oh, it's just beginning.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.320]   I mean, there's definitely things that, I mean, it's the same story played out in a
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   different medium.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.680]   So we'll see how that works.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.760]   It's great trip brings out the worst.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   Right?
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.760]   They're going to Barcelona.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   Oh, nice.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   You're kidding.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.960]   There's nothing that Hamone Barrico cannot cure.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   What does that mean?
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.960]   Yeah, really?
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.960]   Well, it's an immersion Spanish school.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.520]   They go to Mexico City in seventh grade.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   And then Catalan.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.800]   Then they go to Barcelona.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800]   Great.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.840]   How's your Spanish, mom?
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.320]   Terrible.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.880]   We follow?
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   Nope.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   I speak French.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.960]   You're very useful.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   The Texas.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   Yes.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   Yes.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.800]   When I was growing up in Texas, I decided that I would take French for seven years.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.840]   So another year was social decision.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.040]   We had this debate with my daughter when she was in high school.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.560]   Her mother wisely, as it turned out, said, "You should learn Spanish."
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.520]   I said, "No, learn French.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.480]   It's the language of culture, the language of the arts."
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480]   "The art.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.480]   The art of the report.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.480]   Your name is La Parte."
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.360]   So Abby learned French.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.120]   She ended up spending a year in France as a high school in junior high school where she
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   learned to smoke and drink wine and kiss boys.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:31.880]   And then she realized that maybe it would be more useful learned Spanish so that she
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:37.040]   spent a year in Spain and a year in Merida and a year in Mexico and Puebla.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.560]   So she speaks Spanish and French.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   And actually that's worked out quite well.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:46.480]   Yeah, I get a little confused because when I'm in Mexico or any other Spanish.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   That's the problem.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.120]   I'm sitting there doing this, I don't know what the combination of French and Spanish
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.920]   is, but it's not pretty.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   French.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920]   Neither culture appreciates it.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   Spanish.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   Stop speaking.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   Spanish.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.400]   Disney is upping its offer.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.240]   So I love this watch.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   Oh, what is Saga.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:11.200]   So the Saga is of course, it starts last Monday when AT&T Time Warner is approved by
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   a judge.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.920]   The deal goes through on Friday of last week.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.960]   It's official and immediately Comcast, which said, even admitted we're watching to see
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960]   what the court says.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.240]   As soon as the court said, oh, green lighted it, Comcast up.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.920]   It's been to 65 billion over Disney's 54.5 billion.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.200]   Disney has sweetened its offer.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.160]   This is the Disney offers a merger.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.920]   The Comcast is a hostile takeover.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.840]   But of course, it's shareholders and the board that will decide.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.680]   You don't bother with me in either case, that the man who single handedly ruined American
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.480]   democracy only gets richer.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.680]   It all goes to Rupert, but at least Rupert won't have a movie studio anymore.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.640]   Well, if it is the Disney deal goes through, he is by far the largest shareholder.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640]   Oh, yes.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.720]   Well, now this has changed a little bit.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:05.360]   So Disney is now offering $71.3 billion, but it's half cash, half stock.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.080]   So they changed the proportion.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:15.240]   And Disney is pretty determined to get 21st century Fox.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   And I doubt it has to do with Hulu, although it would be the case that if Comcast got Fox,
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.640]   it would get 60% of Hulu would have majority stake.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.240]   If Disney gets it, it would only have 30%.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.360]   Unless Disney wants to have some other, I don't think they have a majority stake.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.440]   I think Disney wants the movie studio, right?
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.440]   More than anything else.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.240]   It does not include television, does not include Fox sports.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   It does include Sky.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.520]   It doesn't include television?
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.160]   Some television, but not Fox news.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   It doesn't include Fox news.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.160]   Or Fox.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.640]   It includes the Simpsons and all of their crazy cable.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.440]   So by the way, you saw Steve Levitan, the creator of Modern Family, announced that he was leaving
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440]   Fox period.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440]   Oh, but wait a minute.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.840]   Then he tweeted, never mind.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.800]   I'm looking forward to working with Fox again.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800]   These people.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]   No, really.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.600]   Let me, I don't want to put words into his mouth.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.320]   Steve Levitan is his Twitter handle.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.720]   He, yeah, creator of Modern Family.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:17.040]   He was so upset with Fox's coverage of the border crisis that he said and urged others
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.840]   who work for Fox to stop making content to enrich the Verdon family.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.760]   No, he said, he said, it's been a wonderful home for most of my career.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.280]   So many people that are not a da.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.560]   He has no problem with.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.200]   I look forward to seeing Modern Family through to the end.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.280]   That's to say his contract.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.640]   And then sale or no sale setting up elsewhere.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.160]   That's his most recent.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.160]   He did not back down.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:48.160]   Well, thank goodness.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.560]   So Seth MacFarlane kind of kicked it off.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.960]   He's the course creator of the family guy.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960]   Also on Fox, right?
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.560]   Is the family guy on Fox?
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560]   Yes.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560]   Yes.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.040]   That is a Fox show through and through.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:08.120]   Although I have to point out that the people who support this policy have no respect at
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.920]   all or love for Hollywood establishment just confirms their beliefs.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.720]   Yeah, fun.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:25.280]   There's a guy who heckled the Broadway play that Robert De Niro produced.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:35.800]   He stood up and had a wave to America flag and make America great Trump 2020 banner.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.360]   So it's I tell you, it's descending.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.360]   It's the whole thing.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   It is.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.800]   It's a generalize civility problem.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.160]   So Comcast must now decide how much higher it can go without upsetting shareholders according
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.200]   to the LA Times.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.840]   What happened to the stock of the three companies?
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.560]   Good question.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:57.440]   The stock prices for Disney and Fox were up after the announcement.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.200]   Fox stock jumped 8%.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.760]   Disney rose 1%.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.240]   I don't know how Comcast did.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.960]   Really trading on Comcast held steady as investors tried to interpret whether Disney's substantially
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.680]   higher offer means Comcast will be out.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.520]   There's nobody else who can come in.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.120]   This is just too rich.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   That's got Apple, Apple, Amazon, Google or Twitter.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   Yeah, but they don't.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.960]   Well, not Twitter, what am I saying?
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   Well, so Comcast would become, they were talking that they would become the world's most
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.000]   indebted companies.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.960]   So we talked about our history.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.760]   Yeah, we did talk about that.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.000]   Which is what killed newspapers.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.280]   And Comcast stock is already down 20% this year.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.440]   So there's definitely downside to Comcast's debt.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.160]   Yeah, Stacy, I think that's a really important point because if you look at companies like
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:53.360]   Trunk and Digital First where I used to be an advisor and Gate House, it's the debt that
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.920]   the cash flow was fine.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920]   Going down with clear channels.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   Yep.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   Yep.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   Yep.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:07.440]   Next on Monday after it was announced, their stock went down from, it went down.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.080]   It went down because of their up to bid.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.080]   Right.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.280]   So when Comcast raised its bid, that tanked their stock.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   So the stock market's basically saying they want to see a Disney acquisition.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280]   Right.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.120]   And then today, yes, today almost immediately afterwards, no, it went up.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.120]   It went up.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.120]   Oh.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.880]   Yeah, today at one o'clock, it was trading at third.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.960]   It was $32.40 and at three o'clock, it was $33.63.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   So what's that?
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.960]   $2.20.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.960]   So about $5.5.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.520]   What about this?
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.480]   What about this?
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.040]   What about this?
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.200]   What about this?
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.200]   What about this?
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.880]   A tool go on day.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.520]   The doctor and writer is now CEO of Amazon's employee health care joint venture with JP
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.600]   Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.240]   There's no profit pressure for his.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.840]   He is a very well-known New Yorker writer.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.520]   He's author of a four New York Times bestsellers and a surgeon practicing general and endocrine
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.360]   surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital, professor at Harvard's TH Chan School of Public
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.160]   Health and Harvard Medical School.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.920]   And now he's going to run Amazon's health care initiative.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.040]   Is this guy the energizer bunny or what?
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.720]   Well I assume he'll stop doing some of the other things.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.720]   Nope.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.760]   Go on day will continue all his current roles, including the surgeon.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.920]   Yeah, except he will become chairman of Ariadne, which I didn't even mention transitioning
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.040]   from executive director.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.480]   Some people just have a lot of energy.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   I imagine he's just kind of a figurehead.
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.840]   I don't know.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.720]   What you call it a Zafod?
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.280]   Well like Zafod.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280]   Zafod beable brocks.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280]   Beable box?
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280]   Yes.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.920]   Just figure it.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.720]   I'm really curious what Amazon's it's from the hitchhiker's guy to the galaxy.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.280]   Yeah, don't even worry.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:24.320]   Amazon has already automated begun automating its white collar jobs.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.160]   You got to like that.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.920]   But in a way, any job that was predictive, this has kind of been happening too.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.920]   Yep.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:39.360]   And Google has just invested more than half a billion dollars in the number two e-commerce
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.800]   site in China, JD.com.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:50.160]   JD.com is also well known because last week it announced it was shipping over 200,000
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   packages a day from at Shanghai facility using four humans and a bunch of robots.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160]   Yes.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:02.680]   Hey, Google money going to come in handy.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.080]   It's a lot of robots with that.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   Warehouse jobs.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.760]   You know, let's bring jobs back to China.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.120]   What do you say?
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.440]   Well, Trump wants to bring them back to a phone company and Senate doesn't want to.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.440]   No, I know.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.440]   And they're not funny.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.640]   Battle Senate one too, by the way, they put that in the Armed Forces appropriation bill.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   That what it was.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.120]   So I'm not my favorite story of the day.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.200]   Your favorite?
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.200]   What is it?
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.640]   Don't say.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:36.720]   And when we come back, Jeff Jones is the favorite.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.240]   You know, this is this is a.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.200]   And hey, and maybe we'll talk about Google and maybe we'll.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   I mentioned Google.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.360]   I just mentioned Google half a billion dollars.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.560]   I just mentioned Google.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.280]   We may mention some more Google.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.240]   This is an example of how vestigial broadcasting skills do not translate in the digital world
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.280]   because now people just going to skip through the commercial.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.600]   Find out what Jeff's.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.680]   If this were scum.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.400]   If this was scum, they'd have to listen.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.040]   You must listen to the commercial.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.760]   You'd find a way to say, you know, you know, let's move to a new house.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760]   I don't know if I can afford it.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.760]   You got it.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.160]   Well, let's find out.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.000]   Everybody on scum should go to rocket mortgage.com/tweak.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.200]   The new way to finance or refinance a home loan.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.660]   Quick and loans, number one lender in the country, number one in volume, number one in

[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.760]   lender, according to inside mortgage finance.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.640]   I mean, number one in so many ways, but now they're number one in my geek heart because
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.680]   they've created an entirely online mortgage approval process.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.600]   They call it rocket mortgage.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:53.060]   Rocket mortgage gives you the confidence you need when it comes to buying a home or refinancing
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.960]   your existing home loan.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   It's simple.

[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.560]   There's no mystery.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.880]   No, no, no scurrying off.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.480]   No bankers scurrying off to saying, well, let me check the rates.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:11.880]   You don't even have to scurry off to the attic to get your financial documents.

[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.760]   And within minutes, based on income assets and credit, they can analyze all the home loan
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.000]   options for which you qualify and find the one that's right for you.

[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.120]   so that you could do this at an open house.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.800]   And before you leave, show the realtor that big green, your approved button, even have
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.160]   a button below it that says, print this out for your realtor if she's still living in
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.920]   the 20th century.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.200]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans apply simply, understand fully and mortgage confidently.

[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:25.640]   Jeff Jarvis, how about your favorite story of the week that has to do with Google stays?
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.600]   It's not about being able to get windows on my pixel book.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600]   I could care less.
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.760]   Although it's not going to happen.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.080]   We'll come to that in a minute.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.120]   It's not about Google, particularly when I'm going to die because that saddens me.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.600]   Did you do it because I want to know when I'm going to die?
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.600]   No, no, no.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.680]   What it makes, it saves me immensely is catching up for three years.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:52.280]   I will admit with Apple fanboys, I can now finally do messaging, texting from the web.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.880]   Yes, me too.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   Okay.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880]   I did it.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.120]   And it makes me very happy.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.400]   Now, wait one cotton pick in a minute.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:08.240]   This is the new Android Messenger, which is I want to use because it's RCS, which means
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.800]   it's the new standard for rich communication services.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.680]   It supersedes SMS.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.080]   And now that it has a desktop, I really like that.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.600]   But I'm a Google Fi customer, Jeff.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:26.120]   I have multiple phones as far as I can tell messages is tied to one phone number.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.240]   I thought it was tied to one account.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.760]   Well it asks for my, all right.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:35.120]   So you think I could use it in the same way as you hangouts because you're a Fi user,
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.120]   aren't you?
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.120]   Yeah, let me get up my other phone.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.800]   My other phone's a Fi phone after I got my old one back since I lost my Fi.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   I mean, you could.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   It does beg your question.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.760]   Why did they just make hangouts be the different messenger?
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:52.200]   I had lent Sunjake an Android phone so he could develop and I asked for it back.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   What am I?
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:59.440]   All right, so I'm going to put messages, Android messages and say, okay, you're now my default,
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.400]   but see what I want is because I have an iPhone.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.800]   There's no messages for iPhone, is there?
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.800]   I have other.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.800]   I don't care.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.240]   I don't care about you Apple people.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   You turn, coach.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240]   I don't care.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.680]   I just want to use it everywhere.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   I live.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   Love you to Google.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.960]   I don't get all my messages on all my phones.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   That's the thing.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   And that's what we think.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   Let me just try it.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   Let me do.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   I'm waiting for the phone.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.920]   Wait, it says it rolls.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.480]   Is it rolling out to it?
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.320]   It rolled out to everyone?
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.200]   It only about a half hour before the show to roll out to me.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:39.880]   If you go to a messenger and hit the menu on the right, it'll have a message that says
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   messages for web.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.680]   And that has you take a picture of the QR code on the web page to tie that to, I think,
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.120]   your account, not the phone, but we're going to find out in a minute here.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.920]   So I will have the old message on the phone.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:59.400]   Yeah, because I got the QR code that pops up on the, and it says on the desktop, and
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.320]   then it says, pair it with your phone, which makes me think it's to the phone.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:09.720]   No, no, you're all you're doing is taking a picture from your message account of your
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:16.080]   web account and tying it not to the phone number, I think, but instead to your Google
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.520]   account, but I could be very wrong.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.680]   We shall see.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:25.080]   My messenger or sorry, messages account is tied to my phone number.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.440]   But I don't have this option yet.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.400]   So I feel sad.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.320]   Well, anyway, right.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   Maybe the case.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.240]   Anyway, I just I wish that.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.600]   Because I wanted this for every Hangouts is on iOS.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600]   Hangouts is on Android.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.600]   It's on all my phone.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.600]   True.
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.600]   You got to use my Google fine number.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.600]   I got it now.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.600]   Yeah, because it everywhere.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.600]   That's what I want.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.720]   And I can use it on the desktop, and then it's perfect.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.200]   I just would like, I mean, I just don't understand Google.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.200]   I just don't.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.200]   I don't know.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]   I love Hangouts.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.200]   I actually think it's lovely.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   It works for one, I guess, right?
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.200]   You're right.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   I can't.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   It's always using Fi.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.200]   Are you using Fi?
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.760]   No, I love it.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   And though I'm not using Fi.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.640]   That's how much they don't use it if you're not using Fi.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.200]   I think they did.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.600]   But wait, they don't use messages or Hangouts.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.240]   They want Hangouts to be the business solution.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.400]   Well, then I'm using it for business and to talk to my child.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.480]   Yeah, it's unclear.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.480]   Just unclear.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.720]   It's unclear.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   I use Hangouts.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.880]   I'm going to stick with Hangouts.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:33.800]   Elizabeth Holmes and Sonny Balwani indicted and accused of fraud for Theranos.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.040]   So Google is training machines to predict when a patient will die.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:44.720]   The new type of algorithm created by Google read up on the patient's medical record,
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.960]   175,000 data points and said her risk, death risk is 19.9%.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:50.960]   And guess what?
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:51.960]   She died.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.520]   Well, that's only the 8% that she wouldn't.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.080]   So I think I got that wrong.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:02.400]   What's interesting is it uses all the even old, you know, handwritten, hand-notated charts
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.120]   and picks up things in the PDF as data points to use.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.680]   And it tells them why it thinks it made this decision.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.680]   I guess Google is saying this is--
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.720]   So IBM Watson has been doing that for a while.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.040]   But do you really want Watson to say?
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.040]   I'm just saying.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   You're going to die.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.480]   IBM Watson actually had to walk back their health business recently.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.480]   So people are right.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   Uh-huh.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.320]   IBM Watson Healthcare.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   Hold on.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.800]   Keep talking about death and good.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:32.080]   Admittedly, admittedly, it was an improvement over the hospital's computers that read her vital
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.080]   signs.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   They estimated--
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.800]   This is so gruesome.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:40.440]   It's a morbid-- they estimated that she would die during her stay.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.760]   The chances she would die during her stay were 9.3%.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.880]   And like I said, Google said 19.9%.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.800]   So I guess in that respect, Google wins.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   But--
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.800]   Right.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.800]   You don't like--
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.800]   So what?
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   I mean--
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.800]   Well--
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.800]   What are they doing with that prediction?
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   Oh, that's where the death panels we talked about earlier in the minute.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   That's where the death panels we talked about earlier in the minute.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   It's like ever the good chicken tonight.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   Well, I mean--
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   If someone's going to talk to give them a bath--
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.800]   Only one cello for Martha tonight.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.800]   Why waste your last--
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.800]   Why waste--
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800]   No.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.400]   Could jello on somebody who's going to die.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.120]   But only 19% chance.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.120]   That's the problem.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   I don't get this.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.120]   Wait a second.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.120]   Wait a second.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   Wait a second.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.120]   I'm going to go back to Google messages.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   Yes, Andrew, messages.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.720]   So I have my iPhone message on it.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.040]   I have my phone phone message on my AT&T phone.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.200]   The message app on both of them has the same messages.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.200]   Good.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.800]   Maybe it is doing that then.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.840]   So I don't know how, but it's under my account--
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840]   --of my name.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:51.840]   Yeah, that would be--
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.480]   Account-based going through that phone.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.480]   So I think that's what it's doing.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.480]   I could be wrong.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.800]   I could be very, very wrong.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.640]   And I'll stand corrected if it is.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:04.400]   So you can also send GIFs, GIFs, and GIFs, if you wish.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.680]   There's a GIF search.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.520]   There's a GIF search.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.000]   I call them GIFs.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.160]   There's a Yif search built in.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.560]   I'm going to call it Yifs.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560]   No?
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.760]   No, Yif is a good.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   It's good.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   That's how the Greeks say it.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.760]   Yif?
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.240]   Is that a bad word?
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.120]   No, you're just going to add fire to this debate.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   Really?
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.120]   It's a bad word.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.600]   In what language is it a bad word?
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.520]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.960]   It's a furry.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.000]   Apparently, Karsten speaks the furry tongue.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:37.440]   Oh, my god.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.680]   Is it something in furry?
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.680]   Apparently.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.880]   I'm not going to Google this.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520]   No Googling.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520]   Nobody Google this.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.120]   Don't go to Urban Dictionary.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.920]   OK, so I can't call it that.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.640]   Yif?
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.360]   Can I call it Yif?
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.440]   OK, so you can send these little pictures that loop.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.120]   Yes, you can send little looping pictures.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.680]   This is the one reason I want to use it.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.320]   Smart Reply.
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.400]   That's the thing that they do on Google Mail as well,
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.120]   the smart reply.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.040]   So somebody texts you and says, where are you?
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.720]   And then you could push a button that says,
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.520]   be there soon or on my way, which would be great.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520]   Oh, yes.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.000]   I have been doing that.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.520]   You have that already in--
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520]   I have that in my--
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.520]   Not in the address.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.520]   You're on the phone.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.520]   Yes.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.840]   Preview links within the conversation.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.480]   This is part of that rich communications services.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480]   I'm sure RCS.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.560]   Oh, I was looking in the wrong place to see if I have it.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.040]   You have to go to the web.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040]   I was looking on the mobile--
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.320]   Yeah, you're doing your browser.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.760]   You're doing your browser.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   And then you're going to talk about it.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.320]   But you have to go-- no, your mobile app has to have--
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.520]   under the top right menu, it has to have--
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.520]   which it didn't have for me earlier today.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.520]   Oh, it has to say--
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.520]   It doesn't have this.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520]   OK.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520]   Messages for web.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   OK, don't show my screen.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.080]   And you hit that and take a picture of the QR code.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.600]   OK, on your phone, open Messages.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.200]   Tap the More menu.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200]   Select Messages for Web.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.200]   Well, we couldn't--
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.200]   And I don't have it yet.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.200]   OK.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.200]   Oh, I did have it.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.200]   I thought maybe not.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.200]   OK.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.200]   Yeah, so you have to be updated.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.200]   And that's the--
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.200]   Got it.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.200]   That all goes down to whether Google feels you're worthy.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.040]   I am not worthy, but I knew that.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.040]   Weirdly not worthy.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   Google stuff.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.960]   I love it, but it does not love me.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.960]   It does not.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:31.760]   OK, well, if this is all true, then all you need to do Google is make an iOS version.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.360]   And I will be happy.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.520]   Then I will-- then I will be happy.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.760]   I like their tip on this.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.400]   To save your mobile data, stay connected to Wi-Fi.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.160]   I searched Google.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.400]   Google Messenger for iOS.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.760]   First response, Google Aloe.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   Oh.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.560]   I can't figure it out.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.760]   They just-- they do offer Aloe an iOS and Hangouts.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.600]   I just-- I don't understand.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.520]   I understand.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.640]   What version of messages again do we have to have?
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.640]   [SIGH]
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   Dora boss.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.640]   What's this?
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.040]   So you click in-- you want to help, and you click the login to messages for web, and that's
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.040]   what I get.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040]   That's where it takes me to.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.040]   Now you go to messages.google.com.
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.840]   If that's in the help file, you click on this.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.840]   This is where it takes you to--
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.600]   That's not even a Google page.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.120]   That's some weird page.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.560]   Don't-- whatever you do, don't click on that.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.520]   Don't do it, Burke.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.520]   Don't you do it.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.360]   I don't know.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.160]   I don't know if I care even.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.640]   You can no longer book Uber rides and Google Maps.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640]   What do you think that's all about?
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.840]   Why do they take-- they just announced that that was going to be in there?
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.840]   Yeah, I don't get it in there.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:44.840]   No explanation.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.440]   Unless they're planted by Lyft or something.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.440]   I don't know.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.920]   Maybe they're-- maybe they're against-- well, either planning to buy Lyft or they're against
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.560]   bad self-driving cars.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.160]   Maybe they're going to make Waymo the link.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.160]   You know, Waymo-- isn't it?
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.880]   Waymo just bought 20,000 Jaguar ePaces.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.880]   20,000.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.680]   Cheese.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.680]   Cheese.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.080]   That sounds like a pretty big rollout.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.280]   And those are nice cars.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280]   Yeah, that's--
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.280]   Those are nice cars.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.520]   They can't even get it yet in the US.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.760]   We're going to get one for review.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.080]   Well, they're advertising it, but I think it's soon to be in the US.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:26.560]   They're introducing the Waymo Jaguar self-driving eyepace.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.000]   Well, eyepace, not ePace.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   Eyepace.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   OK.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   So--
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   They're going to use them--
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   They ordered up to--
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   It's a little bit of a--
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.400]   Up to $20,000-- or $20,000 of them.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.760]   This was announced back in March, though.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.960]   So that's for, quote, public testing.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.000]   That has a really public.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.320]   So maybe that's the plan, right?
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.160]   By the end of 2018, maybe they took it out--
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.120]   Or Uber out because they're going to put Waymo in.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:53.640]   OK.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.640]   Waymo better.
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   But let's see here.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.000]   Oh, wait.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.080]   This says they're adding 62,000 FCA minivans to their fleet, too.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.880]   Yeah, they're growing this thing.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.120]   Yeah, it sounds like they're getting ready to go into a city.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.720]   It was ready.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:10.400]   It's fleet.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.800]   And we're going for a fleet.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.600]   Which was so--
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.400]   Hey, how many cars do you need?
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.360]   If this car-- if you call it and it pulls up
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:22.680]   and there's nobody in the car, you'd probably feel better, right?
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.640]   I would hop in.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.160]   No questions asked quite literally
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.520]   because there'd be no one to ask.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.440]   So I do it.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:31.840]   And I videotape the whole thing.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.720]   I'd be like, hey, guys.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.680]   And you wouldn't be nervous.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.800]   No, why would it be nervous?
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.080]   Because it might crash.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:39.600]   OK.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:40.520]   Any-- I'm much more nervous.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.680]   I'm sure the boys would drive it by--
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:42.480]   Actually, you're right.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.320]   It's much worse.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   And--
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   And--
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   And--
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.520]   Well, I had you for--
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.200]   I would be more worried about it going slowly
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.120]   and never getting to my destination quite honestly.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.480]   It'd be like, dear, god go, buster.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:53.840]   Right.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.920]   And you can't say faster.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.320]   You can.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:56.920]   I just won't listen.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.280]   I got 100 bucks for you if you could get there in five minutes.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:01.800]   Nothing.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.560]   So--
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:03.040]   What?
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:03.840]   The best part?
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:04.480]   For me?
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.720]   I don't have to have a conversation with a stranger.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:07.560]   I know.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.720]   I know.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.160]   So Jeff, I'm surprised at that.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.680]   That is like journalism 101.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.240]   That's why I am-- that's what I have a purpose.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:20.360]   I don't know what it's going to believe this, but I am shy.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.920]   I am shy and I'm an introverted,
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.680]   but I make it myself.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.120]   Oh, I'm actually taught me this.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.600]   And it's good.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.840]   Talk to somebody any time I can talk to someone
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.640]   who I don't normally talk to.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.080]   Talk to them.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:32.840]   I do.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.000]   And then what do you learn?
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.400]   And all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.680]   I mean, sometimes you just make a connection
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.480]   with another person.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.440]   Sometimes you're like, my god, why did
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.600]   I start this conversation?
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.560]   But sometimes you learn really interesting things.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.240]   I mean, about the city you're visiting,
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.440]   maybe it's about a problem.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:51.360]   Like, I've always asked--
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.880]   I always ask people about lately, it's been like,
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.760]   oh, how do you feel about Uber and Austin?
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   Right.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.120]   Which do you care about?
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.000]   We do ask that, yeah.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.800]   It's George Burns said it.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.160]   Remember that?
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.320]   George Burns.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.960]   He said it's a shame that the only people
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.280]   know how to run the country are driving cabs and cutting hair.
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:11.360]   So I know you're shy, Jeff, but you know what?
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.800]   I challenge you to do that.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.320]   Because--
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.440]   No, I agree with you, but--
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:18.040]   I'm going to tell the students to do that.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.200]   Sometimes-- no, I'll do it in all times, places.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.960]   I'll talk to flight attendants.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.560]   I'll talk to people.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.000]   But sometimes--
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.360]   I want to be the one to choose.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.560]   And sometimes you get in a car.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.640]   And so one of my phobias in life when I was a child
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.040]   was the haircut.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.240]   Because the barber was going to say--
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:38.840]   I've talked about them.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.080]   --how about them cubs?
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.040]   And I didn't know anything about the cub because I wasn't a real man.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:48.160]   I did a podcast on whether it was acceptable to wear earbuds
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:48.600]   during--
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.120]   No.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.240]   --what you're getting your haircut or--
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.880]   No, it is the height of Brutus.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   All you have to do is say, I'm not feeling very social today.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.920]   Would you call into that podcast so I can add your voice?
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.320]   Oh, that's more awkward by far.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.720]   No, it is not more awkward.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.120]   People appreciate that.
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:03.960]   I'm not kidding.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:04.840]   I am an introvert of her--
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.840]   How do you know they're afraid of talking to you then?
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.720]   No, just-- and you say it nicely.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.920]   You're like, they'll be like, whoa, so it's super hot lately.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.040]   And you're like, yeah, I'm not feeling super social today.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.880]   Do you mind if I just look at my phone
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.120]   or if I just sit here?
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.400]   Well, if you just wear earbuds, you
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.760]   don't even have to have that conversation.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:28.120]   But that is negating them as being worthwhile to you as a person.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.400]   That is the most dismissive thing you could do.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.080]   Their worst to me is cutting my hair.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.000]   That is insulting.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.720]   Well, I asked my hand.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.160]   You might as well have a robot.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.400]   I asked Candace, who, by the way, I do talk to you
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.040]   every time because she gives me great tips on how
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.840]   to get my wife to like me.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.920]   And she said it's OK with her.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.400]   She said, I do not mind when people wear earbuds.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.080]   OK, yes.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.840]   You can ask someone.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.840]   But I even hate when people go through the checkout line
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.280]   of things, talking on their cell phone.
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:01.440]   I think that is a failure to acknowledge the person who
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.640]   is in front of you at this moment.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.160]   I think it's the height of rudeness.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.480]   And I hate people.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:13.920]   That's what-- so I asked this on my Leo on the Line podcast,
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:18.120]   Lottle, which turns out it stands for lesbians on the loose.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.000]   I didn't know that.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.840]   I did not realize that.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.640]   And I got a lot of feedback because it's a calling show.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   That's Leo on the line.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.040]   He's Leo on the line.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.920]   And-- or whatever.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.240]   And Guy called up and said, well,
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.680]   in my community, I'm African-American.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.520]   In my community, the barbershop is
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.120]   where you find out everything that's going on in the community.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.600]   So you know we wouldn't want to wear headphones.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.000]   I don't know.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.240]   I think people--
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.760]   yeah, you know what I think.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.720]   I've said it.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.760]   I want you to know what you think about this.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:57.040]   A new phone from Oppo.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.560]   This is OPPO.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.720]   They are a Chinese company.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.120]   They actually were kind of the spinoff is OnePlus.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.320]   But Oppo still makes phones.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.200]   In fact, they're one of the biggest sellers.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:09.280]   In China, they're making a phone.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.800]   So the new metric-- you should know this--
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.560]   for smartphones is what percentage of the front face is
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.080]   screen.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.520]   Up to now, 91% has been the highest anybody can get.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.680]   This one is 93% because--
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.040]   look at this.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.000]   The camera pops up.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.920]   There's no notch.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.960]   The camera pops up.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:35.960]   Front and back.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.800]   Does it turn on instantly?
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.160]   There's no delay.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:39.800]   That'd be nice.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.040]   They say, well, I can show it to you.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.960]   This is a verge video.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.240]   I ordered one.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.160]   They say that it's so fast because there's no fingerprint
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:50.360]   reader.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.280]   You have to do face recognition that it
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.560]   does the face recognition in half a second.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.920]   See, that's how fast the camera launched.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.000]   Did you see that?
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.080]   It was pretty quick.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:00.760]   This is the Oppo.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.240]   Do you get to get the camera to launch?
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.720]   You have to go to the screen and do that?
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:04.400]   Is it on no button?
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.600]   You swipe up.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.840]   Or there's a camera button.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.880]   Oppo's new Find X was announced in Paris yesterday.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.440]   It combines-- it's a 6.4-inch display
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:20.280]   in a regular size phone because it's 93.8% screen.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.240]   And it can do the face--
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.720]   by the way, 25 megapixel front-facing camera
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:30.000]   with 3D scanning system, 16 megapixel and 20 megapixel
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]   dual rear camera.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.520]   The other thing is no camera bump
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.520]   because it goes slides right into it.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.120]   No stupid notch.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:37.280]   No notch.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.800]   No stupid notch.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.400]   No stupid notch.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.600]   The camera can open in just half a second.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.480]   So you swipe up.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.560]   It recognizes you and then it goes away.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.680]   And here for privacy nuts is another nice feature.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.880]   The camera's covered when it's not in use.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.320]   Interesting, OK?
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.120]   Look at that.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.480]   It is tough though.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.360]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.200]   Someone said it was tough to put a case on that, which--
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.680]   Yeah, case makers are just going to--
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.520]   Dedicated case person.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.640]   Yeah, maybe not good for a case.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.040]   And mechanical parts.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.200]   Right.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.840]   You're bringing up all the potential problems.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.560]   But I love things that click.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.400]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.840]   I love things that pop up.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.120]   Yeah, you don't slide it up too.
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.520]   It's a little motor.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.200]   Ooh, that's another sign of--
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.040]   [GROANS]
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.960]   Another thing that could go wrong.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.480]   Yeah, it sure is.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.520]   I just like seeing innovation in this space
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.800]   because everybody else slavishly copies Apple.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:36.800]   So--
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.080]   Although I think that screen percentage,
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.160]   that's kind of a silly metric.
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:43.600]   I do not want to live in a world where now I'm going to have
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.400]   to suddenly memorize percentage of your face that is screen.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.080]   I'm like, oh, really?
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.400]   Ask your barber.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:51.920]   Kill them.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.480]   Ask them what?
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:03.280]   The iPhone is 82.9% screen.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.120]   I'm telling you, it's completely a metric.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.600]   No, let's not make this happen.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.440]   Yes.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.600]   That's going to be the new metric.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.160]   Too late.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.640]   It's already happened.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:17.880]   Oh, you wrote about this, Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.280]   Amazon is putting echoes in hotel rooms.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.640]   There are already hotels doing this.
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.520]   But this is a specially designed echo for hotels.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.680]   I think this might be really great.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.040]   I think this is really awesome.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.040]   Ask it for room service, request housekeeping,
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.960]   play music, of course.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.360]   It's called A-word for hospitality.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.560]   And it will be distributed on an invitation basis
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.880]   to hotels, vacation, rental spots, and other locations.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.640]   The Marriott hotels, Weston hotels, St. Regis,
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.960]   Loft, an autograph collection hotel starting this summer.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.840]   There have been hotels like the Win Las Vegas
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.320]   who've had this before, but they weren't just the regular
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.720]   everyday echo.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.240]   You can ask it.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.640]   They were the regular everyday echoes,
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.560]   but there was actually a lot happening on the back end
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:06.880]   to make them work in the hotel rooms.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:07.720]   Just so you know.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.600]   Because that's a new person every time
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.800]   somebody checks in and checks out.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.920]   Well, no, the wind does it a little bit differently.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.560]   Oh, OK.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.000]   This one, it's kind of like creating a blueprint for the hotel.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.080]   But there's a bunch of parameters.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.080]   You can order room service.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.040]   I mean, I love it.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:26.120]   You could say echo, can you get me a ham and cheese
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.640]   on rye and a bottle of pop?
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:31.640]   And or because I say that.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.800]   Wow, that's a pop.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.120]   It'll come back and say you apparently are over 70 years old.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:42.560]   You can say what time does the hotel pool close?
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.320]   Where the fitness center is.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.280]   You know what's going to happen?
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.080]   It's like it's like a new hotel room, which I do often.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.040]   And you and OK, what channels am I some BC?
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.280]   And they don't give you the list anymore.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:52.600]   Love to have.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:53.680]   So you got to go through everything, right?
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.160]   Love to have that.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.120]   And so what will happen when all what will happen now is that is
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.200]   that is that is that best he'll go in the room and and you've taught
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:00.760]   her how to use it.
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.160]   But you won't know what the commands are.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.160]   You'll end up with this huge catalog of commands.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.720]   You might as well pick up the phone.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.840]   Well, wait, wait.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.120]   So I don't know if you guys have done this.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.200]   But if you go into Amazon today, you can create a blueprint
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.400]   and one of the blueprints for house guests.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:17.560]   So this is a similar.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.800]   So go to Amazon.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.040]   I think it's dot com slash blueprints or something.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.920]   So I've actually done this in our house.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.420]   And you basically in yes, you do have to ask Madam
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:29.320]   of the questions or have the right syntax.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:35.240]   But you actually put in a lot of syntax when you're get your mind out
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.000]   of the gutter, man.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.120]   So when you so like when I did it, I was like, how do I turn on the lights?
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.840]   How do I change the temperature?
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:47.880]   I tried like, you know, how do I change the thermostat?
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:51.560]   Like all of these variations of things that my guests I figured would want
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.120]   to know.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.480]   And this is very similar.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.480]   So you'll probably have a list of a couple commands like that.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.400]   I mean, but you already have that in hotels today.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.080]   You have those fat books, right?
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.240]   That you get and you're like, OK, just looked up, Yif.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:14.280]   The new Alexa for hospitality will link to your Amazon account.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.160]   If you want, you'll be able to go in your Echo settings,
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.680]   say I want to when I'm going to be staying at that hotel,
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.280]   just here's my music, here's all of that stuff.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.680]   So it would know I could say read to me and it would know my audible book
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.440]   and would read to me.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.400]   I think this is going to be.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.720]   So that's but that's not there yet.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.280]   And there's a couple of things we should know.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.760]   One, every time every I think it's at the end of every day,
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.040]   possibly every state, they're going to reset.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.840]   So you don't have your old commands.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.280]   They go away.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.720]   The hotels don't get the data.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.800]   They don't get the voice data.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.200]   Amazon is very particular about that.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.840]   Of course.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.040]   They will get metrics like how many percentage of people who
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:54.560]   accessed room service through this device, for example.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:57.920]   The one more way I don't have to talk to people.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.920]   There you go.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.040]   And those so tying it to your personal account, they're not offering that yet.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.280]   Marriott was the first company to actually tie your Netflix account.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.440]   In your hotel room and that integration actually took so long.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:17.840]   I talked to Marriott when they did it and the amount of time and effort for
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.040]   like authenticating and the deauthenticating was incredible.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.200]   So if anyone's going to be able to do this well, it's going to be Marriott,
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.920]   but it is a time consuming thing.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.720]   Marriott's now gigantic because it also includes Starwood.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:33.800]   The merger, the purchase.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.360]   Si.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.920]   I'm a Marriott person.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:38.880]   So I'm fine.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.240]   I'm a starboard person.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.640]   I was a starboard person.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.720]   We're now together in one big.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.920]   I don't like staying at Mariots.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.360]   I don't like that.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.000]   And you're neither.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:49.640]   And yeah.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.280]   OK, we know why.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:53.200]   So anyway, you don't need to tell us.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:44:00.960]   What else?
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.280]   What else?
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:04.880]   So we will make fun of Pixel board cutting windows.
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.520]   No, it's good news.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.520]   What is the good news?
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.960]   You get censored right now.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.840]   It's a choice.
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:15.400]   You get any information from Nigeria.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.160]   Listen, no, listen, don't stop it.
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.840]   This is good.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:25.640]   This guy gave $110,000 to a Nigerian prince.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:30.280]   Boy, if you get any information from Nigeria, ignore it.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.720]   He's got a lesson.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.960]   Look, yeah.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:37.480]   He took part in the Nigerian Prince scam for several years.
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:40.120]   Mortgage, remorgages, three times.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.600]   These times.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.240]   Wired, the guy, 110.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.080]   $2,500 at one whack.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.840]   Wired him $110,000 over time.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.240]   He thought he was going to get $64 million
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.840]   from the Nigerian government.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.080]   At one point, he was asked to travel to the airport
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.600]   in Wichita to meet a man with two chests of cash.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.400]   And I started looking for him.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:04.000]   Guess what, Fred?
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.240]   Never showed up.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.240]   What?
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.200]   And I started asking why.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.240]   We cannot mock this man.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.720]   Where's my cash?
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.560]   Oh, I know.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.080]   But all.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.000]   We all, it's sad, but we all know people who, for whatever reason,
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.280]   are down on their luck or just they want to believe in this.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.680]   Oh, no, no, no, it's even the Niagara Falls grandparent scam.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.400]   Do you ever hear that one?
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:26.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:29.760]   Let me finish this though, because there's a happy ending to Fred's story.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.320]   No, there is.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:30.680]   There is.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.680]   He got his money back in his settlement with the Department of Justice,
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:39.560]   Western Union admitted it knew that some of its employees had conspired with scam
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:46.120]   artists. They set aside $586 million of fun to refund victims across the US and
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:51.240]   Canada, and they were able to get Fred's $110,000 back.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:53.680]   Most people don't know about this fund.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.160]   So if you do know anybody, if you do have an uncle or an aunt who did this,
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.880]   for God's sake, let them know.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:45:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.720]   He had saved every receipt and every email.
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.400]   He sent the numbers to the Attorney General's office.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.560]   Each was confirmed.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:14.320]   He was granted a $65,000 refund, then he found another box of receipts, got the rest.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:20.560]   So 344 victims have claimed a total of $1.7 million in refines.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.680]   That's a lot left in that fund.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.960]   There's still a lot left.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:28.760]   It all started for Fred with his email, Yahoo email box in 2005.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:31.280]   He actually thought he got a...
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.560]   He got to the point, he said, where they were showing me that the president of Nigeria had
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.960]   sent me a letter, it had his picture on it and everything.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.360]   I looked it up on the computer to see what the Nigerian president looked like, and it was him.
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:50.640]   He got an email from Robert Mueller, FBI Director Robert Mueller, supposedly.
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.680]   His code name was B-Dog.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.920]   It was signed with the FBI's official seal and address.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:03.600]   And Mueller told him, "I wish you can remove doubt and suspicious and go ahead.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.800]   I assured you that you will never regret this fund release because Mueller's famous for
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.080]   his fractured syntax."
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.640]   Boy, if you get any information from Nigeria, ignore it.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.360]   This has been a problem for a long time, even before 2005.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:25.840]   There was like the 440 scam or something, because it's a well-known scam even before the
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.240]   internet.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.280]   This was a...
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.000]   So that was the Kansas City Star story.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.480]   Really actually a great story about him getting his money back.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.600]   Now you go ahead.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:38.960]   I just wanted to set up.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.600]   He breaks your heart that he mortgaged his house three times.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.480]   It just breaks your heart.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.280]   Oh, poor guy.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:43.760]   I just...
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:46.480]   I look at him and I see so many people who...
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.280]   Our relatives.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:51.040]   Not just relatives, but anybody who's just...
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:54.320]   Life sucks for them and they're hopeful because this is...
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.680]   It's a way...
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.240]   I mean, it's easy to...
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.520]   I don't know.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.240]   It's not even desperation necessarily.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.160]   It's just gullibility to...
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.840]   Sometimes it's beyond...
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.320]   Oh, we wish.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:04.960]   It's greed.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.720]   That's true too.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.440]   Yes, that's true.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.000]   Yes.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.520]   The con man will say,
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:11.520]   "I don't take advantage of anybody.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.800]   I take advantage of their greed."
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.800]   Yeah, but...
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.160]   The night before...
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:16.720]   I don't think it's crazy.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.040]   It was one.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.520]   The grandparent one is...
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.160]   And my father got hit with this, but he didn't...
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:24.000]   My mother and we stopped him.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.240]   But he was just so nervous that...
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:28.000]   That high grandpa...
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.320]   And don't even call him grandpa.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.600]   Call him something different.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:34.080]   But he believed that Jake was in trouble somewhere.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.800]   And it's a random call you call him.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.240]   Somebody in Florida.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.600]   Chances aren't grandparent.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.280]   Chances aren't they have grandchild.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.280]   Okay, let's make it better as a son.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.720]   And then grand son.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:45.920]   And then boom, there it goes.
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:46.720]   And all these...
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.240]   No clues gotten, right?
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.640]   He doesn't call you grandpa.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.600]   Never said his name.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.520]   You know, da da da da.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.880]   But he was ready to go to Walmart.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:55.600]   Why are some money?
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.120]   Because he was not greed.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:58.640]   He thought he was helping his grandson.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.400]   Yeah, that's common.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.080]   There's a lot of people who prey on people.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.560]   Like I lost my phone overseas.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.360]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:05.840]   Oh yeah.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.640]   Send me money.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.680]   Send me this.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.840]   I just barely stopped my ex-wife from doing that.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.360]   Because she got an email.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.200]   It was very credible from our gardener.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.560]   Who said, "I'm in Europe.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.440]   I lost my wallet.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.800]   I hate to do this.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.760]   But I can't get home if you could just wire me some money.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.560]   So I can get home.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:22.080]   I'll of course pay you back."
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.680]   And it was signed by our gardener.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.720]   And what had happened is somebody had broken into his Yahoo account.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.520]   Right.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.800]   Read all his mail, got his name, got his business and all that.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.200]   Then sent emails to all the people in his address book.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:37.840]   And although I got one not that long ago,
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:40.720]   that was like, I know that this is part of a scam,
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.400]   but this is really not a scam.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.840]   You know, it was like, well, it was very convincing.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.160]   It sounded a lot like my friend.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.600]   So then I had to go and I was like,
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:50.400]   that's what makes it correct.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:54.560]   Even there, but a quick Facebook check showed me that they were not there.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:00.160]   What I really feel for is all those Nigerian princes
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.000]   who actually are trying to get money out of the country.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.960]   Because it's very hard to convince anybody.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.760]   No, there's nobody.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.120]   There is nobody.
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:09.920]   That's not real.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.760]   That's not real.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.200]   Crypto kitties.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.400]   Here's some shot in Freud.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.320]   Wait, is this a scam?
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.400]   Oh, I wouldn't say it's a scam.
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:21.760]   I think they're very straightforward.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:27.280]   Crypto kitties, which was, I kind of regret not playing it now.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.480]   It was a virtual kitty.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:32.560]   You would buy kitties.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.880]   They could breed and create new unique kitties,
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.080]   which you could then sell.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.840]   And that's of course, speculators jumped on it.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:40.000]   It was based on blockchain.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.200]   Must be good.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.120]   It was one of the world's first blockchain games.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.720]   And they raised some money.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.080]   And Reese and Horwitz and Union Square Ventures in March gave them $12 million.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.480]   For digital collectibles.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.400]   Unfortunately, it was a little bubbly.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.960]   The number of crypto kitties transactions decreased in June by 98%.
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:00.640]   Cheese.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:04.160]   And it's now gone down to virtually zero.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:07.600]   Although Mr. Crypto Kitty says,
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.640]   "You can't measure it by the number of transactions that happen in a month."
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:15.600]   People are holding their crypto kitties.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.240]   And the price has gone down.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:20.800]   The average price is about $5 per digital cat.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.960]   All-time medium high $41.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:26.320]   But we heard about people selling cats for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.280]   Which reminds me,
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.520]   as I've had conversations about this lately.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:35.680]   Can one of you geniuses explain ICOs to me and tokens?
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:35.920]   Sure.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:37.760]   And do it.
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.200]   Stacy could do that really well.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:44.800]   That was mean.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:47.200]   I can explain what the blockchain is.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.640]   I cannot explain tokens.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:49.440]   You can do the blockchain.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.080]   I'll do tokens.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:50.560]   Blockchain.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:50.960]   Is there something?
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:51.520]   Blockchain I guess.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:51.840]   There is.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.640]   I'll tell you one of the reasons I can answer this is,
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.120]   yesterday I read the most pointless article I've ever read in Wired magazine.
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:04.160]   It must have been 50,000 words about an ICO scam that never,
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.120]   it just never ended.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.440]   But I read the whole dang thing.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:13.120]   If I understand the ICO and the token and the fiat currency.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:13.600]   Yes.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.320]   Okay.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.200]   So that's your assignment.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:17.680]   I can, you know, you want me to do this Stacy?
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.240]   You can just.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:19.920]   You can explain the ICOs to them.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.680]   We can do it together if you want.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.040]   I'll start with fiat currency.
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.000]   Then you can do blockchain.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.440]   Oh, I could take fiat.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.560]   We'll do fiat then.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.160]   It has to start with fiat.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.960]   So currency based on like an actual.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:35.440]   Belief.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.280]   Thing of value versus.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:37.840]   Well, okay.
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:41.680]   So I start with we used to be on the gold standard and then.
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:42.080]   Random.
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.280]   Eventually we moved to fiat.
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:44.160]   Think about gold though.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:48.720]   The value of gold does not equal its actual value.
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:53.760]   The industrial value of gold is far lower than the price it sells for.
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:54.400]   Even gold.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.120]   You're going to go there.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:55.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.440]   No, even gold is a fiat currency.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:57.920]   Oh, wow.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.480]   It's a face.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:52:58.640]   Okay.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.040]   Right.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:00.160]   Okay.
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:00.640]   Okay.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.760]   Because so currency is a store of value.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.040]   Right.
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:06.720]   It's like a battery for value.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:07.840]   I mow your lawn.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.760]   There's two things you could do.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:13.040]   You could give me a loaf of bread that we've done longer.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.880]   A gift of the president yelling at you.
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:19.520]   Or you could give me a token of some kind that says,
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.120]   this is the value of that lawn mowing.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.520]   We pre-agreed that you will give me $5.
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:26.720]   That's a piece of paper that says $5 has Abraham Lincoln on it.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.480]   And that we've agreed that's roughly equivalent to the amount of energy I put into mowing.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.240]   And the only thing that's holding that up is faith.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:36.640]   Fiat.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:40.480]   Because the faith in the full faith and credit of the United States government.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:47.280]   So fiat currency is otherwise known as a liquid currency that people agree on.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.280]   It's agreed upon value.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:50.800]   It has no inherent value.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.640]   And Stacey, you're right.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:54.000]   Initially it was pegged to the gold.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.280]   But gold doesn't have that value either.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.760]   Because the industrial value of the of the metal,
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.080]   the base metal is nowhere near what the value was assigned.
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.600]   So even that was to some degree, it was a tangible thing.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.000]   It's like clam shells or cow re-shells.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:10.640]   Right?
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:11.280]   Right.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:12.960]   Okay.
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.080]   So that's what we've got.
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.040]   So that's what we've got.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.800]   And there's some backed by government, some not.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:19.120]   There's Bill's Dollars.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:22.240]   Bill the deli owner wants to buy a new deli.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.120]   Can't get a bank loan.
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:26.480]   So he puts out Bill's Dollars worth 80% of the value of a sandwich.
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.720]   You give me 80 cents on the dollar for a sandwich.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:30.880]   I'll give you a sandwich, 20% discount.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.480]   And you give me, you buy it.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.040]   And now I have cash to buy a new deli.
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:37.520]   People, it's actually happened.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:38.480]   People actually traded.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:40.800]   There's Canadian Tire as a store in Canada.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.760]   People were using their Canadian Tire currency as real currency.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.480]   Because as long as you all agree, this is some value.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.920]   That's a fiat currency.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:49.200]   That's the green stamps.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.560]   Green stamps, perfect example.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.720]   Okay.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.280]   Keep going.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.320]   Keep going, professors.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.440]   Now we get to blockchain.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:01.200]   Blockchain is a distributed ledger system.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:06.720]   So it's just a some, it's just a way to track something.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:08.960]   In computing.
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:14.960]   And the way you track it and the way it works is everyone has, well, you have to get a consensus
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:18.800]   to agree that this transaction has taken place and stored.
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:23.280]   And what happens, consensus is usually 51%.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.440]   I think it could be other things I don't know.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:33.520]   And to do, like to create like in cryptocurrencies to create these things,
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:36.080]   to create Bitcoins, etc.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.520]   You have something called proof of work.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.280]   And that is computing power.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.400]   You don't actually, that's not tied to blockchain.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.840]   Blockchain is just the distributed ledger aspect of it.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.040]   That was kind of really confusing.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:47.840]   Right.
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:48.960]   That's where you wanted to Bitcoin now.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.840]   You need some way when you, when we have financial transactions,
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:57.440]   you need some way of recording financial transactions, a ledger.
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.320]   Generally in the past, this has all been done in a centralized place, a bank.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:06.080]   If you, you know, you come to me and you buy it, buy something, I put it in my book.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.560]   And now we have a record of it, but it's centralized.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.240]   So blockchain was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious person or persons.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.440]   Initially with Bitcoin, the idea that you could create something that would be fully
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:25.040]   decentralized, a ledger that is fully decentralized, but contains an agreed upon truth.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.960]   So you don't have to have a central person, a bank or somebody keeping that ledger.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:35.040]   By the way, ledger could be a database, could be anything really, but it's all agreed upon.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.760]   And yeah, the proof of work is there's a lot of complicated math about why you do a proof of
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.760]   work and so forth.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.480]   But it could be, but so let's say it's done for a currency like Bitcoin.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.640]   So the ledger keeps track of who has what?
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.680]   If I buy something for you using Bitcoin, it's entered into the ledger.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.840]   The Bitcoin miner is not only creating new coins, and there's going to be a limit of 21 million
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:00.640]   Bitcoin, but there's so to avoid inflation.
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:04.000]   He's tried to figure out how to avoid a lot of the problems that all fiat currencies suffer.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.440]   But among other things, the miners not only create coins, but they also using their machines,
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:16.560]   doing all this mathematics, do the ledger, maintain the ledger.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:17.280]   And one of the problems.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:22.000]   And the crypto part of it, the security part of it as well.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.160]   Yeah, because what they're doing is factoring primes.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:27.040]   So they're doing math, hard math.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.080]   And the math gets harder, by the way, this is another good thing or interesting thing,
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:34.240]   Nakamoto did, he's made the math harder over time.
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:36.160]   I'm not sure.
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:38.240]   That's only for blockchain.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:40.240]   No, sorry, that's for Bitcoin.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.360]   Yeah, there's other ways of doing this.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.720]   So this is how Bitcoin does.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.000]   Okay, I'm so far so good.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:46.480]   I'm fine.
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:49.520]   Now I see you in tokens.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:58.560]   So along comes an alternative to Bitcoin called Ethereum, similar blockchain, similar idea,
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.320]   tries to solve some of the problems.
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:04.000]   Well, among other things, problems with Bitcoin are besides its huge volatility,
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.280]   which is a big problem.
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:10.400]   It's this transaction times slowed a lot and the cost of transactions have gone up a lot.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:13.920]   So people are trying to create new kinds of Bitcoin.
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.240]   Bitcoin really is funny because you can't change Bitcoin.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.120]   You can only fork it.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:23.280]   And you can't say, let's fix Bitcoin.
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.440]   It's been a real historically a problem with Bitcoin.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.880]   So there's some real problems built into it.
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:30.720]   And you can only make, you could fork it, create a different kind of Bitcoin.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.000]   So Ethereum was a different way of doing it to try to solve it.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:43.840]   The SEC has decided, by the way, that ICOs are in fact real financial transactions.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.840]   The idea is just like a stock offer.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:48.960]   It's just like those Frank's dollars, the Delhi dollars.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:53.200]   I've decided that I want to raise money for my business.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:59.120]   And what I'm going to do is I'm going to issue an ICO, initial coin offering.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:04.960]   And you will give me fiat government-backed fiat currency.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:08.400]   And I will give you this token that has some value in the case of Frank's,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:12.080]   Delhi, it's 80% of a sandwich, or it's a sandwich at a 20% discount rather.
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.880]   So it's a way of raising money.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:21.120]   Sometimes it's used, so companies like Telegram have raised, I think almost a billion dollars
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:26.480]   now with their Bitcoin, because they'd say that our Bitcoin, not Bitcoin, our currency,
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:30.240]   is for our ICO, but for our currency that we're going to use,
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:36.160]   we're going to create a currency, you will have those tokens will be translated into that currency
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:39.520]   for monetary exchange inside of Telegram.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:45.760]   So the idea is it's basically a way of raising money.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.280]   And there was some question for a while.
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:51.040]   And then how is ongoing value created? Why are you buying that?
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.360]   Other people think your token is...
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.000]   It's speculative market.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.160]   Well, it doesn't have to be speculative.
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:00.000]   If your token actually can be exchanged for goods and services that people want,
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.520]   then you're on your way to establishing a true fiat currency based on it.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:11.680]   So inside Telegram, if people really think it's worth while, then you can get things.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:15.600]   The problem with the token, in most cases, is it's a closed ecosystem.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.240]   So you have to want things within that closed ecosystem.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:22.400]   But for the rest of the world, you want to be able to take something out and get dollars,
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:23.520]   because that's how the question is worth.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:32.320]   And there's another problem with tokens, which is in many cases,
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:35.200]   the people who issue the tokens take the cash,
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.760]   take the real money, and disappear.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.880]   And you're left holding nothing.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:46.000]   Because if those tokens are never turned into anything of value,
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.920]   so last year, there were $6.5 billion worth of ICOs,
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.280]   hundreds of millions of dollars sometimes in just a few hours raised.
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:01.760]   The SEC is kind of dithered around about whether these are securities,
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.520]   but eventually decided there were securities.
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:07.200]   There may be going forward some regulation on this.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:12.000]   But there's been people who put money into these things and just the people disappeared.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:18.560]   So there's a much-vaunted, a lot of people who are really, really good involved in this,
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:21.120]   called SIVIL, which is a journalism platform.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.440]   I met one of the founders.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.040]   They're one of the people.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:25.600]   She's so free.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.960]   I've read the white paper three times.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.000]   They're going to raise a lot of money they say through an ICO.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.320]   So people are going to give money into their closed ecosystem.
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:39.280]   My money is sitting there now, exchanged for these tokens.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.040]   The presumption is that-
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:45.440]   Those tokens are going to let you buy credibility on certain journalists.
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:46.160]   I'm not kidding.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:49.200]   So right, but how the hell does that doesn't monetize?
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:55.040]   So in a lot of cases, you're thinking an ICO, you're thinking of it as a donation.
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.440]   In fact, for a while, a lot of the people in the ICO community said,
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.320]   "Yeah, if we call this a donation, we're off the hook."
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:03.840]   The SEC said, "No, that's not true."
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.400]   But that was their attempt to get around it,
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:08.800]   by saying, "No, you're not buying anything. It's a donation."
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.320]   So I get a token and I give it to Leo,
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.840]   because he can do a investigative journalism.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.360]   "No, you're not going to do it. I'll give it to Stacy."
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.160]   So I give him a Stacy.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.640]   I give you a token that had been worth $100.
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:22.240]   There's a market that could be worth $110,
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:24.000]   an hour, $19, an hour, whatever.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.960]   And you agree that you're going to do this wonderful story,
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.800]   because I've given you this money.
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:31.680]   And I've done good for the world.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:32.320]   I've done good for the world,
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.160]   because Stacy does the story of the world gets it.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:40.000]   But how was any additional value created such that there's an influx of real money into this
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.320]   beyond some measure of charity to start off with?
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.320]   Well, it just depends on how you structure it.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:47.840]   Yeah, that's the key thing when you're evaluating an ICO.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.480]   You have to decide if they're going to be able to get real money into their system,
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:03:00.000]   or build a system where your token has value to you for whatever good in service
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.560]   they're going to exchange for it.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:07.840]   So there are electricity icons that have happened where your token gets you electricity,
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:10.560]   which then you can say, "Oh, well, that's worthwhile,
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:12.800]   because otherwise I would spend actual money on that.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:14.800]   So great for electricity.
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:19.440]   For digital services, it's a little less clear for things like journalism.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.440]   I mean, they're eventually asking you to pay for journalism with real money.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:27.440]   So getting back to the old confidence games,
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.080]   there's a confidence game called an exit scam that is being played out now in
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.240]   ICOs where companies raise funds and disappear.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.280]   And there's a $9 million--
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:42.000]   The big pair I'm not suggesting that's happening in the case of civil at all.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:42.960]   No, no, no, no.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:43.840]   According to the best of people--
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.440]   But the median $9 million is lost each day in cryptocurrency scams.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.520]   It's very easy to fall into these.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:55.360]   Bitcoin.com news said $1.36 billion worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:59.600]   by fraudulent ICOs in the first two months of 2018.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:04.240]   But all this comes back to Fred and the new Norwegian crypto princes.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:06.640]   Norwegian. I say Norwegian. I'm a Nigerian.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.080]   Well, it is. It's a scam just like the Nigerian prince.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:11.440]   It's a potentially potentially.
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:13.200]   It is a Norwegian scam, yes.
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:17.600]   Do we really do all that just so you could say that since, Jeff?
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:18.720]   One of the reasons it's a great scam--
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.080]   No, I was trying to understand civil.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:23.680]   One of the reasons it's a great scam is because blockchain is basically anonymous.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:28.400]   So not only is it decentralized, so there's nobody regulating, it's anonymous.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:31.440]   So you can get away with this.
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.920]   It's anonymous, but trackable, isn't it?
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:34.800]   It is trackable.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.400]   It is trackable.
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:39.520]   I remember talking to agents at a conference.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:43.040]   It was a digital currency conference and these people were at the FBI and they were like,
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.640]   this is the best thing that's ever happened to us.
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:46.400]   I was like, OK, yeah.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.000]   Yeah, OK. It's anonymous.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.520]   But if there's leaks in the system or it's not well designed, it's not fully anonymous.
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.560]   You get a number.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:05:00.400]   Each party that the transaction has a basically anonymous number.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:04.960]   If it can't be tied back to you in some other way, then it's anonymous.
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:06.240]   But cash is anonymous too.
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:10.000]   I mean, it's not-- cash is totally anonymous, but there's plenty of cash tracking done.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.640]   Wozniak last February.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:22.960]   One of the founders of Apple said he lost seven Bitcoins through fraud using a stolen credit.
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:24.720]   You just lost them through bad memory.
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:30.080]   I lost them because I couldn't-- same amount, by the way, because I can't remember the password.
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.440]   No, they're not lost.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.080]   The cover story in July's Wired is all about this.
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:39.920]   It's actually-- it's very long, but it's an interesting read.
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:44.960]   There's maybe more personal details than I really needed, but inside the Crypto World's
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:48.640]   biggest scandal and it's all about an ICO.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.280]   Gone terribly, terribly wrong.
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.880]   But with the best intentions, this wasn't
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.080]   a case of a con so much.
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:58.240]   Good intentions gone wrong.
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.480]   Thank you very much.
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:04.240]   So now that I've had you explain that, last week you saw my problem with the peen cat.
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:05.760]   I got the camera.
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:06.640]   How did that work?
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:12.160]   Well, because the camera-- the cat peed on the cat's real motion detection,
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:15.440]   and so it freaked the cat out and ran away and then the cat batted it down.
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:19.520]   Okay, you go into the settings.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:20.560]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:26.000]   And hold on, really, is this happening?
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:26.560]   It is in this.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.040]   We're going to rename the show, "Splayed It to Jeff."
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.240]   That's all right.
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.800]   Windows Weekly is just playing it to Leo, so it all works out.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.160]   All right.
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:35.440]   BitTorrent got sold.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:36.000]   I'm sad.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.560]   BitTorrent got sold for $140 million.
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:40.880]   I like the brand got a lot of money out of that.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:41.680]   I'm sure he did.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:48.080]   I always want to say Bram Stoker, Bram Cohen, who founded Bitcoin.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:55.120]   Sold it to a blockchain startup of all people.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:00.880]   For cash, $140 million for fiat currency, government backed.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:06.240]   Yeah, I was about to say, you should stress that it is backed by the US government,
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:08.160]   because that's what makes our currency so exciting.
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:08.320]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:14.320]   Jeff, you go in, you look at the devices, the actual live stream,
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.080]   and then there's a little hamburger menu that says "More."
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:24.640]   Click on that, and then there's a motion tracking thing, and just click it, and it should turn it off.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:28.480]   And now, if it's lit up, is it on, and if it's dark, it's off?
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:30.080]   I think so.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.680]   I just pressed "yes" to an update, so now it's showing me the update progress.
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:38.800]   And now we're going to wrap this thing up, because we've gone on way too long.
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.720]   And Leo wanted to be done with us sooner.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.240]   We thought we'll be bored with us.
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:43.120]   No, we're good.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:43.760]   Leo wanted us.
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:45.040]   We're still within three hours.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:45.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.040]   We're still well under three hours.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:48.640]   In fact, you want to go on a little longer?
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.040]   No, no, I'm just now getting hungry.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:52.320]   What do you mean?
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.200]   Again, thirsty.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.800]   Pardon?
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.360]   What's dinner?
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.080]   What's dinner tonight?
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.840]   Oh, it's a terrible dinner.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:59.280]   It's the kale and quinoa salad.
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:00.720]   I don't like it, but my daughter does.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:01.760]   You know what I made?
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:04.000]   The fact that your daughter loves that is just freaky.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:10.640]   I, for the first time, she would like my chicken ticca masala with handmade NAND bread.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:12.320]   I would like that.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:15.840]   Buzzmottie rice, although I'm thinking of doing cauliflower rice the next time.
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:18.000]   Oh, you're so trendy.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:18.800]   I know.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.440]   I'm with it.
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:19.920]   I'm hip.
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:21.440]   It was delicious.
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:27.120]   That's what I'm having for dinner tonight, because I'm having leftovers.
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:28.240]   Microsoft News.
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:31.200]   Just what we needed on Android.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:32.800]   A new way to stay informed.
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:34.720]   There's an Android version.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:35.360]   Yes.
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:36.560]   iOS Android.
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:37.520]   It's always been Windows.
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.640]   I'm from Microsoft News.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:41.840]   Yeah, I've never been a huge fan.
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:42.960]   It's the old MSN.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.560]   Oh.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.960]   Yeah, I've got a friend who works there.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.800]   I've never been a huge fan.
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:51.120]   They've got a lot of traffic.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:52.560]   They have a lot of journalists, too.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:53.680]   I mean, it's a big newsroom.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.080]   Look, they do.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.320]   They do know what's, they pay, and they actually pay.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:56.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:58.080]   We need companies for stuff.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:58.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:00.000]   So I look up.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.040]   No wonder no one else knows about it.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:02.160]   Who's in the place drawer?
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.640]   Now on, now on Android, but that's not my pick of the week.
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:08.640]   Let's get Stacey's and I'll give you my pick of the week.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:10.240]   Well, we're already there.
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.480]   We're already picking up the week.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:13.120]   I already picked that.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.200]   I have two picks because I haven't tried either of them,
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.520]   but I feel like it's important to show people things.
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:18.080]   Okay.
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:20.560]   I don't know if there's value in that, but I feel like...
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:22.080]   No, it's like what's out there.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:22.880]   What's going on?
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:24.960]   What are the kids doing?
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.480]   In like next week or the week after
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:27.840]   where it's all follow up with you.
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:30.000]   But here is what I'm doing.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.640]   This is my husband's father's day present
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.880]   because our eye twinkle lights broke.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:35.920]   It's Sylvania.
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.120]   What is it?
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.960]   Connected garden spotlights.
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:39.840]   Oh, I like that.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:42.480]   So these are the mini RGB lights.
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.680]   They are Z-way or Zigbee, sorry.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:47.040]   So they need a hub.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.560]   I happen to have a hub.
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.320]   These were about 60 bucks on Amazon.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.240]   And if you need a hub,
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:54.400]   I can't remember how much the hub is
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:55.680]   because I didn't need it.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:56.640]   But I wanted to show you
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.800]   because they're a lot smaller than I thought they were.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:09:59.520]   Ah!
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:09:59.840]   Sorry.
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:03.760]   So here are the little lighting stakes
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.680]   that you're going to shove into the ground.
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.560]   Tadao!
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.680]   Each one.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:12.400]   And you can attach three of these strands together.
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:13.600]   There's six lights on.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.040]   No, there's nine lights on each strand.
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:17.120]   Are they solar or powered?
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:18.160]   No, they're powered.
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:19.040]   They're electric powered.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:19.520]   Nice.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:25.280]   So you get this cool high PV 65 rated outlet thing
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:27.680]   the outlets in the other box.
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:30.640]   And a cord that attaches.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:31.760]   And you can turn them colors.
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:33.360]   There is no true white on these
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:34.960]   because it's an RGB LED.
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:40.560]   So, you know, that's the thing to know about them.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:42.560]   But I'm really excited about them.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.960]   And he is too because he likes colored lights.
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:47.040]   So it's like here for your garden.
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:48.640]   It's here for your garden.
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:51.840]   Now he did just actually put out outdoor lights.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.280]   They're not there.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:55.920]   Launch them.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:58.000]   They're not going to be shipping till mid-July.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.960]   And those are not these though.
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.680]   These are designed to go like along a pathway.
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.760]   The hulets are two spots and two sconces, I believe.
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:08.880]   Nice.
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.080]   Stay safe.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:10.640]   I got a set.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:13.200]   I feel for your husband.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:14.880]   Oh, man.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:17.680]   You know, your honey.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.200]   I got you something for Father's Day.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:20.800]   It's an IO D fan.
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:26.480]   That'd be like, that'd be like, that'd be like me giving my wife
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:28.400]   an ICO token for journalists.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:28.880]   Yeah.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.440]   Yeah, right.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:31.440]   Honey, you're going to be rich.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:32.560]   I got something for you.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:36.000]   I bucked 20 in Canadian dollar money, Canadian Tire money.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:36.800]   Okay, Tire money.
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:37.280]   Look at that.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:39.040]   There's some real fiat currency.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.800]   There you go.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:41.280]   Look at that.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.560]   Is that, is that, uh,
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:44.000]   the tire McGregor there?
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.200]   Yeah, look, you see.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.160]   He's a nice Scotsman.
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:47.440]   That means this.
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:48.160]   What is something?
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.080]   Canadian tires are a great store because it's not just tires.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.920]   Not, yeah, far from it.
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:54.480]   Far from it.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:55.280]   It's got everything.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:55.920]   Yeah.
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:56.960]   And tires.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.960]   Stacy, you said you had two things.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:00.160]   Well, I'm going to ask you.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:02.560]   So I have a second thing that is not as picturesque,
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:04.240]   but I haven't even opened it yet.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:06.000]   So I'm very curious what it looks like.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:06.560]   This is the,
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:06.560]   Oh, I'm fine.
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:07.120]   I have not that.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:13.600]   This is the Delta Sink attachment that's going to make my sink,
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:16.720]   which is a capacitive touch Delta faucet in my kitchen.
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:18.160]   It's going to make it talk to me.
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.120]   Of course it is.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.160]   Hey, do not knock the capacitive touch.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.680]   Honey, how do you turn on the faucet in the kitchen?
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.440]   You just tap it.
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.280]   Just close the blind, honey.
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:31.840]   The faucet will come on next.
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.960]   You're going to talk to it,
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:34.800]   then you're just going to think you want water.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:36.320]   Tell us what happened.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.760]   And Amazon Echo speaking the same language.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.800]   Oh, no.
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:42.480]   I don't want to talk to my faucet.
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:43.920]   Oh, no, you do.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:45.680]   My husband actually wanted this.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:46.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:46.880]   You know why?
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:47.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:47.520]   You know why?
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.120]   Because your hands are dirty.
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:49.760]   Again.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:50.640]   Your hands are dirty.
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:52.720]   You've been digging in the garden to put those stupid,
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:55.280]   I mean, those great Sylvania lights in.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.400]   And your hands are filthy.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.000]   And you don't want to go hit the knob.
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:01.520]   I think we got to bring your husband up here and verify.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.480]   I've met Andrew.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:03.360]   He is a saint.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:04.880]   He must be.
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:07.920]   He's also very lucky man.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:08.640]   And a saint.
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:09.520]   He is indeed.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:09.840]   Yeah.
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:16.800]   But he wanted this because you can tell it to dispense two cups of water, for example.
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.200]   Oh, is it accurate?
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:19.840]   We don't know yet.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:20.560]   Accurate.
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:24.160]   Well, that's that's what we're going to dispense two cups of water at 120 degrees.
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:25.840]   You cannot give it.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:27.600]   You can only say warmer or cooler.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.160]   But you can also set programming.
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:33.520]   So I can fill my spaghetti pot to my preferred spaghetti pot.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:34.400]   Oh, that's great.
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:35.840]   And I can say, hey.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:36.800]   Oh, you too.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:37.600]   Oh, you too.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:38.160]   I'm sold.
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:40.880]   Ah, so it has to sort of flow.
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.000]   Is it like a flow?
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:42.240]   Okay.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:45.600]   It has a yes, it does.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.800]   Wow.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.840]   So this is just got it.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:50.880]   This is it.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.640]   Now the challenging is.
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:55.280]   You need to have a plug faucet next to your plug.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:55.760]   You do.
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:57.200]   You need to have a plug.
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:58.800]   Outlet underneath your sink.
[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:01.840]   I happen to have one because I have a garbage disposable or a display.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:02.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:02.480]   Of course.
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:03.680]   Most people do probably.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:04.240]   That's right.
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:05.600]   That's right.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:06.080]   So.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.600]   Yeah, you're going to have an everyone under your sink.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:08.800]   Yeah.
[02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:13.760]   So I can say, Madam A, ask Delta to turn on as Delta to turn off branding.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.440]   Ask it to dispense one cup.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:17.360]   Ask it to warm up water.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.880]   Ask it to fill bottle.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.800]   Feeling creative?
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:22.400]   Program your own custom commands.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:23.520]   Ta-da.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.560]   That's really cool.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.200]   Because you have like a 16 quart spaghetti pot or something and you just you just want it to fill up.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:29.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:33.280]   And this is me with all my pieces and parts.
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:34.320]   So I'm going to install this.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:36.720]   Are you you're not going to call a plumber?
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:38.560]   No, you don't need a plumber.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:41.840]   I've I've installed faucets before too.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:43.280]   So I'm not real worried.
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.560]   It's going to be fun.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:49.360]   Yeah, were you ordering one?
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:49.600]   No.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:50.720]   Good.
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:52.000]   I'll tell.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.400]   So next week I will be able to tell you guys.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:56.000]   I'll do a follow up on these items.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.520]   I might after her review next week.
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:59.280]   So there you go.
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.280]   Jeff, you have a number for us?
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:02.880]   I do indeed.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:11.120]   So slightly political, but when the stuff down Stacey Way was occurring on the border,
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:18.640]   a couple named Charlotte and Dave Wilner in San Francisco saw a picture of a two year old
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:23.040]   reminded them of their own two year old daughter and they started a fundraiser on Facebook.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:24.800]   Hoping to raise $1,500.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:31.200]   Five days later, it's now at 13 million.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:38.240]   When I put this link up this afternoon about 2.30 and it's now 6.30.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.000]   So, you know, a few hours ago, it was just 10 million.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.600]   So in the time of the show, plus a little bit, it's raised to $3 million.
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:48.000]   And it's for the.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.400]   It's to re and reunite parents and children.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:57.600]   Well, it's just it's to bond out people and to represent them in court.
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:01.360]   It's the refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services in Texas.
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:05.760]   I saw they did a Facebook live show answering all the questions about how they operate and what
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.840]   they do. Mark Zuckerberg has given.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:08.640]   Other people have given.
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.320]   But it's pretty amazing.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:13.840]   You can see, you know, when you when you want to yell about Facebook, when you want to say
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:17.680]   Facebook's awful, people can join together and they can do things that matter.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:19.280]   I saw this on Twitter.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.880]   Twitter. Well, okay. Jesus.
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:25.280]   But it pointed to a Facebook thing, right?
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:27.760]   To a Facebook thing. Stay safe.
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:32.080]   Now, I want to point out it says he's raised 13.4 million of 15 million.
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:33.840]   They had they have kept.
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:34.880]   Oh, they kept moving on.
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:35.760]   Yes.
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:38.240]   Because once you hit the goal, then it stops.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.840]   So they keep increasing the goal.
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:42.160]   So I mean, the sky's the limit on this.
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:42.720]   Keep going.
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:46.960]   And so by the way, just to just know, this is a good thing that happens on Facebook.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:50.640]   Well, unlike my European friends, it's not a scam on people's lives.
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.200]   People do real good things, which is why, by the way, as the headline says,
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.840]   scream about Facebook all you want, but the stock is at an all time high.
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:04.960]   Boy, this has to be more money than racist has ever received.
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:08.160]   By far in their entire.
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:09.360]   By far.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:14.480]   But but for things like bond funds, the number of cases being brought, the justice
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:17.520]   department, like 20% of the justice department cases are immigration cases.
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:20.720]   And the number, I can't remember, but it was like, you know,
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:27.680]   tens of thousands of cases last year, it's going to be more than 300,000 cases so far.
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:31.920]   So the number of cases that will require bond and legal help and so on,
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.320]   this money will, I'm sure be used.
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:35.200]   Okay.
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:37.360]   Hopefully.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:38.560]   There is a gender purpose.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:39.600]   Yeah.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:44.080]   You know, it's so funny because I saw that you donated and I had my finger on the
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.600]   button and I wait, I probably should.
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:46.480]   I know you wait a minute.
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:48.240]   I know I should read up on this.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.240]   I read up the Washington Post did a feature on it.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:51.440]   I read up other news on it.
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:51.520]   Okay.
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:53.200]   So I did the right thing.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:59.840]   Through races, the races serve 7,000 family members in attention last year.
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:01.920]   It is a legit charity.
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:02.560]   I can actually tell you.
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:03.600]   You're familiar with it.
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:04.560]   I am familiar with it.
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:07.440]   I have a friend who volunteers for it as a player.
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:08.800]   So it is a little bit.
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:09.360]   I let it go for a day.
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:11.040]   I let it go for a day.
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:11.600]   Yeah.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:11.840]   Yeah.
[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:16.160]   But you know, it's nice actually to have something you can do because I feel like a lot of
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:19.600]   a lot of what we do is holler.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:21.200]   Yeah.
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:21.920]   Exactly.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:24.320]   I'll change my picture on Twitter.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:24.560]   Yeah.
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:25.040]   Yeah.
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:29.280]   Speaking of charity, one last number, what the heck.
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.440]   So both Square and Twitter are about to double their stock value,
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:37.440]   making the combined company's worth more than Tesla.
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:41.680]   So they last when Jack sat down.
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:42.160]   Wow.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:47.040]   Square, Square, and the breakup both get 100% gains this year.
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.920]   The firms are now worth more than 62 billion combined,
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.520]   says Bloomberg, surpassing the market value of Tesla.
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:56.320]   They laughed at Jack, laughed no more.
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:56.640]   Wow.
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:57.760]   Very nice.
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:01.440]   My mind is a little more self-serving.
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:06.320]   There's an Android podcast app in town.
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.960]   And actually, it's early days yet.
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.000]   And goodness knows, there's a lot of podcast apps we recommend podcasts, among others.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.480]   But if you use this, basically, I think a window into Google podcasts.
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:28.080]   If you're interested in subscribing, pick a podcast that you like and you want to listen to
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:29.040]   on a regular basis.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:32.160]   Maybe something like, I don't know, this week.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:33.440]   The IoT podcast?
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:34.560]   Oh, there you go.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:35.440]   Oh, there you go.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:37.360]   I am teasing you.
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:38.160]   There you go.
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.400]   No, because I already subscribed to this week in Google.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:42.320]   Chanting with Chuck, no.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.880]   No, you have to say the internet.
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:45.680]   I found it.
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:46.720]   I found it.
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:47.280]   It's the same.
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:48.480]   I searched for Twig.
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:49.440]   Didn't find it.
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:50.480]   Yeah, search for Twig.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:51.920]   And all of ours will be there.
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:53.200]   Oh, was that it?
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:53.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.320]   Yeah, search for Twig.
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:55.520]   You'll find everything.
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.960]   Then you press the subscribe button.
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:01.200]   But here's the feature I really like under the three dots, add to home screen.
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:08.320]   And now you can have album art of your favorite podcast right there on the home screen.
[02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:13.920]   So if you want to listen to your show, there's actually an icon for it and you can listen to it.
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:14.720]   They will.
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:17.840]   Some of the controls are a primitive compared to what's out there.
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:22.720]   Google says they're going to improve this over time.
[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:26.480]   And I think anything that makes it easier to listen to podcasts is great in my book.
[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:29.920]   And it's free if you're on Android, Google podcasts now out.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:34.480]   And that is a nice feature, the ability to put the album art right on the Android home screen.
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:36.240]   So you just tap it.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:36.720]   Boom.
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:38.160]   And it comes up.
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:38.800]   Place.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:39.040]   Yeah.
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:43.040]   And it syncs to the Google Home.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:44.480]   We actually talked about this on our show.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:46.560]   Thank you for reminding me.
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:51.600]   So if I get halfway through Stacey and IOT and then I get home,
[02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:53.680]   I can just tell the Google Home, play the rest of it.
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:55.200]   And it'll start where I left off.
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:59.920]   But it's only a one way sync from the phone to the home.
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:02.320]   Oh, it doesn't remember what you listen to on the home?
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:02.960]   It doesn't go.
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:03.920]   It's only one way.
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:04.960]   That's a downside so far.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:05.760]   That's dopey.
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.200]   Yes.
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:12.000]   We can go from phone to home, but it can't double.
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.120]   The only I wish it had.
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:14.080]   Yes.
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.360]   It was a tech category.
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:16.320]   Yeah.
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:16.880]   Isn't that weird?
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:17.760]   I went through all of them.
[02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:19.200]   It's got everything but not tech.
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.800]   We don't show up in any other categories.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.320]   We'd probably show up in tech, but we don't.
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:24.640]   Who the heck do you think invented freaking a podcast?
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:24.960]   I know.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:27.840]   It used to be the only podcast we're about to tech.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:29.840]   And now like the only blogs back in the day.
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:30.880]   No, it's everything else.
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:32.880]   But that's all right.
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:35.520]   How's that first first mover advantage feel fell off?
[02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:35.920]   Yeah.
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.040]   No, nothing.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:38.000]   Zipity doo-dah.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000]   I don't.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.840]   I've had it's been a fun ride.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:43.600]   You've been replaced by sculm.
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:45.040]   Sculm.
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:46.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:48.240]   No, I don't think I'll ever do anything like that.
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.080]   I'm just going to ride this off into the sunset.
[02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:50.880]   You know, that's okay.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:51.280]   That's good.
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:52.000]   That's what happens.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.560]   Jeff, let me tell you kids.
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:58.320]   You're supposed to be replaced by kids.
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:21:58.800]   That's good.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:00.240]   Well, yeah.
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:02.960]   It beats being replaced by puppies or something.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:04.240]   Or being replaced by weasels.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:06.320]   Leonard Taure Professor for journalistic innovation
[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:08.400]   at the Craig Neumark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:09.680]   at the City University of New York.
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:10.720]   That's him right there.
[02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:12.800]   Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com.
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:15.280]   At Jeff Jarvis, he's also Director of the Townite Center
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:18.000]   for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Neumark Graduate
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000]   School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:20.880]   You don't need to do this.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:23.600]   I got it all.
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:24.240]   I got propped her.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.040]   I got it on prop.
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:25.680]   You did well.
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.000]   You did well.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:26.320]   Yeah.
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:30.480]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:31.040]   Always a pleasure.
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:31.920]   We're going to go up to here.
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:32.800]   Oh my god.
[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:35.280]   We'll figure out a way to get a scrolling lower third in one day.
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.800]   Just like we're going to figure out how to give Stacy Higaboth
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:40.080]   him a giant boxing glove.
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:42.640]   She can pop at me whenever she's mad.
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.080]   She didn't get mad at me today.
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.200]   I must have been okay.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:48.000]   No, although I did notice everything we tweet all of her.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.080]   So I'm doing this in all of them.
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:50.640]   And everyone.
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:53.600]   It's like the tweeted, the show promo videos.
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:55.200]   I'm going to tell the marketing guy.
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.160]   I'm going to tell the marketing guy.
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:57.920]   No more Stacy head in her hands.
[02:22:57.920 --> 02:22:59.280]   She's happy.
[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:00.720]   She's clearly frustrated with this.
[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:02.080]   But a lot of times I am cheery.
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:04.080]   Almost all the time.
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:06.400]   Except when Leo says something stupid, which happened.
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:07.120]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:08.240]   I'm speaking of Twitter.
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:08.880]   Speaking of Twitter.
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:11.120]   So I went into Twitter and I happened to see a tweet the other day.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:13.440]   Just said, oh, you know, I'm so fed up.
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:17.040]   You just keep on using your shows to promote Brianna Wu's campaign.
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:18.640]   So I said back, thank you.
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:20.560]   I'll remember to mention her campaign on the show.
[02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:26.400]   I just gave her some money because the primaries are coming up in Massachusetts.
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:29.440]   Brianna is running for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:34.160]   against an incumbent who ran unopposed last time.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:35.920]   And one with what did she say?
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:40.320]   Like 20,000 votes out of the 150,000 voters in the district.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:41.440]   It's crazy.
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:44.480]   Brianna Wu 2018.com.
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:47.680]   No, in fact, I don't want it's not just Brianna.
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:51.520]   I mean, if anybody who is tech savvy, who is running for Congress.
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:55.680]   You know, you got my vote, particularly if you're a woman.
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.480]   Because we need more women in Congress.
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:03.120]   Bloomberg is pledging $80 million to support Democrats.
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:03.760]   I saw that.
[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:05.120]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:05.840]   When's he running?
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:08.080]   He's a Republican.
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:09.040]   That's the funny thing.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:09.600]   He's ancient.
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:10.480]   Yeah, he's too old.
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:12.560]   He'd be 76, I think, when he,
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:13.840]   if, no, no, no, no.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:14.560]   Sorry, sorry.
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:16.560]   He's really old.
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:19.520]   And but it's funny that he's supporting Democrats, isn't it?
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:22.720]   No, he was, he's a New York Republican.
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:22.960]   Right.
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:25.040]   I mean, so he's a rock and roll.
