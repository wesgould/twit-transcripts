[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Coming up, it's Twig with Matthew Ingram, Ant, Pruitt, and Jeff Jarvis and me.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Yeah, I'm back. We're going to talk about the Pixel 4.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Finally, get to talk about the Pixel 4, what we love or hate.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Speaking of love, hate that pendulum keeps swimming back and forth for tech.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   TikTok says, "China doesn't tell me what to do, and we'll find out what my clunky means."
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's time for twig this week in Google. A show that's about everything but Google.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Sometimes.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Today it'll be about Google.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Of course Jeff Jarvis is here but you are in a hotel room somewhere.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   In a hotel room somewhere in Florida with my new Yeti mic.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's a mini Yeti.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's a Nano. Yeti.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Nano.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Sounds great actually.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Blue Yeti Nano. Yeah, it's pretty nice.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We've had problems with headsets and it's not unusual when you throw them in a suitcase.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   They tend to get damaged and the mic sounds bad.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So I think this will do better. I hope it will.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah, I think it's much better.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Jeremy had me that came with a holder which weighed twice as much as the mic.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Get rid of it.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So I have a little tiny tripod.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Just just had a little hanger.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   The mic goes into the mic itself.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I know. Isn't that nice?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Nice logo.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hey, that's Abruit.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Right next to me.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yes.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Star of Stage Screen and Hands on Photography and Focus on Photography are two great photographers
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   that are doing really, really well. Thank you, Ant.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I really love them.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's good to have you back even though I did slam my knee on the table since you're shorter.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Me.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm trying to crush his massive thighs to no avail.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Even the motor in this thing.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Hand down.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And thanks for filling in while I was gone.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Also here, Matthew Ingram Stacey is out today, but Matthew is here, Chief Digital Writer
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.400]   at the Columbia Journalism Review, C-G-A-C-J-R.org.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.000]   And Matthew is in Snowbound, Ottawa.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I don't think they've been in this room before.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Have we, Matthew?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   This is new.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So we moved.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Oh, you moved.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Oh, did you leave the Nazi books behind?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I did.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That was my job.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I was like, "Yeah, it's something like this."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   See, no Nazi books.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   No, he had the third Reich or something behind him over his shoulder.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I said, "Maybe you ought to move that."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I mean, it's important, but maybe I'll move that just.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So I got the Pixel 4 while I was gone, unfortunately.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I didn't get to bring it on the trip, which I've liked.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Ant and I both are orange, or the orange twins.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I am kind of amazed at the negativity.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.400]   We're on a Mario who I love, right, and for ours, Technica, slammed it back and forth,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   left and right.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.000]   Basically, the conclusion, even Florence Aion, said, "It's not worth it.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.600]   Don't upgrade."
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.760]   People are, I think, miffed because Google didn't do enough in this new one to make it
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.800]   different enough in the Pixel 3.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.000]   I don't think they did.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   It's a nice phone, but it still doesn't justify the price.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.800]   I'm going to show you two reasons.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.400]   First of all, let me just do this again.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   Don't you think the face recognition is...
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.500]   Ron said it's slow.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.800]   It's not slow.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.700]   It's not slow.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   It's fantastic.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   I'm worth pretty good.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.700]   I have Nick.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   Lattuck forever.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.000]   No, it was the lights or something.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Well, it puts your finger on the back and it's boom.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's done.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So much better.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   No, no, no.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It's almost instant.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's almost instant.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.400]   In fact, I took it out of my front pocket a second ago and it was already unlocked and
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   then the minute it cut sighted me.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So I like that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Do it again.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Well, this is not a good...
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.440]   It's got a light shining right in it and my face is at an angle to it.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.000]   So I don't know if this is a good...
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.200]   Mine is working and it's not even in front of me.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   It's just...
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   See, I have to do...
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   But see, if I do that...
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.600]   So let me do it again with this.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   Oh, well, that's all just have to go...
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   No, you have to face it.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   I'll do it all around.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   Look how fast that was.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   It's pretty quick.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.400]   I'm facing it.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   You don't want it to unlock if you're not facing it.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.600]   Then it would just unlock willy-nilly.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.880]   Every now and then it struggles with my sunglasses, but for the most part, it's really quick.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.080]   I mean, this is the same thing and I have to say part of the reason it doesn't bother
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.360]   me is the same thing we went through with iPhones a couple of years back where they took
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.320]   the fingerprint out and you just get used to it.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.960]   But this to me is the killer.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   I mean, absolute killer feature of this.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.600]   First of all, and Google showed this at I/O, but the idea that I can make a recording and
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.240]   while I'm making the recording, it will live transcribe it and quite well, even down to
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.480]   punctuation, I don't even have to say exclamation mark period, new paragraph.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.240]   Although it did what I said.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   Well, you know, that's one of the things that's interesting about this.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.880]   It will go back and amend.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.800]   It does everything after the fact.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   It seems to understand context.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.400]   Yeah, you use this as you're going out to do reporting.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   You got to...
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.840]   Yeah, that is a killer.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.840]   Pretty high quality.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.080]   And is it how dependent upon that hardware, is it?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.640]   I think it is because it's the new Google Assistant on device.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.040]   So one of the reasons it's so fast is it's doing this super accurate transcription.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   And I have to say, super accurate transcription, nobody comes close and it's doing it on device.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.680]   So that's one thing I really like.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.400]   I'm going to save that out.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.480]   And then this to me, and I had to put it in the control panel, the widgets up here, because
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.960]   it was on by default.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.080]   It's called live caption.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.440]   Now the idea is if you're ever watching video or listening to audio, it will automatically
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   transcribe it.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.880]   I'm going to play a little bit of my tech guy show.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.320]   So I'm listening to a podcast and it's live captioning it as I'm listening.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.520]   It's pretty dag-um fast.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.480]   Well, I could have used that cheating trying to watch the impeachment hearings when I
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   was...
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.720]   Let's watch the impeachment hearings.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.040]   Great idea.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   Let's watch.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.920]   So we'll go to MSNBC.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.240]   Now you got it already in Melbourne, but that's okay.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.560]   Oh, and Nicole Wallace.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.160]   And so now the delay here is it's opening the stream to MSNBC.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.520]   It's buffering.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.520]   So same thing.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.680]   And you can move this, by the way.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   That is...
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   Now it's pretty...
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   That's impressive.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   Yeah, now how much would you pay?
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   So...
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.960]   And it works with YouTube too.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.640]   So if you're watching a YouTube video, it's going to transcribe that as you're watching
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.280]   it.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   So I have to...
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   And it's very accurate.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.080]   I've had to use the captions on YouTube for...
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.120]   Would you have killed for this in your come reporting days?
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.920]   I mean, this is worth the price of admission.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.520]   Plus I could turn the sound down and I could continue to watch the hearings while we do
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   the show.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   Yep.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.240]   Not if you used to ever know YouTube's transcripts.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.720]   It's a thousand times better than that.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   It's better too.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.280]   You know, sometimes on TV they'll have closed captions, but they're often done by computers
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   and they're awful.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   Usually...
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   All right.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.560]   This is actually kind of stunning.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   Can you save the file?
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.960]   Of this, I don't know.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   That's a good question.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.280]   You can of course when you record.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.440]   I don't see much of any options with it.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.880]   It is more of a turn it on or turn it off.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.080]   But I do recommend adding that live caption button to your controls there at the time.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.560]   Well, we want to save the file sometimes.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.600]   I think it actually shows up under your volume menu as well.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   It shows up under your volume.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   If I do volume, I can also do it there.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   So you don't need to add it to the controls.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   That's nice.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   Interesting.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   It was on by default.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.080]   I first couldn't figure out what was going on.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   What is going on?
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.120]   I'm watching a video and I'm getting captioning.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.800]   And you can move it anywhere on the screen.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.720]   So Google mentioned this at I/O.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.240]   I feel like all the negative reviews I've read are, well, it's just kind of more of the
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   same.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.480]   I think it's pretty good.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.280]   It's a nice just to be on the resident on there and everything else that can come with that.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   That's right.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   That's right.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.640]   The camera, what do you think, Gantt?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.840]   You're the photography guy.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.040]   The camera is really good.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.840]   Is it better than the three?
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   That's the question.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.360]   I think it's just a touch better.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   It's not much better.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.400]   I have a friend that's using the three and we put some side by side comparisons up.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.920]   And his name is Obie.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   I'm not going to say his last name.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.480]   His name is Obie.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.120]   And we all know it's one.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.040]   Obie, you don't have to hide it.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   It's okay.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.000]   You know some famous people.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.360]   And when we put him side by side, you can see a little more detail in the four versus
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   the three.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   Not to say that the three is bad, but there's still just a little more detail.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   What about the zoom?
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.560]   Because remember that was one of the things in the announcement.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   Stop at 5X.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   Don't go any further.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   Don't go any further than 5X.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.920]   2X is really good though.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   Really good.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.960]   So one of the things Ron complained about and a lot of complain about and I don't blame
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.880]   them is that every other phone now has three lenses including a super wide.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.360]   This didn't do that.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   I guess that's a preference though.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   I don't particularly care for those super wise don't look great.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   Right.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.480]   Because a lot of times you're going to get soft edges in your images and distortion.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   I just don't care for that.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.440]   Give me a telephoto any day.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.960]   So I mean, the 90 Hertz everybody said, "Oh, come on Google because you have to turn the
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.320]   brightness up to a certain point."
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.640]   I mean, I think everybody knows this, but I'll show you anyway.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.560]   If you turn on developer options, which you do by tapping the build number seven times,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.480]   once developer options are on, you can say, "I want 90 Hertz all the time."
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   I don't know.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   Do you notice a difference with 90 Hertz?
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   I did not.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.280]   I've turned it off actually.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.880]   It's going to kill battery a little bit faster, but they say people say it's buttery smooth
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   animation.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   It's buttery.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   I didn't see a difference.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   It's the buttery.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   It's the buttery.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.600]   Running the 60 and it feels just fine.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.280]   And my battery is lasting pretty much most of the day.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.040]   So you're not against it, you're just saying, "I think it's overkill.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.680]   It's not really doing anything for the user experience for me anyway."
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:43.320]   It's really for people who look at numbers and say, "I want the phone that has the bigger
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   number."
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.320]   What phone did you have before?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   I forget.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   The Pixel 2?
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.320]   Oh, you jumped.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   You skipped.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   I jumped.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   Well, you're going to be even happy.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.040]   I mean, anybody who had a Pixel 2 probably should get a 4, right?
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.120]   That would be the only way I would upgrade.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.040]   I wouldn't necessarily go from 3 to the 4.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.040]   Yeah, it's not a huge.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.680]   I'm not going to have to get my 3A.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680]   But that transcription, see.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680]   I mean, if you...
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.680]   That's pretty damn...
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   That's close to becoming to the 3A.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   Are you going to have the 3A?
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   Will it?
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   One of these days.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   One of these days.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   They're going to have an APK out there for it.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.080]   Well, they said by the end of the year that the captions and the transcription will come
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080]   to the...
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   We'll see.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   We'll come to the 3.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   It's the new assistant.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.440]   So the issue is how much...
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.600]   It's all on phone.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.440]   So the question is how much hardware do you need to do that?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.400]   And is there specialized hardware to do that?
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   Right.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   So as we've seen with some of the camera features, you can put it on the 3A, but it's not going
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.800]   to be quite as good as a phone with the additional hardware, that kind of thing.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.120]   Now, speaking of the camera, we talked about the night site.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   Astrophotography feature just built in.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.280]   Have you played with it?
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   It's AI.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.320]   And a lot of people tend to forget that.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   It's AI.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.000]   I've played around with it.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.320]   And I've also installed a manual camera app to where I could actually set up like a 10-second
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   exposure.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   And I compared the two.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   And the AI does a pretty good job, but there's nothing like setting up your ISO.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.840]   But this is a phone.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   Yes.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.480]   Although you make an interesting point, if you're going to do Astrophotography...
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   Do it right.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.560]   You're going to want to do it with a phone?
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   Well, no, it's...
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   Well, I'll have to show you.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.560]   I guess I could put it into the...
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   I believe it.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   No, that's all right.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   We get the idea.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.760]   And there's a lot of examples.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.240]   In fact, even in the Twit community, a number of people posted there, you know, just quick
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   and dirty.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.000]   I took a picture of the sky.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Right.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.760]   I mean, it's kind of neat that you can do that.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.240]   I think it's capability.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.480]   It's a proof of concept, if you have anything.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.440]   And I could spend a little more time with it.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.080]   Hopefully I'll be able to spend a little more time over the holidays while we're not
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   in the studio.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.640]   I want a hands-on photo all about using the Pixel 4.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   That's what I want.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   Okay.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   Asking you showers.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   All right.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.640]   Order is from the boss.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.640]   Well, not really.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.280]   You know, when the president says he'd like something, does that mean it's an order?
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   It's an order.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   It's a suggestion.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   Again, Valentine folks.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.080]   So Leo, did you order a Pixelbook Go?
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080]   Absolutely not.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   Pricey.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   Why?
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   Pricing again.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.280]   It's overpriced underpowered and it's you like the grippy bottom.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.680]   It's not really grippy.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   It's just wavy.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.280]   I think you like saying that.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.880]   I like a grippy bottom.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   I cannot lie.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.880]   There's other brothers, Candin.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.080]   I when a Pixelbook comes in.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.240]   The itty bitty.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   I don't know what.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.280]   Anyway, I think we're going to have to stop right there.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   Yeah, please do not.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   I'm like Gary Belbert.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.280]   Please do.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   All right.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:46.000]   So in other words, I just what do you why do you think the negativity from everybody
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.320]   all in sundry on the Pixel 4?
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320]   I don't know.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.640]   Again, I think a lot of people were really down on the battery life for good reason,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.320]   but I think there was because they were testing the Pixel 4 and that they said they were
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   pre judging.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   They still.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.480]   They saw the size of the battery, which is smaller than the Pixel 3 XL.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.960]   And they said, oh, that can't work.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   All right.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.680]   But I got to point out the iPhone 11 has a smaller battery.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   It's not a big battery.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   Oh, it's not.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.080]   It's not a huge battery, but there's a lot you can do with software and chip tuning and
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.000]   I feel like there's some phone fatigue out there.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   That's really it.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Like I really people have.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Well, there is that.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You know, they want they want every new one to be orders of magnitude better.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.440]   It's not enough that it's just better or a little better has to be like change the
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   world better.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   But is that fair?
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.600]   Well, it's the way you show off these days is to criticize tech companies.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.760]   There was a thread on the Twitter community.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.440]   And I've seen it in Reddit and other places saying, I don't want to read tech reviews
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   anymore because I'm all excited about my new XYZ and they're just dumping on it.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   Dumping on it.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.960]   And I'm extremely the other from utopia to dystopia from fanboy to smash it.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.400]   And that's the way people show off now.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.000]   And it's turned into kind of almost a tech nihilism.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.040]   Is it that those negative reviews get more clicks, more views?
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   You bet.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.800]   You know, but I also think it's in the it's in our psyche because we have these same conversations
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:21.040]   about big tech and of course Jeff's defense big tech and others sometimes me say, oh,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   and you know, oh, can you get me my grumpy cat cover?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.640]   A Sunday time.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.040]   Did you see that this week?
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.280]   The New York Times Sunday magazine.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   I'm amazing.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.680]   The whole magazine that was devoted to how how crappy the internet is.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.800]   That's Kevin Roos's article online cesspool got you down.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.000]   Just bugs the F out of there.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.160]   I feel bad for those cats.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.840]   Well, they're clearly unhappy.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.960]   I don't think they're actually covered with whatever that brown stuff.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.200]   They are definitely covered without any cat is likely about that.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.600]   No, so this is the cover of the magazine, which has grumpy cat looking for who's passed
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   away.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.560]   So it's a similar to our sauce.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.600]   Simulated grumpy cat.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.040]   So the internet did this is the tagline.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.520]   The internet didn't turn out the way we hoped.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   So this.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   What was that?
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:24.440]   But then we hope we thought it was going to convert everybody to a good form of Catholicism.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.880]   And instead we got a darned Reformation and a 30 years war.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.680]   Somehow you got Gutenberg in there without even mentioning.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   Of course.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.680]   That's very impressive.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   Very, very impressive.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   No, I can't hear you.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.880]   No, but I think that's it.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.440]   I don't think it's unfair though that I don't think I mean, I've talked about that with
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.680]   people about how when I first discovered the internet and blogs and Twitter, it all seemed
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   so fantastic.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:57.040]   And it was all going to be this wonderful sort of democratizing force, which it has
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   been.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.120]   But we've seen all the downsides of it in the last little while.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   So it's a down sign.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   It's a down sign though, isn't it Matthew?
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.720]   That's what I'm not saying.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   That's what comes to mind.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   That's what comes to mind.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.320]   Is who's faulting that?
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.760]   Is that the fault is in our stars or is it on the internet?
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.920]   Well, it's a bit of both to me.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   It's a bit of both to me.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.680]   So you can't like obviously people, you know, Facebook did not invent people trolling or
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.840]   believing things that are wrong or conspiracy theories.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:36.960]   The good Facebook, the Facebook does use the algorithm to make those things travel faster
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.480]   and farther and more people see them.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.160]   That's the good and bad about it.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.320]   We have this, everybody has a voice now, you know, regardless of who you are, regardless
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.920]   of your stature, everybody has a voice.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.240]   And see, we all that would be a great thing.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   Right.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240]   But it is.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.920]   But at the same time, the trolling crap that I see on a daily basis.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   Everybody has a voice.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.920]   Even jerks.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   Right.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.440]   And I'm like, man, I wish I could just check this person up.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   Right.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.440]   So we can't forget.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.320]   Sorry, Matthew, I didn't hear you there.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.720]   I was just saying that some of those voices get amplified and those are choices that Facebook
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.560]   and Twitter make.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.080]   But I think that that's that software is still dumb, right?
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.720]   So retargeting advertising, right?
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.120]   You looked at those boots once on Amazon, you bought the boots and they still follow
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.400]   when you were around six weeks later.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   That's just dumb software.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.800]   It doesn't mean it is dastardly software.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   It's dumb software.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   Right.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.080]   And I think you can blame us a little bit in our expectations.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.000]   We were naive.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.840]   We were sure we thought, oh, everybody gets a voice.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.320]   And we didn't think of the, you know, everybody gets a voice.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   So it's.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.720]   So as you said, instead of getting the great Catholic, you know, explosion, we got the
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:06.360]   Reformation, but also just a book yesterday called Black Software, which looks really
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   good.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.040]   It's by, I think, a provost at New York University.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.240]   And I just got through the first five or ten pages.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.400]   So I don't really know it yet.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.200]   But what he's arguing is that all the, well, as far as I can tell, the talk about Black
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.040]   Lives Matter and such, he said, no, this goes back 30, 40 years where African Americans
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.000]   were left out of this technology.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.880]   And there was a core of kind of renegade people who used it.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.440]   I think we can't overlook.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.880]   Yes, so far right wing, bozos and Russians misused this stuff.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   Yes.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.200]   But there's other people who were always left out who now have an opportunity and have
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.680]   tools to gather an act.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.960]   And I think that gets left out all the time, especially by mainstream media like New York
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   Times.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.800]   And it's definitely like the pendulum has definitely swung, you know, first it was way
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.440]   over on the, this is the best thing ever.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.440]   And it's going to, you know, it's going to usher in like democracy around the world and
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.040]   make people's lives better.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:11.400]   And now it's, you know, we're, everyone is focusing on the negative for a pile of reasons.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   I mean, Trump being Trump being one of them.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.440]   But obviously the Trump has nothing that man can't even type.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   He is nothing.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.240]   No, but he can type perfectly well.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.440]   Look at his Twitter feed.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.440]   He's like a co-feed.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.880]   Everything that's gone wrong.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.680]   But there's the unit supporters.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   You know, but there's lots of symbols.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.840]   There's, there's Russia.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.200]   There's lots of symbols of everything that's gone wrong.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.360]   I think it was foolish of us to think that it would all be some utopian wonder land.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   Right.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.760]   But in, in, I, and this is what I guess what I want to say for myself anyway, I do think
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.160]   I've been a little bit, the pendulum had did swing for me.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.960]   And I went from being a utopian to a dystopian and all glumabat.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.040]   And I think I want to kind of get back into the middle where thank you, Jeff.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   Welcome back.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:05.000]   Well, there are clear benefits and there are clear documents and that's why.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.600]   I think a good way of swinging back to the good side of it is, is one of the things that
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.360]   you've already implemented and that's the community is finding, finding your hope, you
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   know, that's really interesting.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.240]   You find in your tribe, if you will, if you're going to have, if you're going to use social
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.640]   media, have your followers or what have you, but trim down that stack of followers that
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.680]   you have and you'll see the difference just in your mood, automatic.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.040]   Yeah, we designed it too.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   Right.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   So Jimmy Wales has started a new social network.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   I went and signed it out.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   I like it.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   I can't see your notes.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   There's nothing there.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.120]   That's why you can't figure it out.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:49.480]   It's, it's like multiple chat rooms about completely, you know, mostly about cryptocurrency
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   as far as I can tell.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.680]   Here's the funny, here's the funny headline in the BBC.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.880]   Thousands flocked to Wikipedia, Facebook forever.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.880]   Okay.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.480]   If, if that success, you got a problem.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   Thousands.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.680]   I mean, thousands.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:10.360]   I said, like, like calling it a Facebook rival is like me, my neighbor has a garage sale.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.880]   And I say my neighbor is now an Amazon rival.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   Right.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.640]   Well, technically that's true, right?
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.760]   But there's no way in a million years, like I want to see where it goes.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   And I think it's interesting.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.520]   But to cast it as a Facebook rival is ridiculous.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.280]   Did Wales call it a Facebook rival or did the headline writers?
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   No, no.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.760]   So we can't blame Jimmy Wales.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.600]   Actually an extension of Wickey Tribune of his, of his effort at New, where he was
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.720]   to try to empower people to do news.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.040]   But yeah, I love Jimmy, and I just haven't been able to get, dug into it yet because
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   I only have two friends.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.000]   I'm not going to bother myself.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.400]   There's not much there.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.240]   So will it become something maybe?
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.440]   But at the moment, it's, there's a lot of.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.040]   What were the other efforts to unseat?
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   Oh, God.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   Diaspora.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   Remember that?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   Mastodon.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   And hello.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   Mastodon's more against Twitter.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.360]   We've been nested on still around.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   People use it.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   I use it.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   People still use it.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   I ask personal around.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   And I think so.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.040]   So, this is how it works.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.440]   If you give them money, $100 a year, $12.99 a month, you can jump the list.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.240]   I'm currently $73,940 on the waiting list to get in.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   Oh, really?
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.560]   But when I first signed up, and when you first sign up, you will get in and get to pick a
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.640]   bunch of topics.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   And I'm not kidding.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.840]   90% of them were cryptocurrency related.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.920]   It's kind of turned me off.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.360]   That's actually when I said, I'm not going to give you a hundred bucks to jump the line
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.880]   and get in here.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.120]   So that might be part of the problem.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   Oh, God.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.280]   We've seen this over and over again.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.480]   One of the reasons that I'm...
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.440]   To John Mack, if you have anything to do with that?
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.200]   One of the reasons I agree with you, the local communities might be the solution.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.280]   And one of the things about Mastodon that makes it interesting is it's federated local
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   communities.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.280]   Swell.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280]   Swell.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.600]   Is that a local community that has this natural affinity and I think also avoids because people
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.560]   almost feel like they know each other avoids some of the worst excesses of Twitter and
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.560]   Facebook.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   Right.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:23.480]   So, the community, I think is in a way a template for the future of social online, which is
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   I think so.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   I think smaller...
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   Has this really been the conversation has been fascinating.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:34.760]   Smaller, localer, or maybe more aligned around certain interests, things.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:40.360]   But then is there still a role for a big global thing like Facebook and Twitter?
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   It's...
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.640]   So you're not really scared of going towards...
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.440]   If you still want to keep in touch with anti-sow and so-or-cuz and so-and-so-or-ubbin, that's
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.680]   where Facebook is gonna...
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.420]   But that power effect also brings...
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.360]   Even a lot of Facebook is going towards private groups.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   Right.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   A lot more people using private groups.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   That's good.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:06.720]   And I mean, even Zuckerberg said the future is encrypted, ephemeral, WhatsApp groups.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.760]   Lots of people are moving into those.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.980]   People are using next door and stuff like that as sort of community.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.980]   Right.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.320]   So I think that's sort of broad mass sort of that we're gonna start ready going away.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.760]   We're seeing another transformation.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.200]   And that's what you're gonna see is continuous transformation.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.240]   I'll tell you the thing.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.480]   Both bugs me and amazes me is the...
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.140]   And you knew this already because you're in Canada, Matt and Matthew and because Jeff
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.640]   you travel all the time is the predominance of WhatsApp.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   Everywhere.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   Everywhere.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.640]   It is the default.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   Everywhere.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.220]   Everywhere. For communication, for community, for group.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.740]   Everywhere I went.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:50.660]   And now listening to the impeachment testimony, apparently it's also how government gets done.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:56.860]   I found that kind of both disturbing and amazing that all of this back channel stuff with
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:04.380]   Sunland and others was going on on unprotected cell phones and WhatsApp.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.020]   So and those of us who are in the tech community know how insecure it is and how problematic
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.020]   it is.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.460]   It's owned by Facebook.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.420]   But the rest of the world, everybody, it's just...
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.660]   But it got to get worse.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.660]   I put this in...
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.660]   In also...
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.660]   In the online.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.300]   I was at my final meeting in my transatlantic high level working group on content moderation
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.380]   and freedom of expression in Milan last week in Bellagio.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.380]   Oh, nice.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.460]   And one of the people there were the really bright people former Obama White House kept
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.760]   bringing up TikTok and kept saying we have all these nice little rules we're trying to
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.840]   make for Twitter and Facebook.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:47.680]   And it's meaningless when you get a company like TikTok there that's going to have wholesale
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.920]   erasure of content about, even though apparently they're letting in Hong Kong stay in the
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.920]   US these for a while.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.120]   But what do you do with companies for other countries where you're not going to have the
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.120]   control that we think we're going to have over them in our regulated world?
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.360]   TikTok is owned, of course, by a Chinese company.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.400]   The CEO of TikTok this week said, "Oh, no, they don't tell us."
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.920]   They don't tell us what...
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   The fact that there is no Hong Kong content...
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.280]   He don't want to say that they don't tell me anything.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.680]   He said with a straight face that if the Chinese government asked him for information, he would
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   say no.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   Oh, no.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   And I would love to see that happen.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.960]   He's not Chinese though.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.640]   No.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.400]   So I guess he's been along with the purchase.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.480]   But yeah, it's owned by a Chinese company.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.800]   A Chinese company is always going to do...
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.280]   Like American company, he's always going to do with the Chinese government.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280]   Whatever the government says.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.280]   You have to.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   Call your bluff.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.280]   You don't have a choice.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.280]   Do you guys have...
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   You guys use TikTok?
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   Negative.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.280]   I use it all the time.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.280]   It's just vine.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   It's vine basically.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   Have you ever used vine?
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   You've used TikTok.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Nope.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.280]   I have no desire.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   No desire.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   I'm surprised because you're the creator.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   I think you could do...
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.280]   So I don't use the library.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.760]   You have that and you have Snapchat.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.120]   And when I look at the audiences for both of those platforms, I just don't see that
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.320]   my audiences on any of those platforms.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.120]   But Jeff, and you've talked about this before, vine has created stars.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120]   It has.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   And it was on a...
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   TikTok too.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   Well, that was a weird thing.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.320]   Is the Twitter bought it and killed it, which is insane because you have this...
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   Classic.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   Classic.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   Classic.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   Oh, God.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   That's so stupid.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   So, along comes...
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   Well, they killed it.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   It was originally musically.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.360]   And they just said, "Well, we'll do the same thing."
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   And the same thing happened.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.360]   You've got stars.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.000]   You've got huge followers.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Yep.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.640]   There's people that are doing some good stuff on there.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   I just...
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   Not free.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.760]   Like I said, I don't think my audience is over there.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.880]   Is there a security issue for TikTok on your phone?
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   Only that the Chinese government says that.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   I'm gonna say it to few.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.040]   It depends on how deep you want to do it.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   What does it mean security?
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   What does that mean?
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   I mean, I know the Huawei phone.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   So, it pretty much is...
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.080]   You do really use a Huawei.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.280]   Yeah, the P20.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.680]   Actually, that's what's really sad about all this camera conversation.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.000]   It turns out probably the Huawei's, especially the new P30 are, the better cameras, best
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.400]   camera of anybody.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   Amazing.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   Including the zoom on the Huawei's.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   But what about the...
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.400]   I know you're eight megapixel.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.440]   I'm about to keep back up and shins it.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.840]   What about the 108 megapixel Xiaomi phone?
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   There you go.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   No, don't worry.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   No, it's not.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.320]   No, don't do that.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   I know that.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.800]   But that's what would sell is because of that big number of similar...
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.480]   It's got a whole specs with the Pixel 4 versus the other...
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   Refresh rate.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.320]   Just like stereo watts per side back at the old...
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   Remember that?
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.720]   That's you and I all remember that.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.480]   That's 1,500 watts per side.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.000]   I don't care what I'm playing on it, but listen.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.720]   Listen, how loud I can turn it.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.640]   We did this the other day with the new MacBook Pro.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.560]   We always played the 1812 Overture.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   The Canon's.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.560]   Yes.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.560]   Just to see.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   Yes.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.560]   Out of the Canon's sound.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.560]   Like...
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   But that's funny.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.080]   That's 60's changed that.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.200]   That's when the Rolling Stones started writing about the content you were playing instead
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.520]   of the RMS, the number of watts per channel, the distortion and all that stuff.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.920]   And we went from that speeds and feeds to the content.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.640]   That happened on the internet a decade ago or so.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   All right.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   Let me take a break.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   We could talk more.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   It turned on TikTok.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.200]   That's a woman who was doing nothing but throwing slices of processed cheese to have
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   them stick to things.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   The car.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   Brilliant.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Oh, man.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   I want to watch that over and over.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   That's a comedy.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.200]   That's where my audience is.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.840]   That's the whole truth.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.160]   We sound like old farts.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.000]   There's great...
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.240]   So there's at least on Vine, this happened.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.640]   There were comedians who became famous on Vine.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.080]   I'm a bitch.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   I think there's some of that similar stuff.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.120]   It looks easier to make than snapchat stuff.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   I can't.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.120]   You know?
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   No.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   I don't know.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.600]   Until Milton Burl starts using it, I don't think it's a recipe.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.520]   When I go, "Milties on TikTok," that's when you get me.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.680]   Okay now you really sound old.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   I made an account and I posted a video and I just see it and I don't know.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   Here's the real housewives of TikTok.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   Yep.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.920]   My audience.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.680]   Yeah, it's the My machine.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.720]   Imagine Trump on TikTok.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   Why isn't he on TikTok?
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   He's...
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   He's people got to get him on there.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720]   It will be.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   What's that?
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   Brad Parscal's got it.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:49.400]   Brad, see that's the problem with having a social media maven.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.640]   Their best buy date is very quick.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.880]   A year from now, everything you know is wrong.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   Right.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   It's not.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   What?
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   It's Twitter.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   Brad's like 40.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   Yeah, Brad's an old man now.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   You know how to buy Facebook ads, but do you know about TikTok, Brad?
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   Come on.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.680]   Yeah, with a program.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.200]   Our show today, I actually think this is one of the few...
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   One of the few things that really is great on the internet and I use it like crazy.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.120]   It's privacy.com.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.400]   You tell you all the time, don't use the same password everywhere, but you'd use the
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.880]   same credit card everywhere.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.640]   Well, that's nuts.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.780]   With privacy.com, you get a brand new virtual Visa or MasterCard number for every purchase
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.440]   you make online with one click.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.840]   I have it as a plug-in in my browser, which makes it very easy, but even better than that,
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.080]   you can lock it down.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.800]   So as soon as it's used by a merchant, only that merchant can use it.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.400]   Nobody can steal it and use it.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.120]   You can set a limit, which I love.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.000]   I know exactly how big my charges are.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.600]   So I have one for Amazon for everyone.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:57.120]   In fact, when I do business with somebody new, that's the right way I sign up for...
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:03.160]   I just did a subscription with a vitamin store and I never bought anything from them before.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   So of course...
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   Right.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.920]   And here's the other reason you want to use privacy.com.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.680]   You can pause it.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:14.520]   So when I sign up for subscriptions, I always use privacy.com because sometimes it's hard
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.720]   to cancel these subscriptions.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.880]   The easiest way to cancel a subscription, you pause the card.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.280]   Then you get that great email.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.760]   Hey, your card doesn't work anymore.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.920]   Give us a new one and you're going to never mind.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   Goodbye.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   Privacy.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.360]   It is awesome.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.560]   And refunds work even if you pause or close the card, by the way.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.360]   You could freeze and unfreeze cards on and off at will.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.240]   You put the Chrome Web Store has a browser extension so you can do a Chrome, which means
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.360]   also you can do it in the new Edge.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.360]   You can do it in Brave.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.160]   There's an Android and iOS app.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.160]   I love it.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.360]   You can link your virtual cards.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.320]   Now, I should mention this.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.040]   You either link it to your checking account or your debit card.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.440]   So it isn't a charge card.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.120]   It is immediately going to be debited from your account either through your debit card
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.200]   or your checking account.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.040]   I don't mind that.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.000]   That's not why I'm using it.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.880]   I'm using it because I really want security and this is awesome.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.280]   Spending limits per charge, per month or per year.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.480]   And your virtual cards are locked to a merchant so you don't ever have to worry about your
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   card gets hacked.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   No big deal.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.520]   You freeze it or you destroy it and you don't have to change it anywhere else.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.200]   You'll get a decline email or push notification if somebody tries to use the card at another
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   location.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.400]   Then you know a hacker got my card.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   Right.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.600]   They're PCI DSS compliant.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.240]   That means they're real credit cards.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.840]   Same security standards as your bank.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.000]   I shouldn't call it a credit card.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.760]   It's more like a debit card, really.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.720]   Creative information is secured using strong encryption.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:50.320]   In fact, they go an extra step with split key encryption and partial keys are held by separate
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   employees.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.080]   So it really is private.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:59.440]   Now I use it all the time, but I don't think I ever do more than 12 a month.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.880]   And that's you get that for free.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.800]   That's the personal plan up to 12 cards a month.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.920]   But they notice they're people making hundreds of cards a month.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.720]   So they created new plans, pro and teams.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.320]   For $10 a month, you get the pro plan.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.440]   You get everything in the free plan plus automatically 1% cash back on all purchases,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.840]   up to 36 cards a month.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.760]   If you're making more than one a day, I don't know, more security, more privacy features,
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   that's $10 a month.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.480]   And if you have a team, in fact, this would be a great thing to do in a business.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.200]   $25 a month, you get all the pro stuff plus a dedicated account manager, 60 cards a month,
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   transaction limits tailored to your business lead needs.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.680]   So they're really expanding their offering since we started talking about privacy.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.920]   They've been a sponsor for some time.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.280]   I've been using them for even longer, literally for years.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   Privacy believes customers should have full control of their data.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.000]   So they give their customers access to transaction data via a webhook API.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   People watch the show probably know what that means.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.400]   It means it's easy to get that information.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.040]   Of course, I just have the privacy app and I get notifications.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.760]   I get all the information about every single card.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.560]   I always turn on two factor authentication.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   They support that.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.960]   My cards are super safe, super secure.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.720]   I use it for every subscription.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.440]   I use it anytime I'm on a merchant site.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   I don't know.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.920]   And I have one for every single site I use a lot to because why not protect your privacy,
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.080]   protect your money, virtual cards.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.800]   This company does it so well and they have the best name privacy.com.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.200]   To learn more, get a $5 credit off your first purchase, go to privacy.com/twig.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.640]   In fact, do that anyway because that way they'll know you saw it here and that helps
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   us.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.000]   privacy.com/twig.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And now they've got the pro and the team versions as well.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.080]   So the mic is lapping at me after I started here because I was in the host office making
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   a purchase online.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.520]   I pulled out my bunch of burner cards that I use for online purchases.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.520]   And he's like, dude, what are you doing?
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.520]   Privacy.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   It's all digital.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520]   Privacy.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   Do you use it now?
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   I do now.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   Isn't it awesome?
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   It's so much easier.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.520]   I'm going to have subscriptions.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.160]   I just go through the list of privacy.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160]   I should show you.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   I got the list of the positive, positive.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.920]   And then he told me about the subscription idea, especially for Netflix, Hulu or whatever.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.080]   He just said it out.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.080]   Pause it.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   It's so much easier.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.480]   I'm like, oh, thanks, man.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.280]   But he laughed at me.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.400]   Hey, speaking of, I see the chat room says, "New story just came in.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.120]   PayPal is buying honey."
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.520]   Oh, boy.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.080]   "For, get ready for this.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.640]   Honey, if you don't know, is a browser plug-in."
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.840]   Lisa uses it like crazy.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.160]   It's free.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.440]   When you go to a site, it'll say, "Get your--" it gets you those coupon codes automatically.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.520]   So you save money.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.880]   She saves a lot of money on it.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.480]   But, of course, what does honey get?
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.880]   They know everything you do.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   Oh, your data.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.680]   Everything you do.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.640]   PayPal has agreed to buy them for her.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.040]   This is how much your data is worth, aunt.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.080]   Four billion dollars.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.600]   It's the largest acquisition PayPal's ever made.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.600]   Wow.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.760]   Or billion dollars.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.200]   17 million monthly active users.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.720]   And, of course--
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   Congrats to honey.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.720]   Every active user.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   And I asked Lisa about it.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   She says, "I know.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   I don't care."
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   Because it's a plug-in.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   It's always-- it knows every site you go to.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   Right.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   It's watching.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.920]   That's where the value is.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   Congrats, honey.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   That's a nice payday.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   Wow.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.280]   Honey, I'm home.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   Nothing right along.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   Let's see here.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   Stadia.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.680]   See, I told you there was Google in this show.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   None of you are gamers.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   Are you a gamer?
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   Not anymore, no sir.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   Matthew, I don't think you're a gamer.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   I am.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.160]   Now you want to talk about people ragging on some technology?
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.240]   Yeah, but deservedly.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.080]   I-- OK, so Stadia has launched, but it's a slow launch.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.760]   I checked and I won't get mine till November 26.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   So I canceled that.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   Of course.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   I don't want it.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   How about you, Carsten?
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   Do you want it?
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.920]   I'm waiting.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   It's not a thing yet.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.920]   It's not--
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.440]   I spent $130 to get this magic first day controller and a Google Chrome Ultra, which
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   I already had anyway.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   You know what?
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.800]   They should have done.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   They should have done.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.520]   They should have gmailed it.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.280]   They should have had it be an invite-only service.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.440]   Oh, you're right.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   Make it a--
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   Make it like a--
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.280]   Make it-- because they're obviously slow launching it so they can build their servers
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   up.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.280]   Infrastructure.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.040]   Because this kind of thing takes a ton of infrastructure.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.920]   So you-- $130 one-time per-- just listen at home and see if this is something you would
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   do.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   $130 one-time perches.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.280]   You get a three-month trial for that after that.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   $10 a month.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.680]   Do you get the games for free?
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.160]   No, you get one game for free.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.760]   But the premium games you pay for just like you would in the store $60.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.760]   Nope.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.240]   Now, the difference is you don't really own the game.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.240]   It's on their servers.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.320]   You never get a copy of it.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   It's on their servers.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   Right.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.680]   And you lose that on a lot of game features like achievements or achievements.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.240]   So serious-- I don't think a serious gamer is going to do this.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.440]   Well, in their defense, if you're Xbox person or whatever, you can buy the game digitally.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.760]   Can you put it on your Xbox?
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   You can buy it digitally and this store it up there.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.600]   You don't get physical discs.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.960]   But can I put it on my Xbox or do I only play it on Stadia?
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.680]   No, you-- no, you can't play it.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:30.560]   I have maybe a 20 PlayStation 4 physical disc.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.880]   Yeah, but you already bought it.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.400]   And hundreds of-- but I own hundreds of PlayStation 4 games.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.800]   No, no, I don't care about the disc.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   No, it was just some other thing available.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.480]   I'm just saying, can I play it other than on Stadia?
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.800]   I mean, I bought a game, but I thought it was locked to Stadia.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   I don't know.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.440]   Yeah, that's not a word it, but I'm just not a really--
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.600]   Plus, you better have a gig a bit.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.640]   You're right, this is three mean on it.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.400]   The 4K is apparently not very good quality.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.160]   I want to play Red Dead Redemption 2.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.280]   That's one of the, I think, 15 games.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.800]   It's available $60.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.040]   But Mr. Howell did a really good job with his demo
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.520]   on Hands on Tech.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.560]   Yeah, watch that.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.920]   That hot episode's good.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.040]   The Verge spoke to Bungie, the developers of Destiny 2.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.520]   That's the free game.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.440]   And Bungie said, yes, Stadia's version is not the same 4K
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.280]   version as on other platforms.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.640]   It renders at 1080p and then is upscaled.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.560]   Yep.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.640]   That ain't 4K!
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.560]   Not at all.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.840]   Red Dead Redemption.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   Eurogamer confirmed the game only renders at 1440p
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.720]   and then is upscaled.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.600]   I just love that we live in a world where we can pitch and moan
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.920]   about, oh my god, it's not streaming 4K.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.520]   But the thing is, Karina--
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.480]   But I'm paying for 4K?
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.000]   You're going to pay for that.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.960]   And you have it there?
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.200]   I'm paying for the free tier.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.600]   The free tier is coming.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.680]   When's the free tier coming?
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.120]   Next year, free tier.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.000]   So here we go.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.680]   This is--
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.480]   This is Anthony's MacBook.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.040]   OK.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.920]   And what game are we playing, Anthony?
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.760]   Destiny 2, the free B. Here, I'm going to have to prop it up.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.400]   I can hold it up.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   Hold that way, yeah.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:18.880]   I got you.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.080]   Use those muscles for something.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.480]   Just like moving iron around.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.440]   It's still loading.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.320]   Loading.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.760]   Loading.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.360]   That's normal.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.480]   It loads that slow on Xbox too.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:34.920]   Oh, here we go.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.280]   That looks good there.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.240]   That looks like 4K.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.080]   Watch me get greased in minutes.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.320]   I'm sorry to do this to your account, Anthony.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   Ah!
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.960]   Oh, now I'm in the water.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.400]   That doesn't look bad.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   Actually, it looks pretty good.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.520]   That looks better than what Mr. Howell was showing.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.680]   OK, I'm scaling.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.720]   And now I should mention-- should I shoot this?
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   I don't know how to trigger it.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.400]   Oh, triggers.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:00.920]   I forgot.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.360]   This is Xbox.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.960]   I mean, PlayStation.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:12.560]   So this is-- this is-- what?
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.760]   I was I going to say I forgot?
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.320]   I'm busy.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.160]   Don't bother me.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.000]   Somebody's shooting at me.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.240]   See, now you like it.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.720]   But see, before Mr. Carson tried to give us a little bit
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.440]   of grief--
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:25.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.480]   Who is Google Marketing's Stadia 2 game?
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.840]   What's the target audience for Google Marketing Stadia?
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.120]   Is it the real gamer?
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.560]   Is it the casual gamer?
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.960]   Is it the people that play Candy Crush?
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.680]   Well, that's the weird thing.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.320]   This is no Candy Crush.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.000]   It's definitely not for the Candy Crush people.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.880]   And it's definitely not for the real gamers,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.520]   because they're going to shell out for our PC.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.880]   So now you take that middle tier and tell them
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.240]   they're going to have to pay X amount of dollars per month,
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.720]   plus pay another, say, $60 for a really good looking game.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.760]   Why would they do this and have this same lackluster
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.200]   performance when they could just go and get--
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.040]   Should I pick this up?
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.520]   --use PS4 or Xbox or what have you.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.640]   Google failed on that.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.880]   Start Adventure.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.000]   All right, I'm starting to have Adventure.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.120]   I kind of agree with you, actually, because--
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   I mean, technically--
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.040]   Actually, this looks great.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.480]   --I should be the one that--
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.160]   And I don't feel like there's much latency.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.720]   Did you feel Anthony there was a lot of latency?
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.520]   I could feel it.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.560]   Latency would be the issue.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.800]   Oh, I know what I was going to say.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.720]   We are on a 10 gigabit symmetric--
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.280]   --here in a connection.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   I know.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.040]   And most people know.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.720]   This is an unusually good connection.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.500]   What's that?
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.500]   He's got a shield.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   It looks good just from here, but it's not going to happen at home.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.500]   I don't know.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   Have they solved the latency issues, do you think?
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   That's the real question.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   And can Google's magic fix the latency problems?
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   It's back and still not your--
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.500]   to assuming variables to--
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   Yeah, you can't tell what the jitter and latency is going to be.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.500]   All right, so I'm now regretting canceling it.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.500]   But--
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.500]   You could take a mess.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   OK.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   That was pretty fun.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.500]   It would be fine with that.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.900]   And I played Destiny on Xbox.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.500]   It's very comparable, right?
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.500]   I mean, it was like--
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   But there's no achievements.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.500]   There's no games to get--
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   There's no-- I can't play with anybody else, or can I?
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   You supposedly you can.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.500]   Not from--
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.500]   Only stadium.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.500]   Right now.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.500]   Oh, and have you muted Jeff?
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.500]   I did mute Jeff.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   Oh, yeah, you're sorry.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   You're sorry.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   You know, Jeff's been quiet for like 10 minutes.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.500]   I thought I was sorry.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   Is there a social angle to all this?
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   Sort of.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   Only against other stadium people.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   Only within the stadium.
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.500]   Only within the stadium.
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.500]   Oh.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.500]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:52.500]   The thing that I thought was kind of interesting is you can be watching some of your--
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   you know, somebody who likes YouTube stream and then click the link and join them in game.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   That's not out yet, right?
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.500]   It feels like a big one.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   It's a very typical Google rollout.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   It's beta.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   I agree.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   It first is right, making an invitation only and everybody--
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   then we'd all be saying, "How do I get in?"
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   "Let me in, let me in!"
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   Having everybody test it and pay a premium price for it.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   That's not cool.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.500]   But you'd be wailed to doing.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   True.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   Yeah, and you lost me right at the front.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.500]   The question is when the next gen comes when you're listening.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.500]   Stand next to the microphone there so we can hear you.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.500]   I'm not talking to microphone.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.500]   I don't know where the microphone is.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.500]   You're talking to me.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   You're talking to me.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.500]   Just coming over here.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.500]   Sure.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   When you're looking at buying the next gen like, "Piss 5," that's another $500.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.500]   That's the real decision.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   I could just buy a game and play the free tier, right?
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.500]   Right.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   So, free is next year.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.500]   What will you lose if you're not paying $10 a month?
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.500]   No 4K.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   No 4K.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.500]   Okay.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   You're not getting any.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.500]   You're not getting any.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.500]   Which is probably, probably, you're better off, honestly.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.500]   It would be--
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   Oh, there is a mic.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:06.700]   And the other reason the people-- I think the whole idea for this was that you, Jeff, could
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:11.300]   play it on a Chrome book, not that you want to, but you could, and that we could play it
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.300]   on our Pixel.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.300]   You have to have a Pixel phone to do it, but if you have a Pixel phone, clip and cable
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.300]   not included.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:23.780]   You need some additional hardware, but that's the premise of this, right?
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.700]   Is that low-end hardware could play high-end games.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.700]   But that's not high-end.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.300]   Well, that looked-- what I was just doing, for those of you who couldn't see it on Destiny
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.460]   2, looked pretty good.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.300]   I would say the game experience was decent.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.700]   You know, as good as it-- you know, I would want it to be.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.500]   But 44 titles confirmed.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.620]   Cyberpunk 27 and 7, which is going to be a very hot title.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:48.100]   That will be available Baldur's Gate 3.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.900]   4K with HDR.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   Mortal Kombat.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.700]   Wow, we already have Mortal Kombat 11.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.700]   I don't need that.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   $70.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:06.020]   You know what the-- can I just say what the real problem is?
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.060]   The elephant in the room.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:13.460]   Google kills stuff randomly.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:17.460]   I don't think any gamer wants to invest, because you are investing in a platform.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.700]   I don't think they want to invest in a platform that could go away in months.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.700]   True.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.680]   Real gamers, like Mr. Carson was discussing, they'll go out and spend a couple thousand
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.020]   dollars on a rig just to play the games that they enjoy.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.020]   Let me take a break.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.820]   I want to talk about Nightingale and the Google Healthcare Project, because I'm really curious
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:42.620]   what Jeff and Matthew have to say about that when I was gone when this broke.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.620]   I don't know.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.620]   Do we talk about it last week?
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.620]   We did.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.620]   We did?
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.620]   Okay.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.620]   So that's a terrible tease then.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.620]   None of us was here last week.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.620]   He's a fan.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.620]   You know, Mr.--
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.620]   No, I was--
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.620]   I was here too.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:54.620]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.620]   But you were?
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:56.620]   Oh.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.480]   We'll also talk about-- I know this is news.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.320]   The Supreme Court agreeing to take up Google's appeal versus Oracle.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   Not that that--
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.960]   The case that will never die.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   Never die.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.280]   But a case that was very poorly decided.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.200]   And I think what we have to investigate is what is the Supreme Court going to take up,
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.680]   because this is not the first time the Supreme Court's ruled on this case.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.120]   But first a word from the best browser ever, brave.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.120]   Now you might say no Chrome's the best browser ever.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   Most people use Chrome.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.120]   Well, brave is Chrome.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:35.680]   It's taking the Chrome code base, which is open source, taking out the bad stuff, leaving
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.960]   in the good stuff and adding some really good stuff on top of it.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.280]   It's a next generation web browser built by a team that unlike Google is focused on
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.780]   privacy.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:52.360]   And as a result of securing the browser, you also get amazing speed, much better performance
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.640]   with privacy by default.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.520]   Brave gives you control over who has access to what you're doing online.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:03.040]   And that gives you super fast performance, up to six times faster than the competitors,
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.000]   which also means on a laptop less battery life, it'll reduce data costs.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.120]   I like Brave because it looks like Chrome.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.640]   It supports Chrome extensions, all the Chrome extensions.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   You can use the Chrome Web Store.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.760]   But I don't have to worry about things like ad blocking, tracker blocking.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.560]   In fact, I would say it does a better job of tracking blocking than any other browser,
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.800]   including Firefox.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.200]   Brave is impressive.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.440]   And I've talked to be crypt.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.360]   In fact, we did a triangulation with her.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.440]   She's one of the people who does the security side of Brave.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:40.360]   I know the people on the Brave team like be crypt really are committed to making you have
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:45.160]   a great browser, no sacrifices, but it doesn't have creepy ads.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.000]   It doesn't have trackers.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.440]   Now one of the things I think is really cool.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.240]   One of the, we've talked a lot about this ad blocking and doesn't that just take revenue
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.480]   out of the pockets of ad supported websites?
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   Yes.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.720]   But Brave gives it back.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.200]   Brave rewards you by having advertisers pay you for your attention.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.560]   You can opt into Brave ads, which are very nice, very simple and do not track you.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.600]   And you'll get rewarded with bat tokens, basic attention tokens.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.720]   You know, actually, if you want, you can even buy bat tokens.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:18.280]   And then Brave will award content creators with bat tokens.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.720]   So you could access premium content.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.400]   You can reward your favorite content creators.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   It fixes this issue of how do you do ad blocking and still give publishers their fair share
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.520]   of web revenue.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.520]   I love this.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.960]   This is really innovative thinking.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.240]   And I think they've done a great job.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   Fix the internet.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   That was their mission.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.280]   Brendan Eich, who created JavaScript and was co-founder of Firefox, created Brave with
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.880]   Brian Bondi.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.360]   You get private windows with Tor built in.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.160]   So yes, it's a Tor browser as well.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:52.360]   If you want additional anonymity on the net, HTTPS everywhere.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.360]   I love that.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   I turned that on.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   It's all configurable though.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.560]   If you go to the Brave, do me a favor.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   Download Brave anyway.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   Brave.com/twit.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.040]   I know you have a couple of browsers in your system.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.320]   So add one more.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   Brave.com/twit.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.440]   Then go into the preferences.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.720]   That's where you'll really see Brave in action.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   You'll see all the features.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.600]   You could see that you could turn them all on and off.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.400]   You don't have to use bat if you don't want to.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.200]   You don't have to see Brave ads if you don't want to.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.200]   You can.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   You can configure everything.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.720]   You don't even have to use Google as a search engine.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.920]   I use start pages, my search engine.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.320]   I just really love Brave.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.560]   I feel like I'm getting the Chrome experience without the Chrome cruft.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.200]   In fact, Brave slogan is great.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:35.160]   Yesterday was about Big Tech Today is about us Brave.com/twits.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.200]   The only browser I use.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   I love that.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.000]   Actually, I've been using it for, I think I switched off of Chrome to Brave about six
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   months ago.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.280]   It's a switch easy because it is Chrome.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.360]   And Brave Sync, oh, I love it.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.040]   Because I use Brave on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux and it's available on all of
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.040]   them.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.800]   With Brave Sync, you get strong, secure sync between all of the same.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:01.680]   Even we'll open the same page I was just looking at on my Android device when I get to my desktop.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.240]   I love it.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.320]   Brave.com/twit.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   Please use that address that way.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.960]   They know you saw it here.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.240]   Okay, so is there anything to say about Project Nightingale?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.640]   First question, I wasn't clear.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:22.120]   I also read the story about the NIH giving 100,000 x-rays to Google and Google about
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   to publish them.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   That's a separate thing.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.120]   Separate thing.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.240]   So these both surfaced at the same time.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.280]   Yeah, and I think that--
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.880]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.200]   The thing to remember about Nightingale is that as far as I can tell, all the stuff
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.960]   that Google was doing with this data partner is totally legal.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.920]   Like it's completely allowed--
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   But that's a loop.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.800]   Okay, but I want to say that's a loop poll in HIPAA.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   It was a hip-hop.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.680]   It's a loophole that if you look at it, it was clearly written for insurers.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:58.160]   So that insurers could snoop on you and reduce their liability.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.480]   And the insurance industry went in there and said, "You know, it'd be nice if you'd put
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.720]   that in the HIPAA law."
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.000]   And they did.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.360]   And so, yeah, it's legal, but it's a loop poll on Google's data.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.280]   So there are also the one piece I read.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.520]   I'm trying to remember where it was.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:16.360]   But they said, "These types of data sharing arrangements are commonplace with lots of
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   different companies."
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.400]   And so it's just the fact that it's Google, I think, that got a lot of attention.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.800]   And that's what we said last week.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.440]   There's a lot of other people doing the same type of pool and push for data.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   Let us make it okay.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   We should stop them too.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.280]   Well, it doesn't make it awful either.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.880]   It depends on what happens with it.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   Right.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   But that's what I was saying.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:41.360]   If Google is taking this information and it's going to use it to help, you know, whether
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.880]   it's speed up and make more efficient with diagnosis and process, and maybe that's good
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.960]   things like that, that's a good thing.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:53.200]   If they're going to help us with, you know, finding not necessarily a cure, but something
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.240]   to help with preventative medicine, let them have at it.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:03.120]   They have the horsepower with all of their computing to give us these answers possibly.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.400]   So let them play around with it.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.280]   But Google wanted to provide if everybody knows tools for Ascension Health, which is
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.000]   a big nonprofit provider, thousands of facilities, 23 states.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.880]   And the idea is medical, you know, electronic medical records, everybody wants to move to
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.880]   that.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.880]   That's completely reasonable.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:26.320]   Again, this question is what is, what else is, you know, what is Google going to do that
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   information?
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.960]   Well, what about this the wrong way?
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   Right?
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.520]   We should deal directly with the fears we have about people knowing our health data, right?
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.040]   So you can't cut me off insurance, you can't fire me, you can't do other things.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.560]   That should be legislated.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:44.960]   And then once we feel secure in that, then there is clear benefit from sharing health
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.960]   data.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.840]   So as soon as they legislate that, then Google, you go right ahead.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.200]   But we need to legislate that.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.840]   And, you know, there's a non-discriminatory view on employment and on insurance and on
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:00.480]   running new apartments and things like that, we should not discriminate on the basis of
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.560]   race, sex, gender or illness.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   But we do.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   We do.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.560]   And there was a problem.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.800]   That's the problem with society is that.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:14.480]   And the reason there's that loophole in HIPAA, in my opinion, is so that insurance companies
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.640]   could ultimately decline coverage to people with existing conditions and all, you know,
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.640]   that information.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   What are you wanting up there?
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   The insurance companies tell you that straight up though.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.160]   They tell you that before you even sign up.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   They do, yeah.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   They do.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   We reserve the right to deny it.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.320]   I think we need to know more.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:35.520]   I think it would be better if we knew more about these kind of data sharing arrangements.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:40.160]   It's not necessarily outlaw them, but at least know that this stuff is happening.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   I agree.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.160]   I think the problem started.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.600]   Who's got our data and from where?
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:49.080]   I think the problem started when it came off as if Google was trying to keep this information
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.720]   away from the public.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.680]   Had they just said straight up folks, we're trying to find a better way to help you all
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.680]   out.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:02.000]   So we're working with these folks to help get the data and we're going to go through it.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   We're going to keep it private.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.520]   We're going to lock it down, but we just want you to know we have some of your personal
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.720]   information for a big question.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.880]   Yeah, I saw so many headlines that said Google is trying to secretly get health data.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880]   Right.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   And no matter what they do, they're going to get smashed.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.840]   That's the problem is that if your comms at Google, you are trying to make another story
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:30.440]   that drove me bat poop this last week was the Wall Street Journal of Google changes
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   the algorithm.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:37.560]   And let's do 5600 inches of text about how changes it's all.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.040]   That was a terrible story.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.640]   So it was awful.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   And there's a, I won't say his name because I don't give him the credit, but there's a
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:51.080]   trade association guy in the publishing industry who spends his entire life now smashing Facebook
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   and Google.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.160]   And I criticize, you know, it is.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   I criticize this story.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.680]   He got all after me.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.640]   Oh, a lot of renowned Google critics.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.120]   I know said, what a ridiculous story.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:10.520]   No, it's ridiculous because I thought Greg Sterling and Barry Schwartz did a really good
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.080]   job of going through all like point by point.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:19.440]   So anybody who listens to show it can immediately understand the problem.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   This is the headline from the Wall Street Journal, how Google interferes the search.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.200]   I can't even say it with a straight face.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.640]   Interferes for the search algorithms and shocking changes your results.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   It uses black lists, algorithm tweaks and an army of contractors to shape what you see.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:43.960]   Well, hell yeah, the same company, the Murdoch Wall Street Journal was scathing about Google,
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.160]   you know, not doing that.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.480]   So they wanted them to change their own.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:53.760]   So this is a hit piece from a from and you can expect this from newspapers because well,
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.120]   and also from that particular newspaper with that particular owner.
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.880]   Yeah, but it's interesting how if you took all the adjectives out, it's actually just
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.640]   a straightforward description of how search works.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   Right.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   Yes.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   Exactly.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   What it's supposed to do.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.120]   Oh my God, look how search works.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.320]   Google made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big businesses over smaller
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:19.200]   ones and at least in one case, made changes on behalf of a major advertiser.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.920]   Yeah, but what were the changes that made?
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   What did it say?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.120]   Oh, eBay should be higher up.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.320]   No, the changes were.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:29.400]   Let's make sure that the people that results people want show up.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.840]   Google engineers regularly make behind the scenes adjustments to other information.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.600]   The company is increasingly layering on top of its basic search results.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.280]   The knowledge panels, the featured snippets.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.160]   Again, if you've used Google, and this is one of the reasons people use Google, is because
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.360]   you get all that edition.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.240]   You get the Wikipedia article on the right.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.680]   I mean, there is a question, there is a sort of debate to be had about Google doing things
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.840]   like, you know, privilege and so on property and we could talk about that, but that's not
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.840]   enough.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.120]   Well, the stage is doing that and your anti-trust.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120]   Right.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.040]   While in the Wall Street Journal, go after the likes of YouTube because YouTube pretty
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.000]   much does the same thing with this algorithm far as trying to show what exactly this particular
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.720]   profile has a history of looking at and clicking like on and watching the full duration.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.320]   I don't want to be a Google apologist and I'm sure that's how it sounds to some people.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:31.960]   So honestly, is this article revealing, and by the way, they said they interviewed 100
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:40.040]   people, is this article revealing anything that we didn't know?
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   No.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   Okay.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   Not really.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.040]   I can't look for it.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.680]   It's just casting things that we knew in an unfavourable.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   That's what it's doing.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.160]   And yes, we're in a different perspective too.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.680]   We're in the tech bubble, if you will.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.680]   So we're going to see this bull crap as it's printed out there, but a lot of people will
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.160]   read this and go, "Oh, did you know?"
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   Right.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.160]   Everybody's going to freak out.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:08.320]   Especially this aligns with the conservatives who said all along, Google is deprecating the
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.520]   conservative search results.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.360]   And while it never says that here, objectivity, neutrality.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:20.000]   I guarantee, yeah, I guarantee there will be a bill before Congress that we use the term
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   search neutrality.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   Yes.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.280]   I think there already are efforts.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   Yes.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.960]   So there's two other things Google's doing to gather more data.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.200]   A lot of this is slanted by your view of Google, right?
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.560]   So Google bought Fitbit and a lot of Fitbit people are throwing their Fitbits in the trash.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   Well, Google know how many steps I took.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   Yes.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   They already know, dude.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.760]   But even if you carry an Android phone, they know.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.960]   Your Android phone knows.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.760]   I do think though, because I've heard that we had this discussion, I had this discussion
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.080]   with a friend of mine who has a Fitbit.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:03.360]   And it's just sort of a free-floating fear or a moral panic.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:11.600]   They're data getting loose somehow or big companies knowing about it or, and there's
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   nothing tangible.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.680]   Like you can't really pin it down.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.080]   It's just this kind of fear.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.720]   You're right, Matthew, and it's the problem with the online harms report in the UK where
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.240]   they're saying that things that are harmful, that could, I don't know, we're not going
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   to say what it is.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.480]   But if it possibly could be harmful, we're going to go.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.880]   I just wanted to talk about this on the show.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.720]   I talked about the book a few weeks ago.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.240]   So I put up a long post saying that harmful speech is the new porn.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.160]   So I got an amazing book from 1970 that went into the Presidential Commission on Pornography
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160]   at the time.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160]   And the parallels are amazing.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.640]   I was like, "Porn is going to ruin our youth."
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.360]   Well, we're still here.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.560]   That's all it does.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.560]   You know, we're okay.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   We're okay.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   It didn't hurt us.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560]   It didn't hurt us.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   Most of us.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560]   Most of us.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.120]   Sometimes I feel like, Jeff, though, you kind of lean towards everything's fine and
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.200]   don't maybe ignore potential harms.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.960]   If you can define the harm, fine.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.960]   That's my problem with what Matthew was just saying.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.120]   Well, I could define plenty of harms with porn.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.800]   So the UK harm report is not good at that.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.880]   They just say, "Some things are harmful and you should stop them."
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.640]   You want to be specific.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.880]   Because on the other side of it, there's harms to stopping data aggregation because there
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.960]   are benefits to it.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:41.880]   So what you want to do is, as best you can, weigh real legitimate harms with real legitimate
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.000]   values and see what the tradeoff is.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.600]   But we still rarely do that now.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:52.760]   Well, I have to say, there is some culpability on the part of Google because, for instance,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.440]   Google didn't tell people they were doing this deal with Ascension.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.920]   There's no patient acknowledging.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   They did, actually.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   It was a job.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   Well, they told people, you're right, on the fact that they told them on an investor call,
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.120]   but they didn't give the patients a chance to opt out.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:11.200]   In other words, I think there's some culpability on both sides.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.040]   That's a breath of comms issue.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.640]   It is a comms issue.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.920]   It's also, but it's not merely a comms issue.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.760]   It's also a settings issue.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.040]   It's also a default issue.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.840]   It's Google needs to mourn more do what Apple does, which is we've got to get permission
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840]   before you do anything.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.680]   Well, let's not get too wooshy about a virtuous Apple.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.320]   Apple made a business failure into a feature.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.080]   The fact that Apple failed in advertising.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.720]   Yeah, it didn't launch.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.080]   And so it didn't really need the data.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.280]   And so now it's making that into a feature, but Apple's no.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.520]   It's a real feature.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.480]   Well, for whatever...
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   It's a dental.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.360]   Yeah, so, okay.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.560]   Maybe their motives weren't pure as the driven snow, but now that they can't make money
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.400]   in advertising, they're not going to be collecting the information.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   I think more...
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.280]   If I could put my finger on sort of the fear, I think more and more people are concerned
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.160]   that or afraid that all of these things that Google and Facebook and other companies say
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:17.320]   they're doing for us, that most of the benefit is going to go to them.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:25.560]   So that maybe the fear that they're going to maybe do this much for you and then this
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560]   much for that...
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.000]   Well, here's what Google said.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.480]   The most of the data will help them.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.440]   Our work with Ascension is exactly that.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.880]   A business arrangement to help a provider, Ascension, with the latest technology similar
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.760]   to the same thing we do with dozens of other healthcare providers.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.640]   These organizations like Ascension use Google to securely manage their patient data under
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.280]   strict privacy and security standards.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.200]   They are the stewards of the data.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.000]   We provide suruses on their behalf.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.320]   And I have to say, when they say it that way, it sounds to me like this is a tempest in a
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.360]   teapot that there is no problem.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.360]   It's like...
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.800]   They want to do this same thing for the CIA.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   But...
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.720]   Well, but another way to put it is how much of your data is on AWS?
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Right.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   Or all of these.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:14.160]   Yes, tons of it because it's in all kinds of places and we've figured them out not
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   to put it together but it's in the cloud.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.320]   I don't knock people first saying, "Hey, I don't want them to know my data because
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.160]   they're going to capitalize off their rate and make a gazillion dollars off of it and
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.360]   they're not going to make anything."
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.680]   I don't have a problem with that.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.920]   I do have a problem with people just being flat out fearful and not knowing why.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.520]   Well, and I think our larger complaint is...
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520]   I think we all agree.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.320]   Everybody should have the right to choose yesterday.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:53.720]   The larger complaint is if Congress, the FCC, Rupert Murdoch, whoever weighs in and shuts
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:59.240]   stuff down that would give us absolute societal benefit on the basis of these imaginary or
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:06.120]   hard to define harms, then the harm really is that we lost the benefits of these technological
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   innovations.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:15.880]   And I think Jeff had a point that if you trace the fear, it is that Google or Facebook is
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:21.560]   going to take the data and give it to somebody and then that somebody is going to penalize
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.960]   you in some way.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   Your insurance is going to cut off or your bank's going to shut down your account or
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   something.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   Right.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.640]   Which is a matter of...
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:38.080]   So in my regulation group I was in, I got everybody yelling at me when I said that we're
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.080]   not...
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.360]   The issue here really isn't regulation of technology companies at all.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.320]   It's regulating the human behavior that the technology companies enable that we don't
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.520]   like.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.560]   And yes, technology companies do things too and they have user power.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.400]   But a lot of what people complain about is that there's things we don't approve of that
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.760]   we want the technology companies to get rid of.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   Right.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.720]   Well, there's things that other companies do that we want them to because they seem all
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.560]   powerful now.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.920]   And I think that's part of the problem is we give them too much credit.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.520]   I think also the problem is that we give the notion that we are reasonable too much credit
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.560]   that we really all act via our motion.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.440]   And really what's happened here is that the tides have turned on Google, which we used
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.400]   to think was the greatest thing ever.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.120]   And now everybody's doesn't trust it and like it.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   And so that's all.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.720]   Just as the deal is being overboarded.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   I love with it.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.720]   It's a company.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   It's a company.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   It's a company.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720]   So that's...
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   It's really emotion.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.000]   It's really how you feel about Google that really colors this period.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.040]   It doesn't help when these companies start offering facial recognition to the military
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:46.280]   for their drone strikes or when they start offering back doors to China or whatever.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   That stuff doesn't help.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.280]   Well, okay.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.840]   I'm going to recast that.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.600]   Let me recast that.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.600]   This is America.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   Well, you're in Canada.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   But this is America.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600]   It's the same difference.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:02.840]   If this were World War II and Ford said, "Let's build tanks," we'd say, "Yes, you're patriotic."
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.720]   This is something, again, this is emotional.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:13.600]   It is a long history of American companies building products for our defense or our offense.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.360]   It's a long history that there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.800]   Amazon, Jeff Bezos said, "If the military wants..."
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.640]   But tanks didn't roll into your neighborhood.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   They didn't follow you to the 7-11.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   Oh, look at you, they are.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   Like that facial recognition.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.800]   Well, that your problem is not with Amazon or your problem is with the US military using
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.120]   drone strikes.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.640]   That's a different problem now.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.840]   No, it's technologies like facial recognition that can be used in different tanks.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.560]   You use a tank in one way.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.240]   You face a recognition if that's technology start.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.440]   But I got a truss.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.680]   I'm going to trust our great, wonderful military that is going to use this in an
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   as sensible, appropriate way to defend this great nation of ours.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.160]   And what the hell is wrong with Google helping them out?
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160]   All freaking out.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.160]   All freaking out.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.040]   The problem is the leader.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.640]   The problem is the leader of the military.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.920]   Well, they're trying to...
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.400]   Trust in that.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.720]   So not just military, but also immigration and naturalization.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.600]   So I came through, I mean, I have global entry, which is the machine.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.000]   You put the passport in and you answer a few questions.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   And then you go, right?
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   A-ah.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   They changed it.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.320]   Now you come in, it is facial recognition only.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   Take a picture of me.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.320]   It says you are Jeffree Jarvis.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.400]   But you gave them that face when you signed up for global entry.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.000]   Well, I didn't know it was facial recognition.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Well, so...
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   I don't agree.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   I'm a freak.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   I mean...
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   But it's pretty amazing now.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   So if you want to freak people out about how good facial recognition is, have them go through
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   it, I'm saying it's going to freak people out.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.040]   I have a slightly off-subject question.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.960]   If we look at regulation and the people in our leadership that are wanting to put this
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:08.800]   type of regulation on Google or whatever tech company that they have an issue with, should
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.720]   these people be people that are well-versed in the sciences, like computer sciences, or
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.600]   have degrees in that, or is it okay that they just have people under them that understand
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   this technology?
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   I want ignorant idiots to run the world.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.600]   But you can't demand that everybody in Congress has a degree in computers.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   I know what they have to have.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600]   They have staff and they can get things right.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600]   Right.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.600]   I saw someone, I guess it was on Twitter, someone had put that out there.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.600]   It was like, "I need our leadership to be people that are competent in computer sciences
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600]   and engineering and yada yada yada."
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.600]   That's why we used to have the office, what was it called, the office of technology?
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.600]   Technology.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600]   Technology.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.200]   Gingrich killed it in the '80s.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:55.960]   Actually, at least some of the candidates for president have asked or encouraged, "I
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.520]   know Elizabeth Warren has the return of that office of technology and whatever it was."
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.960]   I just like them to be human beings.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:10.840]   I'd like them to be functioning, thinking, emotional human beings that don't require
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.040]   an scientific degree.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.960]   I think he or she, whoever that posted it, I think they were thinking more along the
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:25.760]   lines of, "We don't want the speaker to be at the mic saying, well asking Zuckerberg
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.040]   why his iPhone wasn't working."
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040]   That type of thing.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   I mean, that is ugly.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040]   But you know what?
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.040]   It's always been staffers moving the smart people.
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.880]   The member of Congress is there just to raise funds and get votes.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.400]   The staff is what does all the work.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.000]   Those hearings are all about getting on TV and making grandstanding.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.920]   You hold up your cardboard cutout or whatever.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920]   Talk about your...
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:55.880]   By the way, it was the Office of Technology Assessment, 1972-1995.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:02.240]   It was designed to provide Congress, its members and committees with objective and authoritative
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.640]   analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.280]   The fact that it was disbanded is unwillingly...
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.240]   We need more and more now.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.600]   Just as Netscape and public have dismantled.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600]   It's really sad.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.480]   I fear though, if it comes back, it's going to come back.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.440]   And every possible technology that's bad for you.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.600]   We're in the finger-wagging age.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.080]   It was killed because Newt Gingrich decided it was hostile to GOP interests.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080]   Oh, geez.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.080]   What are those?
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.080]   I don't know.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.200]   Well, all these climate talk.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.800]   I don't know.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.560]   One more thing you can get mad about.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.920]   Google wants to start checking account for you.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.120]   Next year, Google wants to be your new bank.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.200]   I'm actually pretty fine with that.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.920]   We talked about that last week.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920]   Oh, you did.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.480]   Oh, I'm bringing back all the old stuff.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.160]   I don't trust them any less than I trust my bank.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   Right.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.160]   That's true.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160]   That's true.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.160]   That's true.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.520]   And that's what he said is like, "Who do you trust at least?"
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   I got no.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.480]   Yesterday in the mail.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.960]   I got a box of candy from a company called PurePoint Financial and said, "Happy birthday,
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   Leo."
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960]   Oh, boy.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.880]   What the hell are these guys?
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   What?
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   Is it your birthday?
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.000]   It's my birthday's coming up.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.320]   I thought, "That's a little weird."
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.520]   Fortunately, it turns out, Lisa said, "Oh, no.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.520]   We have an account with them."
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.320]   I said, "Oh, I didn't know that."
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   Okay.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   Someone was scraping.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:35.600]   Well, this is one way to get me to set up a checking account.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.080]   Happy birthday to me.
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   I can't eat the candy.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.880]   If they'd known me better, they'd send me some meat.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880]   There you go.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   Obviously, they don't know me well enough.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   There's a box of meat.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.240]   What's the name of the candy?
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.480]   I think we're going to re-gifted as stocking stuffers.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.680]   It could give me my address.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.040]   It's pretty funny, though.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   It was nicely packaged.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.240]   An PowerPoint or whoever, if they want to send some boxes of candy, yeah.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240]   PurePoint Financial.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.360]   They'll find you, Miss Deane.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   The reason it turns out--
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   It's like a good candy or something.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.400]   Lisa created a-- yeah, it was a pretty good candy.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   I didn't eat it.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.880]   But Lisa set up a savings account with them because they have the highest savings rate.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.600]   It's like 0.18 or something.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.040]   1.8 or something like that.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   Anyway, yeah, 1.8.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.600]   By the way, how hard was it for you to stay on your diet on vacation?
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   Oh, I didn't.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.600]   Oh, no.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   That was going to exist.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.480]   Oh, it would have been impossible.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.280]   People in Greece would have been slapping you around.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   Oh, there you go.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.520]   For those who don't know, I don't eat carbs.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.240]   I'm on a keto diet.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.720]   But yeah, I mean, I had a little pita bread.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:36.720]   I had some hummus.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.400]   I heard there was some nice pastries.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   I did not know.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   You know what?
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   I was pretty good.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.440]   I didn't do desserts for the most part of these pastries.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   And they're short on them at least.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440]   And not have pastries.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:50.240]   But I did, you know, the ship they had fresh baked rolls every day, I thought, I don't
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240]   have one of those.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   So how did it feel?
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   I haven't seen that car.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:59.880]   Actually, the worst thing was our cabin was mere feet away from a very good pizzeria on
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.160]   the boat, spock-anopoli.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160]   And the guy was Italian.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160]   I'd say, "Bunjonno."
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160]   He said, "Bunjonno."
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160]   I have a pizza.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.160]   I couldn't really say no.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160]   Oh, Lord.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:16.240]   I'm going to try to add the pizza joints around here.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.240]   Just walk in and say, "Bunjonno."
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.240]   "Bunjonno."
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   Give me a...
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   Well, that's a nice thing about a cruise.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.240]   You're already paid for everything.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.240]   Through the nose.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.160]   So it's like it's free.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.960]   It's sort of...
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.440]   It's sort of like it's free.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.680]   They're not going to do a TJIF meeting.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.200]   is a sign of a company becoming big, they're cutting back on the all hands
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.120]   means just one situation. I never worked for
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.280]   a company that had all hands meetings every
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.840]   week. Yeah, that's a a Google
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.720]   transparent.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:51.600]   The axon is not having no, we don't even transparency, we actually, we do.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.080]   But we don't have a new slide, like it. Yeah, but it's a very Silicon Valley
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.140]   thing, we have a Wednesday all hands, meeting lunch, but we're
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:02.040]   a small or two or Tuesday all hands, but we're smaller. Yeah, we can get all hands
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.780]   in one room. Right. Yeah, I've worked for a company. We have all hands meetings,
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:12.200]   but it wasn't every week. It was more like twice a year at the most I've seen
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:19.600]   once a quarter. So I think that's the I think that's the the slant on this is
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.640]   Oh, you know, there was a lot of dissent at these meetings. People would ask
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.540]   tough questions and then people would leak the public for those people said,
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:34.620]   I don't, you know, I just find it interesting that Facebook, which is,
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:40.580]   which is known for being incredibly secretive and closed mouth when they had
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:44.580]   leaks from an audio, like audio leaks from a meeting. Yeah,
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.220]   then Zuckerberg said, okay, like we'll have public meetings that and Google,
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:52.900]   who has typically been pretty transparent, they had leaks and so now they're
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.560]   just not having meetings. Well, or maybe they're just not having me because it's
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:00.800]   not practical. I don't, I'm not sure. Yeah. When you, when you were all in
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.840]   Mountain View and you can stand on a staircase. Yeah, pretty cool. But
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:11.640]   so Karsten son is worried that the FTC is going to find him $42,000.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:15.640]   Yeah, I want to hear more about this. He's completely freaked out. Like so
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:21.600]   how old is he? He's 16. He's 15. 15. He has, he's had a YouTube channel for
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.720]   about a year. And all of his content is kind of video game related.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:34.240]   So it's aimed at kids his age. Yeah. But it's not like aimed at kids,
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.480]   kids. The thing is Zach is not gathering information about the people
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:45.440]   who watch his channel. YouTube is, but YouTube is telling its creators,
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:53.160]   it's your problem. You have to declare that you are kid. There were two
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:59.000]   ways you could be kid attractive or you could be kid targeted. And in
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.560]   if you don't declare it right, you're the one the FTC is going to find.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.640]   They're not going to find us. But who's gathering the information?
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:11.240]   YouTube. Zach doesn't know anything about his audience. Not yet.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.720]   So this comes from Coppa, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.000]   The FTC had a press conference in September.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:29.240]   And I don't care what kids are trying to find about their find on Google.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:35.000]   So if none of our programs are aimed at kids, right, but maybe some of our,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.960]   but what if we did unboxing videos of toys that would be considered
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.560]   kid attractive in either case, you have to declare that it has to do with your
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.680]   monetization. If you're a kid directed, you can't monetize, you can't have ads.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:53.320]   But again, it's not because you're getting any information because Google keeps
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:58.360]   that all close to the vest. It's almost just like saying that you're not a kid
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.440]   attractive, you'll be safer. But then if you are and you say you're not,
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:08.440]   that's when you get the $42,000 fine. That's what he's worried about.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.640]   Yeah. Under terms of the settlement with the FTC, YouTube made a settlement.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:18.360]   YouTube is required to quote, "develop, implement and maintain a system for channel
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.800]   owners, Zach, to designate whether their content on the YouTube service is directed
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:28.160]   to children, creators who strictly make children's content can have their entire
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.200]   channel designated as directed to children.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:37.040]   But even if you only make one video, your channel may be designated that.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:42.200]   And then once a video is labeled as kids content, all the personalized ads are
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.760]   shut off and they're replaced with quote, contextualized advertising, in other
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.680]   words, advertising that's designed for people who might watch that kind of content.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.760]   Like our ads, our ads are contextualized.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.920]   We don't gather information about our audience.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:58.440]   I think you're right, Leo. I think it's unfair to put all this on the creators.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:03.240]   Like it says in their video, YouTube explicitly declined to tell channel owners
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.360]   when to label a video. We can't provide legal advice.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.640]   It's it. We're unable to confirm whether your content is made.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.920]   My comment is important.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.680]   You don't label it right. Good luck.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.280]   Yep. Thanks.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.360]   You're as a grass.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   Outstanding.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.240]   So I think we're not kid directed.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.080]   I don't think we could be kid attractive.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Could be kid attractive.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.600]   We're talking about candy.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.920]   You were just talking about candy.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:35.840]   Kids is what's in candy. Who is all we see is a cop a survey.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.440]   Subject matter if you have.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.280]   Subject man is appealing to children.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.800]   For example, kids jokes.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.240]   Well, most of mine are childish music.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.920]   Kids games, video computer games.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.040]   Oh, I like how they talk.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.360]   Oh, you can't appeal either.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.160]   You can't appeal.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:53.840]   You can't.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.600]   Children's TV shows or stars, cartoon characters, sports.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.680]   Sports.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.720]   Stories, toys, children's books, fantasy.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:07.040]   Well, most of the show is children's art and crafts.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:07.960]   Pets.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.800]   You mean, if I had a pet channel, they would call that crap.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800]   We showed those cats.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.560]   Products primarily purchased or consumed by kids like snack food.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.800]   Everybody buys snack food.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   Only kids buy snacks.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   And we can't use slang or pop culture.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800]   Phrasing.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.800]   Slang or pop culture phrases like.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Whatever.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.800]   Free stuff.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800]   Fun.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.800]   Duh.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   Ask your parents.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.800]   And no bold or bright, vibrant colors.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.800]   Whatever I'm going to say.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:43.800]   I'm going to fix it right here.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.800]   I'm going to throw in a phrase like nihilistic epistemology.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   There you go.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   No kid.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   You won that.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   No, we're good.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   We're safe.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   We're not good.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.800]   Okay.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   That's just so title.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   All right.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.720]   Let's take a break and get your pics of the week.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.880]   This has been a lot of fun.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:05.880]   Thank you everybody.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:06.880]   How would it be?
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   Back in the saddle.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.440]   Actually, I had a long conversation this morning with Paul and Mary Jo.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:17.520]   I realized that the only reason I like to travel is because this is actually a flaw
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:20.440]   in the human brain.
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.400]   Your normal daily life becomes humdrum.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   It's the same.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.400]   It's routinized.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   But not this is.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.760]   And your brain is trained once something is routine, ignore it because you're supposed
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.480]   to be looking for the jaguar that's about to eat your brains.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   So you're looking for novelty.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]   We're trained for novelty.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.080]   And I realize there's no novelty in my life.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.480]   There's very little novelty.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.880]   I do much the same thing every week.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880]   Right.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:52.240]   And in fact, that's why I am feeding dopamine to my brain by buying stuff, you know, or trying
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.560]   to do new things.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.080]   When you travel, it's all new.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.080]   It's all different.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.520]   It's very exciting, very stimulating.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:05.120]   And so the temptation is to look at daily life as being undesirable, boring, and I just
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.840]   want to be on the road all the time.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.240]   But then I realized I really don't want to be on the road.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.560]   No, I take it from somebody who does 200,000 miles.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.520]   And I like to be with you guys.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.480]   I love the conversation.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:16.960]   I love.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.560]   I missed the brain food because I was kind of turning into a vegetable.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.560]   I want more pizza.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.560]   You're a big big child.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]   You're just giving it to some cars.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   You're fine.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   Can I have some more pizza?
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.560]   Oh, joy.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.560]   No, I know.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   Windows are the pay open.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.320]   Oh, that's the funniest thing that happens on a cruise.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.280]   It's like people haven't been fed.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.120]   They have a midnight chocolate buffet and people storm it like they have.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120]   They didn't need anything.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120]   Oh, man.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   Three hours ago.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120]   We eat constantly.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120]   Oh, you're on a boat.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   You're on a boat.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120]   What else are you going to do?
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.120]   All right.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120]   Get a massage.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.120]   Get in the hot tub.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   Yes.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120]   Have a dinner.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   Casino.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120]   Second dinner.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   Casino.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.120]   Gamblesome.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.280]   Anyway, I am thrilled to be back and I missed you guys.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280]   You missed you.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.120]   My job, I realized in life that the crew did do a great job.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   Oh, no.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.120]   You know what?
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.120]   This is the first time we've been on vacation.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.800]   We went on a long one, 25 days, where we felt like everything was in great shape, even
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.720]   though there were fires and there was all sorts of issues because we knew we had Ant
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.920]   Pruitt, Micah Sargent, Jason Howell, and the front.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.120]   We had the great people in the back like John and thank goodness for the engineers.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.520]   And of course, our continuity department, Debbie and all those other people.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.720]   I don't know their names.
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.520]   They're great too.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:37.320]   They know who they are.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.920]   No, I know their names.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.920]   They're all wonderful.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.920]   Ash, we want to walk out of there.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.320]   They're going to be throwing rocks in.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.520]   And our accounting department of Robin, who's the newest, our newest employee.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.800]   And just because we could count on them, Lisa and I had a much better vacation.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.320]   We knew everything's a great hand.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.320]   That's good stuff.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.320]   So thank you to everybody.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.320]   I really appreciate it.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.320]   It was our pleasure.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.720]   And I miss talking with people like you and Jeff and Matthew.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.520]   And you know, and when Stacy comes back next week, it'll be great to see her again.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.320]   Because honestly, I miss Wiggin' Gotham.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.320]   Wiggin' Gotham.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320]   Yes.

[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   You crossed the wigs.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720]   You crossed the wigs.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:15.720]   You crossed the wigs.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.720]   And everything.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.720]   You crossed the wigs.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.720]   I'm a big fan of that.

[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:22.720]   I'm a big fan of that.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.720]   I'm a big fan of that.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:24.720]   I'm a big fan of that.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.720]   I'm a big fan of that.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.720]   I'm a big fan of that.

[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   I'm a big fan of that.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.720]   Hey, one more commercial by a great company.
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.040]   Brand new advertiser on the show, Metallic is a Commvault venture.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.200]   This week in Google brought to you by Metallic.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:44.440]   Metallic brings you a powerful enterprise grade backup and recovery technology.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.320]   It does it through a simple SaaS delivery.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.560]   It's easy for you to get Metallic up and running.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.800]   It's built on Commvault's core technology.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.960]   That means you're getting fast, secure backups and something I really like.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.480]   Granular restores.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.160]   Data loss, it's a thing of the past with Metallic.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:06.240]   It's unique in that it scales across multiple workloads and still mitigates the risk of
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.440]   data loss.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.880]   It mitigates security threats, other issues like losing access to data in office.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.680]   That's the worst, Microsoft Office 365.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.680]   Azure is down.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:16.680]   What do we do?
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.600]   Or just poor backup performance.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.600]   Metallic offers default storage.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.000]   It's available through Azure or you can roll your own.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.520]   It has capability to backup, recovery and migration from on-premises to the cloud.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.040]   Some of the products Metallic offers are core backup and recovery.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.760]   You could protect physical and virtual servers on-premises and in the cloud with comprehensive
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:42.640]   backup and recovery for VMware, file servers on Windows, file servers on Linux, Microsoft
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.960]   SQL databases.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.440]   That's Metallic core backup and recovery.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:52.040]   If you're an Office 365 house, you'll love Metallic Office 365 backup and recovery.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:55.320]   That's everything, your mailboxes, your contacts, your calendar items.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:01.560]   Whether they're in SharePoint online, Exchange online, on OneDrive, unlimited Azure storage,
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.800]   unlimited retention.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.160]   I know a lot of businesses, that's a legal requirement.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:08.400]   That's a nice thing to have.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.800]   No data ever will be lost.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.040]   Metallic endpoint backup and recovery lets you back up desktop and laptop data to protect
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.960]   against deletion, corruption or the biggest bane these days in business, ransomware and
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.600]   other malicious attacks.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   All your data is secured with encryption, geo location.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.920]   You have remote wipe functionality as well.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.200]   With Metallic, you'll be up and running in as little as 15 minutes and you'll get simpler

[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:20.880]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.880]   Just sign up for Disney Plus.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.080]   Yeah, because it was free with all you ever write in subscription.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.280]   No, I have Verizon too.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.280]   I should probably check that out.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.360]   That was the only reason I just go online and say, "Turn that on."
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.840]   Just go to Verizon and say, "Hey, watch it on your phone."
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.840]   No, sir.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.480]   You can watch it on any device.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.240]   Is the Mandalorian any good?
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   Haven't watched it yet.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:43.240]   What?
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.080]   I'm interested I've been in Disney Plus.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.120]   I know so many people got Disney Plus and have yet to watch a single show.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.400]   It's more like, I will say this, I turned on Star Wars and New Hope because it was an
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.800]   Ultra HD and HDR and so forth.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.720]   I don't have an HDR TV, but when you look at it and see how digitally remastered it is,
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.720]   it's beautiful.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:04.040]   But that is not your thing today.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.040]   No, that's not your thing.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.760]   Your thing today is all about cleansing.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.000]   Actually, no.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   It's not.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000]   Nope, it's not.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:18.080]   It's really about Mr. Lawson Swan, been a fan of the Twit Network forever and ever and
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080]   a day.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.080]   Yay.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.720]   And told me himself, "Leo Le Port inspired me."
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.680]   And I don't know who it was.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:30.280]   He started Clemson Sports Talk.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   That's why.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.560]   Back in 2004 with the $20 headset started a podcast.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.560]   He's like this.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560]   This is huge.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.560]   And he's now about 20,000 followers on Twitter.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:48.000]   I Heart Radio sponsors the whole nine yards sideline at the game.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.520]   And he's really, really doing it up.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:53.600]   And it's all because you inspired him.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.600]   Why?
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   It's good to see you.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.600]   It was his name a lot.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.600]   Lot and Swan.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:02.360]   And by the way, I see Clemson is now 11 and 0 and won the last game against Wake Forest
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.160]   52 to 3.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.120]   Yeah, that's been knusted.
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.560]   Why did they let Wake Forest get that simple field goal?
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:09.560]   You should have stopped them.
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.560]   Yeah, we didn't do so high.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:19.680]   In addition to Mr. Lawton, he wanted to send this over.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.320]   And one of them is an extra, extra large.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.000]   And one of them is an extra large.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.360]   So clearly the double X is for you.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.840]   He doesn't know about my keto diet.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.800]   This is for the post-cruise.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.800]   Nice.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.760]   National champions.
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:35.760]   That's awesome.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.360]   But he sent that while you were out.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.560]   And you know who loves it?
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.560]   He wanted to share it.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.200]   Warwick loves this college ball.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.280]   I'll save the XXL for you, John.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.080]   Ashley, no one is mine.
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.880]   Are you XL or XXL?
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.600]   I'm the two X, clearly.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.240]   Thank you.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.240]   Thank you, Lawton.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   Thank you so much, Dan.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.240]   Thank you.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.440]   Matthew Ingram, Columbia Journalism Review.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.960]   You have anything to share with us?
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.320]   Yeah, I thought this was amazing.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:15.720]   This was in the rundown as well, I think, that it looks like they've made yet another
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.520]   change to the hand and Greedo shooting scene.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:24.080]   Speaking of Disney+, this is actually on Disney+.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.080]   Right?
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.080]   Yes.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.000]   So according to this, Greedo yells something now, just before he shoots.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.880]   So it's not captioned, but as far as everybody can tell, he says, "McClunky."
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.800]   Oh, what does "McClunky" mean, anything?
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.480]   So no one knows.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.480]   OK.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.200]   So this is a George Lucas edit, right?
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.920]   This is something George said.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.480]   He's just trolling people now.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480]   Like he's just flatter trolling people.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.600]   And in this edit, Greedo shot first.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.600]   Right.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.440]   So Han Solo is not a bad guy.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.160]   He was shooting in self-defense.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.160]   OK.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:05.280]   I started watching this, but I stopped before I got to this scene because I just wanted
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.400]   to see what it looked like.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.160]   But now I'm going to have to dive in just to hear "McClunky."
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.880]   This scene has been changed so many times.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.560]   I can see George Lucas sitting around with a bunch of guys.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.800]   He's had a bunch of scotch.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:22.080]   Someone's like, "Let's just have a quick go-yell something in conference."
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.640]   And then everybody's going to head this.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.680]   Is there somewhere we can hear this?
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:29.400]   No, no, it's a clip.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   No.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.400]   We probably shouldn't do it.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.400]   We're probably shouldn't.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   George is just--
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.400]   Oh, sure.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   George is just OK.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.400]   That's very used.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.400]   Come on.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.400]   No.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   I think it's true.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400]   No.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   No.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.400]   You're true.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   Traumatic analysis.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.400]   No.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.400]   No.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.400]   OK.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.400]   We just don't want to take it down.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400]   All right.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.400]   Isn't that sad this world we live in?
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   Now there's a harm.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   That's not imaginary.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   Freedom of expression.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.400]   OK.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.400]   So the good news is, Matthew, you've given us the title for the show today.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:05.400]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, what's your pick of the week, sir?
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:06.840]   Well, we got a number here.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.960]   I got two things.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:16.400]   One is black Friday deals have arrived with a prestige pre-- for Google, the Google store.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.720]   You can get $200 off a Pixel 4 or 4 or--
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.120]   Oh my God.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.040]   This is so annoying.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.040]   This is so annoying.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.040]   But Mr. LaPorte.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.880]   I bought this phone a few weeks ago.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:36.160]   We were two weeks after getting the announcement and it were already discounts of a couple
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.800]   hundred bucks.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:44.840]   You can get a hundred bucks off the 3A and 3A XL near $2.99.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.840]   That's an amazing phone for that price, phenomenal phone.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.120]   You know, get the 3A.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.000]   That's actually for $2.99, yes.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   It's really, really, really great.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.360]   And really, these are what the Nexus prices used to be.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.160]   This is what Google should have always done with these phones.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.160]   Agreed.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.160]   They shouldn't be premium price.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.360]   They should be affordably priced to get people into the ecosystem.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.880]   You could save up to $648 on a Pixel Slate.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.880]   I wonder why.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   I wonder why.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.880]   So it's on sale for--
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.640]   That's the other thing that it may be as--
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:15.640]   Pixel Books go on sale.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   It's supposed to be one sale.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.840]   How about the grippy bottom Pixel--
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:19.840]   No, it's not.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:20.840]   It's not.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:21.840]   It's not.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:22.840]   I might have--
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:23.840]   You know, I'm sitting at the grippy bottom.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.840]   It's never going sale.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.800]   It's also really a show title.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.800]   No, it was.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:30.800]   It's already been.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:31.800]   Grippy Bottom.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.800]   Grippy Bottom.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800]   It already was.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:39.440]   So the other thing that used me as smart compose is coming from Gmail to Google Docs.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440]   Oh, Docs.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.440]   So I imagine--
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.440]   That's a good thing.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.680]   Yeah, the future teachers will be saying, did you write this paper or did Google?
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.680]   Oh, boy.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.160]   I don't know.
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   It's coming to Google.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:51.160]   What?
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.160]   Google Docs.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.160]   Docs.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.160]   Nice.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.160]   I think that was entertaining.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded--
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.480]   Oh, I didn't do the change log.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:02.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.560]   Well, let me look at it.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.560]   Was there anything--
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.440]   Google and ask, I'm going to do it really quickly.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.440]   Play the trumpets.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440]   Go Google.
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   Change.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.440]   [SIGH]
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.440]   Boy, this guy goes on vacation.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:15.440]   See you up.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.440]   All right, man.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:19.840]   And I'm the one who said I wanted things to change.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.600]   Google launches Google Earth tools that the users create and present virtual tours.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.520]   Google Search will now give you feedback on your pronunciation.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.760]   That's the last thing I want.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.760]   Google's putting an algorithmic audio news.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.760]   I'm just doing that.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.760]   No, you don't.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:33.760]   It's key.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760]   It's key.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.760]   It's key.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.760]   Everyone knows.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:37.760]   Yes.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.760]   It's key.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.200]   Google's putting an algorithmic audio news feed on its assistant.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.160]   What is that?
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.360]   I think little snippets of news for likes of NPR and stuff like that.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360]   Okay.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.320]   So how do I invoke it by asking for it?
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:51.320]   You say, give me my news, right?
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.320]   Give me my news.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.720]   They're combining classic hangouts and hangout chat settings for G Suite admins.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.160]   And Google Lens is now integrated into Chrome Image Search.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.360]   That was the world's fastest change.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.600]   Well, you know, to be honest, the only reason we put the change lock back in is because
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.960]   people were mad at us that we didn't have enough Google's in the Google this week in
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.960]   Google.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:18.160]   But this show was all about Google.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.160]   It was.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.160]   This was a--
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.160]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.160]   Stop.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.800]   With two minutes of Disney Plus.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.240]   Next week, though, we're going to rename the name this week in Light Song Jigsawx.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240]   Right.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.240]   Nice to be sure to--
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240]   Thank you.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.240]   That's going to be great for us.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:35.280]   My last ticket epistemology.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:37.240]   This week in nihilistic epistemology.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:39.720]   Now I like that.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.720]   Maybe.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.120]   That shows like a Google bomb.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.360]   I even brought this in the airplane.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:51.360]   700 pages.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360]   No, it's Gutenberg involved.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.360]   Well, after the fact.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.360]   It's the Scottish.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.360]   It's the Scottish Enlightenment.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:57.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:59.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.360]   There's a Scottish Enlightenment.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.360]   Oh, he was caught in the light.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:08.360]   Oh, we all went down and tossed the camera.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   And then we were in London.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]   The Scottish Enlightenment.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360]   We were in London.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.360]   I think you're making stuff up now, Jarvis.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.360]   No, no.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.360]   If it's not Scottish, it's crap.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.360]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.360]   For now, you--
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]   For now, you--
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:27.360]   What?
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.360]   What do you got for me?
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.360]   Harold, you know this is history of communication.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.360]   Ooh.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:32.360]   Hi, Matthew.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360]   Very Canadian.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360]   Harold, you're going to have a look.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]   Yeah, Harold's a great--
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   Like this, Marshall McClellan's spiritual successor.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   I'm going to visit my father next and saw it be boring sitting on the couch while he's
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.360]   on the couch.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.360]   So I could read these books.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   Perfect.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.360]   A lot of my father, but he might just do it.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.360]   Well, I'll say it, key 512.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.360]   I'll say it.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.360]   Apparently, there's a drinking game.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.360]   And whenever I say Scottish Enlightenment, you have a drink.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.360]   So congratulations.
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.360]   There you go.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.360]   You've been waiting a long time for this one.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360]   Let's all have a dram.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.360]   A wee dram.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.360]   A wee dram.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded this show thing.
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.360]   God.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.360]   It is something we do every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 12 Pacific, 130 Eastern,
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   21, 30 UTC, which I give you those times because that's the live recording which you can watch
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.360]   and in fact stream audio or video from twit.tv/live.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.360]   If you're doing that, go in the chat room because that is a great community of people.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.360]   But they're all watching live.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.360]   So you want to be part of that.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360]   It's irc.twit.tv.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:37.360]   If you're not watching live, then we've got the twit community for you, for people who
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:41.360]   want to asynchronously interact with our hosts, talk about the shows, talk amongst themselves,
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   www.twit.community.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:45.360]   It's a really nice forum.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.360]   Forums are back, baby.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:52.360]   On demand versions of this show are available at twit, our website, twit.tv.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.360]   That's for this show, twit.tv/twig, T-W-I-G.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.360]   Honestly, the best thing you could do for us and for yourself is subscribe.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.360]   Find your favorite podcast application.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:07.360]   It's Stitcher or Slacker or podcasts from Apple or Google or even YouTube.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   And if you subscribe, it sends them a signal you like the show, which helps us.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   And also make sure that you have the latest episode on your device, the minute it's available.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]   So subscribe for us, would you?
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360]   Thanks for being here.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.360]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360]   Bye-bye.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:32.360]   [MUSIC]
