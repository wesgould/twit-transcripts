[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   It's time for Twink this week in Google. Stacey Higginbotham is here. Jeff Jarvis is back from Davos.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:13.080]   We'll get a report from the World Economic Forum. We'll also talk. There's a lot of news about Amazon getting into the healthcare business.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.000]   Google adding a new local news feature for some of us.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.360]   And what about all those fake followers on Twitter?
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.980]   Do you think your reporter should be punished for buying followers? It's all coming up next on Twitch.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.980]   [Music]
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.860]   NetCasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.620]   This is Twink.

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.280]   This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans. Home plays a big role in your life.

[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show where you can cover the latest from the Google verse.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   Stacey Egan-Botham is here, of course, from Stacey on IOT. She's an expert in all kinds of things, but IOT is her current beat.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.280]   She does a podcast with Kevin Tofel there and a subscriber of free newsletters. Great. I read it every week.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   Hi Stacey.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.280]   Hello.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   Also with us, oh and be nice to Stacey because she's off caffeine this week.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280]   So I won't tell you about the newest espresso maker I got in the studio.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280]   She could get grumpy on us.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   Hey, speaking of grumps, he's back from Davos, ladies and gentlemen. Jeff Jarvis, the Rantar in Chief, Buzzmachine.com, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York in downtown Times Square. Great to have you, Jeff.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   How was Davos?
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   Davos was good. It's always a hoot. I'd say that what is Davos before you say how it was?
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   The World Economic Forum is an organization that brings together leaders in yes business, also government, also NGOs and academia, and about, I think, 2000 of them.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   What's the goal?
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:50.280]   The goal is world peace and prosperity and trying to just, it's very good at, seriously, it's good at convening people. They call it multilateral discussions, but they convene people across constituencies and you know you're in the room at the same time and you have a little white badge.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.280]   Oh, let's see is Davos badge. This makes you one of the mochers.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   This is even you have the weight badge. You're special.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   Oh, that means you're giving us a panel.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   This is the weight badge.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   It's so small.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   It is actually, you know what? This is the best badge on earth. It never flips around.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   I like it.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   Yeah, it's very simple.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   That's the...
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   It looks like one of those credit card size devices, you know, badges you use tap doors with to get in.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.280]   It's a... You tap all the time for security.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   Oh, that's why.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   Heavy security.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   Yeah, heavy security.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   Anyway, so you know, Facebook builds its own temporary building.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   Oh, geez.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   In Davos.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   Oh, geez.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   But that's why they have to, because they probably bring half the company out there.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   They bring it fair to people.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   Google doesn't do that, but Google has some sessions here and there and you have the...
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   All of the businesses in downtown Davos is not a high level resort.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   I mean, the fanciest hotel in town just about as the Hilton Garden Inn.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   Oh, God.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   A few better than that.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   But all the businesses basically leave and companies take over their spaces.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   Oh, that's cute.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   So you can be like this.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   It's a great coffee shop.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   No, no, you're not.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   They just empty everything out of it.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   And suddenly it is, you know, Swiss Rees' space or some such thing.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   Sounds like something I don't think Stacy and I would enjoy it all.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   No, it's exhausting.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   I would leave by 6 or 6.30 in the morning and get back at...
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   This time I didn't do any parties.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   And what do you go for?
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   I mean, besides the honor of being asked, what do you get from it?
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   I get to have meetings with a lot of people in one place.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   I mean, it's really useful for that.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   In this case, there were a lot with Facebook and Google, but also across journalism.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   I'm the member of the International Media Council.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   So we have sessions with media on our problems.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   And so it's good for me to be there as a professional bladder among them.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   It's worthwhile.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   It's reviled by some because...
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   Kind of like the bohemian Grove.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   It's, you know, 1% of the ones.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   It's the best.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   Yeah, so the funny thing was, normally there's lounges.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   There's the partner lounge.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   If you pay the full amount, you get this partner lounge and there's this food there.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   You can't believe I got to go one meeting in there and let me have a beer.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.280]   Then there was another lounge where I could go in.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   You can get a nice little glass of orange juice or a little tiny cheese sandwich, right?
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   This year, I wasn't allowed in.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   Oh.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   I'm not of the pulley.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   So I felt like I was the 99% of the world.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   You're too elite to get into the sandwich place?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   No, I was not only enough to get into the sandwich.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.280]   I'm the 99% of the 1%.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   The pulley or the people?
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   Point pulley.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   Point pulley is the people, not the fancy folk, just the people.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   I wasn't.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.280]   You were neither, you were neither nor.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   How many women were there this time?
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   Twenty-some percent.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   Not they goes up by bit, but not nearly enough.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   It is not a diverse crowd.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   The way it works is the companies pay a fortune.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   They pay 500,000 plus to go and the forum will require them to have women in their delegation,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   but they shouldn't have to require it.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   Number one, and it should be higher number than that.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   Number two.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   Wow.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   Well, I'm back.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   I fell.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   It was over freezing the whole day.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   They got a huge amount of snow and they don't really plow the streets there.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   They just kind of rough up the ice.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   So when I got there, the first time I got there, it was raining on top of ice and I'm a clumsy
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   guy.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   And I had my new ugs on.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   Yes, I bought ugs and I fell badly.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   It wasn't Crocs.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   It sounds like Davos is like a bad side of Switzerland.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   They rough up the ice there.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   What the?
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Wow.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   Okay.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   Well, that's it for my Davos report.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   That's the Davos report, Lee.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.280]   One interesting thing that was there of note.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   It always opens every year now in the last 18 years with the Edelman Trust Barometer.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.280]   And you probably saw some reports on this, but it's devastating news for institutions,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   media is the lowest trusted institution on earth now.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   One half of the people, the 33,000 surveyed around the world in 28 countries do not even
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   come to mainstream media at all.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   Not just in the US, but around the world.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   So it's really surprising.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   There was a fall in trust.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   They survey trust in government, business, NGOs and media.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   And I would add a fifth institution, which is people like me.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.280]   I don't mean like me.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   I mean people like us.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   And this professional.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   No, I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.280]   people like you or you or you or you, people who quote unquote like me.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.280]   And there's some rise in expertise.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.280]   I'd say I'm looking at it right now.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.840]   It does say the 2018 barometer has a five point rise for journalism, but but rise against
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.280]   platforms in that category.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   Media was still rock bottom.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.240]   It was bad news for media all around platforms was very bad.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.120]   And worse, so it's worse for Facebook than media, but in both cases, they're not doing
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   great.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   Yes.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120]   Yes.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   So that led to kind of the tone of the whole week.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   But then when Trump arrived, basically, you know, give him a tax tax cut and they'll
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   let you shoot somebody on the promenade.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.360]   You know, it's it was a love fest for the president.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.160]   Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   But yeah, in his talk, which I didn't I chose not to attend, he got booed once we did his
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.440]   fake news thing.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.960]   But yeah, the exact score there, I went to a.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.520]   Do you think that he and the whole fake news thing are to blame for the for falling trust
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   in journalism?
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.200]   It sounds like it's been that way for a while though.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.480]   We trust him to go down on journalism since the 70s.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.600]   But yeah, I think it's why I don't understand why.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.200]   I mean, more people should actually the folks news.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.280]   Oh, I think because like my dad's had less.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.520]   He's had less faith in the mainstream media because Fox reports things truthfully in a
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.640]   way that so I think it's kind of the partisanship of news, if that makes sense.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.760]   And I think yes, I think cable news in general has has lowered the esteem of news.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.880]   But gosh, that's so disappointing because I feel like that's bad because if you want
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   to be and I think, you know, we try to consider ourselves a trusted source for information.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.480]   If you're trying to be a trusted source for information, it's very disappointed that people
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   are not trusting you.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.280]   Where are you going to get your information from?
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.800]   If you don't trust.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.760]   They trust you and they want to, which is really distressing.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.720]   Like, you know, I have people who rely on me as an expert in things that I'm an expert
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   in.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.240]   And then in that same area, if I report on something and this is something as silly as
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.160]   like a radio protocol, if all of a sudden I'm like, yeah, you know, guys, I'm not that
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.960]   sold on Bluetooth mesh.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.640]   I've had people tell me that, well, that's inaccurate.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.680]   Your reporting's all wrong.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.480]   You're very biased, biased for Wi-Fi.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.040]   I mean, no.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.640]   So there's just the presumption that everybody's got an axe to grind.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   Yes.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.240]   And if you don't agree with, if they don't agree with you, you must be grinding your
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   axe.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240]   If that makes sense.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.800]   You recommended to me, Jeff Kurt Anderson's book, Fantasyland, which I'm in the middle
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   of.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   Did you not?
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   I don't know.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   I think it was somebody else.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   I'm running it.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Oh, it's quite good.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800]   It's basically about that.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.160]   But I think his premise is false.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.040]   I'm going to disagree with him because he says this fake, first of all, he says fake
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.840]   news is 400 years old.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   It's as old as America.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.080]   But in fact, even if you read his book, you would come to the conclusion, well, actually
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.360]   a long predates America.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.480]   Fake news is a human condition going back.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:54.080]   I mean, he talks about Protestantism being an important transition point, and especially
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   for Americans because of course we were born as a Puritan Protestant nation because it,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.280]   for the first time ever, said it's not the experts that tell you what to believe.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   You get to decide.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:12.800]   It's your faith that matters, not the pope, which okay, but honestly, people who believe
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:19.760]   the pope are not any less engaged in fantastical thinking.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.640]   So he kind of defeats his own premise in the very first pages by describing this transition
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:34.240]   as if it somehow people went from being hard thinkers to serious to fantasy people.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.640]   No, it goes back a long way.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   Or does.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.480]   But it's a very interesting thing.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.400]   I mean, in other words, the fake news thing is not new.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.520]   There's certainly a real partisanship in the United States that we've never seen before.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.680]   Well, look at that's pile of books.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.680]   Is it in there pile of books?
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.080]   Yeah, I'm researching again.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   Holy cow.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:59.960]   So I'm trying to figure out this notion of the death of the mass.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.640]   And so it leads you to think about how we saw information to society and I'm reading,
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.040]   doing and then all kinds of people on this.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   Now it is fascinating.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   I don't think there is a shock to make.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.640]   It's on bersons propaganda, right?
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   Isn't that exactly?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.880]   Well, that's that's Bernays's propaganda.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.120]   And then it's liberals, the crowd.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   He hates it.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.960]   So it's very much about elitism and the notion of the individual rising and know it all.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.040]   It all fits in of a piece.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.600]   But I do think that we're in a markedly different time now because of the net.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.960]   And that's what I.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.240]   Although as somebody in the chat from RF 2020 saying the polarization that's occurring
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.040]   in political journalism doesn't seem to be happening in tech journalism.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.960]   Jacey, you're an example notwithstanding.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.720]   I don't think except Apple fanboys versus the world.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.320]   Well, that's always been the case.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.080]   But I guess you're right.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.920]   You can be accused of being a.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   Okay.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920]   Never mind.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.800]   It's it's the way it is in the world.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   How about this?
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:09.040]   I thought one of the least underreported and I thought most interesting stories of the week.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:17.360]   Amazon is partnering with Berkshire Hathaway and Chase to create their own health care.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:26.240]   And I'm sorry, JP Morgan to create its own health care for says for its employees, right?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.480]   They're going to be three corporate behemoth.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.600]   This is the New York Times Amazon Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.240]   And announced on Tuesday, they'd form an independent health care company for their employees in
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   the US.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.840]   However, I have to think, I mean, put myself in Jeff Bezos's shoes that he's going to use
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:48.800]   his employees as a test tube for a product, which I shall call for one of a better name
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.160]   Amazon health.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.120]   Prime of your life.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   Prime of your life.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.160]   I like it.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.400]   We've just created the whole marketing campaign.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:05.840]   So, you got Amazon Prime and health care and internal life.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   You can pay forever.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   Sorry, Stacy.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   You guys get excited.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   I'm not too.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   I'm too.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   I'm too.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   I'm too.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   I'm too.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.840]   Uncaffeinated to get too excited right now.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   It's going to slow the stage.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   Stacy's beat today.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840]   Awesome.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:32.120]   In the sense, we are clearly hitting an intractable place with health care and pharma drugs.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.560]   And it actually reminded me of the story about four major US hospital systems creating
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   their own drug company.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.600]   I don't know if you guys saw that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.840]   So I looked at this as an extension of, oh my God, our health care system is so screwed
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   up.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.000]   And we solve this problem.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.480]   Even if it's just for ourselves, I'm sure it will go beyond that.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:08.320]   But I think what you're going to see is technologists and the arrogance of their ways, saying the whole government in general is failing us.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.520]   And we're going to replace government.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.000]   Well, you know, in some ways they kind of have.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.800]   Yeah, we're already way down that road.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.040]   And in fact, Stacy, the trust barometer thing says businesses are now more trusted than
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.920]   government in the world.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.280]   And Edelman was arguing the government should lead.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.880]   I had usually I'm the optimist here, right?
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.280]   My first reaction was optimism.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.120]   My second reaction was a slight.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.520]   Oh, this could be a mondo cost cutting thing.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.200]   And one of the health care isn't very good.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   You're stuck with it.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   That's the only option.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.840]   Well, I think there's a lot of things to think about.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.080]   So I've I mean tech companies have been wanting to get into healthcare since at least I remember
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.800]   being in the audience at like the world council on IT in 2004, 2005.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.600]   And I think it was Paul Oderlini, I think was the CEO then of Intel getting up there and
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   just.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.320]   Talking about telehealth and it was going to be amazing.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.640]   And you know, what are we?
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.880]   13 years later?
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   And we still telehealth programs exist, but they're still controversial.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.960]   They're still difficult to measure.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:18.560]   And even things like progress such as EHRs, electronic health records are a wretched mess
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.240]   because the software is proprietary.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:29.320]   You can't the epic, the companies that are part of this are hugely expensive.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.440]   There's so much waste in part because it's so highly regulated and these guys coming in
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.920]   are not going to change the fact that healthcare is still incredibly regulated.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:48.560]   So the question is, can they achieve efficiencies by going around not going around the regulation,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.440]   but working within those regulations?
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.040]   And heck, if they can, got more power to them.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.560]   I think what happened in in that era was a land grab because well, it maybe didn't start
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:06.840]   in 2004, but Obama early on said we're going to move health records electronic and there
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.760]   was a big opportunity there.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.640]   I think many companies until included said, ah, and Google, Google was going to go big
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.000]   and Google health Microsoft had Microsoft health.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.920]   But I think that was a response to a market opportunity, which was, oh, we've got all
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.720]   these, you know, health providers and they need to all because it was a mandate.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.000]   They need to all move to electronic records.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.920]   And yeah, it was a mess, but I don't think it was, I think this might be a little different.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:39.720]   I feel it goes in the pile of stories we have about Mark Zuckerberg running for president
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.440]   and Silicon Valley's arrogance.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.680]   I think it, I think, or Silicon Valley's ability to improve the world.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.720]   Well, they certainly feel that that's their ability, right?
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.800]   And I think that they're looking at government saying, all right, government's failing.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.400]   And I think healthcare, I mean, this is a lot of projection because it could just be
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.240]   Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan trying to cut healthcare costs by doing it themselves.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.520]   That's how Kaiser started, by the way, Kaiser, which is our big HMO on the West Coast was
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.440]   created by Kaiser aluminum as a healthcare system for its employees.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.720]   It went public later, which is the model for this, by the way, Kaiser.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.680]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.400]   I think this isn't a let's solve healthcare writ large.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.680]   I think this is let's solve healthcare for us and see what we can learn.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.440]   Because it's a cost and we know that Bezos is really interested in reducing costs.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.680]   Which is what gives me a little bit of concern about that.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.080]   But I think, yeah, I think it's too public and too Trumpeted if they wanted to just do
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.760]   it to cut costs, they might be different.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.000]   So I put in the rundown, I put in four stories this week and I had like a little more that
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.720]   were related to Google and health.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.200]   They're starting to bubble up again.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:50.680]   The most sobering, I think, was that Google AI predicting hospital deaths.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.600]   And at first I was like, oh, the death panel, I'm sorry, sir, but you're, you got a 95%
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.640]   of crank and so we're not doing crap for you.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.200]   But supposedly it's the opposite.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.560]   It's, oh, we can predict the deaths so we can forest all.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   Yeah, this is AI.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   This is Google applying AI to every possible thing from potato growing potatoes to killing
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   people in hospitals.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   You're going to see a lot of this.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.600]   I mean, this is the this is going to be the trend for the next many decades is how do
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.520]   you apply a big, big data and AI.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.880]   And where do you have a lot of data?
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.120]   Well, things like hospitals, hospitals, yeah.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   Right.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.440]   And, and you have the other important element to that is you have the results.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.920]   So you have all the incoming data and then you go and happen.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.720]   That's a big deal when you're working with data.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.840]   No, you know what Stacey?
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.440]   So I've had my two cancer surgeries and actually the hospital didn't find the results from me.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   They didn't really ask.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.160]   They don't know what works and what doesn't work.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   We got to fix that.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.680]   Whereas you're right in a hospital, you at least have the, you know, did someone die
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.400]   leave on foot or in box?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.960]   That's a data point you can you can actually draw.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960]   Yes.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.160]   Then so you have to combine government regulation like HIPAA particularly.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.720]   In fact, one of the things Amazon did that was a red flag was they hired a HIPAA expert.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.520]   So that's one.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:22.640]   But then there's, so there's that, but there's also FDA.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.480]   There's all, I mean, this is all very complicated.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.280]   And then there's the individual's concern for privacy.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.640]   A lot of people, well, I think one of the reasons Google Health failed was not because
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.760]   it wasn't a good idea, but because people were concerned about privacy.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.400]   Interestingly, Apple, who is going to say Apple is doing their health stuff.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.400]   Increasingly, positioning itself as the privacy company, right?
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   So maybe you trust them.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.600]   They just did an update where they were adding more something to their health.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.480]   Apple Health, the health app is going to be able to import your record.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   That's it.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480]   Which is great.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.480]   Looking that up.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.480]   Isn't that a great idea?
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   It is.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.160]   Because then instead of, so I'm on Kaiser.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.560]   So Kaiser has an app and I can look up my health record.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.240]   It's all, it is available to me on my phone, but for people who can't do that, having
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.440]   that in the, and actually I would like to have it in Apple Health because then I can
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.720]   cross reference it to other things Apple Health records.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.920]   So then there's also the story of somewhere.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.600]   Do people, the question on this Apple thing is do people, did Google's fail because it
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.800]   was Google and is Apple going to succeed because it's Apple and people trust Apple?
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.760]   I don't think that's not just trust.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   Here's the other thing that you should think about.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.680]   Health care is inordinately complicated.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Yes.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.040]   And Apple's notoriously bad at this stuff, by the way.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:50.960]   But it does think about the overarching user experience in a way that Google, my God,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.600]   never seems to actually do.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.360]   So I think that Apple, how many messaging platforms are there?
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   How do I call you Jeff?
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   Should I call you?
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.080]   But Apple can't help all right.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.120]   I mean, for all that Apple is terrible at network services.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   Terrible.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.640]   They are, their cloud is terrible, but that's actually probably good in this case.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.000]   If they can create an experience around your health data, and they're very clear to talk
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.320]   about it in reference and advertise a market about it to you.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.960]   It's not to your doctor.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.720]   They are doing the partnership with that now, but their advertising is all about giving
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   you this information.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   Right.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   Yes.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.520]   And people think of Apple as a privacy focused company instead of Google as an advertising
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.520]   focused company.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   I don't know.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.720]   That's a bug made into a feature.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   I don't know if it's true.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.440]   Apple failed at the ad business.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.600]   Thus can't use the data.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   Thus decided to turn that into a feature.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.760]   I don't know that Apple is so virtuous as this would make it seem.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.320]   My instinct isn't that is that they are not, but I don't have any evidence to prove otherwise.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.480]   So there's also I put up on the rundown.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.280]   Google's Verily started a project.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.840]   That's their life sciences alphabet.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.600]   Is this the naked mole rats?
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   No, this is not the naked mole rat.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.160]   I'm less than a naked mole rat.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Okay.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   So this is fascinating.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.600]   So this is they're going to get 10,000 people.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.520]   It's like that project that was done years ago of tracking people's health.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:18.560]   So they're going to do 10,000 people over five years from young adult to in the box.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:24.720]   And they have their own watch to where to track you across all of these areas.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.360]   It's kind of the Leo and I would sign up for.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.560]   No, he's going to not me.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   No.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.560]   No, even you would not sign up for this.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.880]   No, no.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.440]   Even I wouldn't trust this information to Google.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.520]   I wear an Apple watch, baby.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.160]   I trust this specific health project.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   Yeah, you are.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   It's not a dozen.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   I'll do it.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   Like the Framingham study.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.160]   It's a Framingham study.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   So yeah, the watch is not too much.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   It's a little fun.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   I understand.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160]   It is a lot of general study.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160]   But why Google?
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.320]   Why is Google doing this?
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   It's not really Google.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   It's very.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   You changed.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   You know, you would have jumped on this.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.760]   You would have said, well, I'm much more cynical about Facebook and Google than I used
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   to be.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.760]   And I'm not.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   I know.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.720]   I'm a little on the I'm a little on the fence on Apple.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.000]   But if I'm going to choose one, I would choose Apple over.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Look at Microsoft.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   This cracks me up.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.120]   Microsoft also did like Google Microsoft Health and is still alive unlike Google.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:19.600]   They haven't killed it except if you scroll down, they show the Windows phone app and
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.520]   the Microsoft Band app, both of which are dead products.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:31.400]   So now I'm thinking maybe Microsoft Health isn't a primary focus.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.040]   I don't even know why this website's still up.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.800]   They don't make this stuff anymore.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.480]   Well, so is the health fault still up?
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.080]   I was going to help fault my still.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   I think they have deal.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.640]   Don't they have deals with some hospitals in to put cancer data in the cloud.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:53.560]   I think that goes back to the land grab when electronic health records became the mandate.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.720]   And I think all of these initiatives do.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.760]   I think that's different from what Amazon's doing.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.240]   My gut is Amazon.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.120]   By the way, the press release said they're forming an independent company that is free
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.480]   from profit making incentives and constraints.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.080]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.520]   Not nonprofit.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.880]   Just free from profit making incentives and constraints.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.560]   Although that is part of the problem with the health.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.640]   They're free from profit.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.640]   Free from profit.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.640]   There's a distinction as Fortune points out between free from necessity to turn a profit
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.400]   and nonprofit.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.200]   I could absolutely see Amazon doing its own health thing starting.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.600]   How do you feel about your company knowing all your employer knowing everything?
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   No.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.600]   This is a separate company.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.840]   They're creating a separate company and your employer already pays for your health
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   care.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.680]   Yeah, but we don't know anything about our employees' health.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.480]   Remember, Tim, what's his name?
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   AOL dude.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.720]   Can't think of his last name right now.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   Who did on his earnings.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   Armstrong.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.760]   Or our earnings were hit in part from health expenses.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.240]   Remember, the baby, one of our employees had a sick baby and everyone was like, "Oh,
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   yeah."
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:17.280]   So they don't know details, but they can piece together some things if you're an outlier.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.800]   My experience, and I may not be universal, my experience is the insurer won't tell you
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.240]   why the rates went up.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.960]   You have to make that leap.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   Yes.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.000]   But your rates are going up all the time anyway.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.720]   It depends on whether you're self-insured.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.560]   No, I'm saying as an employer.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   As an employer.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.920]   No, even so, even so, I know that you're not buying, in one company I worked for you,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.000]   we weren't buying any insurance.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.640]   We were paying the direct costs through an insurer.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.960]   The insurer wasn't really an insurer.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.680]   The insurer was just an accountant.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.520]   Yeah, no, we don't do it that way.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.640]   We have health plans through blue shield and Kaiser and stuff that we have.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.120]   We will know that our rates have gone up, and you could say, "Well, it must be because
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.880]   he was sick, but I'm sorry, Tim, you don't know that that's the fact.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.920]   It might just be your rates went up."
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yeah, the rates are going for everybody.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Yeah, Tim Armstrong.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:18.040]   Okay, contrast that big business taking over government with the notion that government
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.360]   might take over the 5G network.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.880]   Okay, this is just such a stupid story.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.640]   I'm just going on the record.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.080]   The guy who, this isn't even a trial balloon.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.440]   I think this came out because somebody in national security was like, "Oh, this would
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440]   be a great idea."
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.760]   But it is a great idea.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.320]   It is a terrible idea.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.720]   Oh, it's a terrible, terrible idea.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.160]   So this was a PowerPoint presentation, not even a recent PowerPoint presentation, apparently,
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.560]   from national security officials who said, "You know, because of the threat of China
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:55.680]   spying on us, the US government should build the 5G networks, not let the telcos do it,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.000]   and then lease those lines to telcos so that we can make sure it's secure."
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.360]   So here's my tweet about that.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.880]   What's wrong with that?
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:09.280]   To protect America from China, America builds a Chinese internet.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   It's not a Chinese internet.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   Almost everybody.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.680]   That's what I'm talking to.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.880]   Here's, we had a great conversation about this before the story broke, oddly enough,
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   on Twitter on Sunday in which it was, I think, concluded that the correct solution to preserving
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.320]   net neutrality in the United States would be just like the interstate highway system for
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.240]   the government to build the infrastructure, whether it's local, state, or national.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   Probably it would have to be federal government, build the infrastructure, and then maintain
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:45.280]   it and probably even make a profit on it, leasing it to as many internet service providers
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.640]   as possible, providing true competition.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.240]   That's how many utilities run.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.480]   It's the way many utilities run.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.000]   It's the way the interstate highway system runs.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.160]   And it is the only way, because telcos are never, it's not in their interest to preserve
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.520]   net neutrality.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.480]   So that's the right way to do it.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.160]   Unfortunately, we're stuck with landlines being the few times of telcos, unless you're
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.040]   willing to do something politically very controversial, which is a certain eminent domain and say,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   "Well, you made enough money on those lines.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   We want them now."
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   I don't think this is--
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   This administration ain't gonna do it.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.600]   Well, any administration's not gonna do it.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   No, it's just the difference.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   The difference.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.240]   It happens in other countries, because they don't have any.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.480]   Yes, just let me set it up and then you'd knock it down.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   This is Bolin for Leo.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.520]   So it happens in other countries, because they don't have the same situation we do.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   It was built here and it was built piecemeal.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.200]   They had the chance to build it right.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.480]   It's too late to do it for landlines.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.720]   What about letting-- What about the government--
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.640]   I think you can make the argument 5G is ultimately gonna replace terrestrial internet.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.800]   If that's the case, what's wrong with having government build the 5G networks provided
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:58.600]   there are, of course, restrictions on what governments can do to watch the network and
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   so forth.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.280]   But the idea being, like the interstate highway system, they maintain it.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   Okay, now I'm not gonna--
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.240]   Wind up, wind up, the port pitches to Stacey.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.880]   Okay, the landlines, which I think you're just being wired like wireline broadband.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.280]   Wireline broadband, thank you.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.320]   Okay, so from that standpoint, ideally way back in the day, we would have done conduit
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.400]   and everyone could run their own networks through it.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.440]   That is the most fair, probably the most American way to do it unless you're gonna be a socialized
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.680]   country, which I don't think we're ready for.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.200]   With 5G and a wireless network, there's a couple things.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.080]   So are we talking about mobile 5G or fixed 5G?
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.840]   If we're talking about fixed, which is what we would look at for replacing wireline broadband,
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.520]   we would have to-- You have to figure out what layer you would give up control or how
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.760]   far up the government would build.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:55.960]   So in the case of 5G, a lot of that spectrum requires you to have line of sight or a close
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.120]   tower network, basically.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.440]   So you're gonna have to have fiber to it so you could say the government can control
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.960]   that but then they're gonna have to take that fiber.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.000]   Then you've got to say on people's rooftops, you're gonna have to have a satellite or some
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.560]   sort of distribution mechanism to cover an area.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.720]   And that becomes really questionable because if you're already like AT&T or Verizon, you
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.480]   already have those existing relationships in people's houses or on people's houses that
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.520]   you have access to, right?
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.760]   If the government comes in and wants to put a 5G satellite dish in your house to build
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.880]   this secure network, you're gonna be like, "What?
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.960]   Also are they gonna use imminent domain to put these towers up?"
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.240]   And then for wireless spectrum, already they're starting to share some things.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.920]   But he's happy on that.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.320]   Let's start on that one.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.520]   I don't know how making a private makes that any easier.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.720]   Government at least has rights of way.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.240]   If you're doing private industry, then they've got the same issue.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.360]   They've got to go and buy it from somebody's house.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.320]   So the government already owns...
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.920]   AT&T already has this stuff.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.320]   AT&T already has a satellite permit.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   They have a...
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   Oh, God.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   Is it digital?
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   Is it direct?
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.920]   There's two areas to argue.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.840]   And you're arguing on the technical issues.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.600]   There's also the argument that most people's reaction, which I think was both of your reaction
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.560]   is, "Oh my God, don't let the government run the internet."
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.160]   No, actually, no.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.480]   That is not actually...
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.680]   So let's be clear.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.320]   Running the internet is...
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.240]   The government could do this.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.680]   They would just have to set up rules in a way to do it that's normal.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.360]   The lack of testable expertise in this.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   Your stations are refi-bound.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.040]   Well, AT&T already gives your data over to the government if the government knocks on
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.680]   their door and gives them a rose.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.640]   So that's kind of a naive assumption.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.920]   The assumptions built into this presentation are just ludicrous.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   They don't explain anything.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.680]   And to attack it at a technical level is where it needs to be attacked.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   This isn't just technical.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.080]   This is also economic.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.360]   No, but we did this with the interstate highway system.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.880]   There was nothing.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.640]   Admittedly, there's no consensus for this.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.960]   In fact, all five FCC commissioners, Democrat and Republican have outright rejected this.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   So it's a non-starter.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.600]   However, I think it's a damn good idea.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.040]   And I think the technical issues can be solved.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   I would try to ask the English...
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.800]   It's the only way to get to network neutrality, frankly.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   That's not true.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.440]   Well, how are you going to get Sprint AT&T Verizon?
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   And Comcast...
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   We regulated.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.200]   That's how you're going to get.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.800]   We have given up the idea of a truly competitive broadband market.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   Well, that's the mistake.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.200]   We need to bring back competition.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   Yes.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Can I ask a question?
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   Okay.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   Well, oh, yes.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   Sorry, Jeff.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   It's a question.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   So one point of question.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.680]   So isn't it a hybrid in the UK, as I understand it, where basically the government paid BT to
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.920]   build the infrastructure, but then BT is required to enable anyone to use it?
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.280]   And I also think BT was originally a governmental.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.760]   Originally, but I don't think about the time the internet was built.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.720]   I don't think it was governmental anymore.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   That's true.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.720]   That is true, Jeff.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.560]   So is that a hybrid, Stacey, where you could...
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.080]   Yeah, in a lot of countries, Australia has a hybrid situation.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   They do.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.320]   But then Korea doesn't...
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.040]   Korea is all government-run.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040]   Many...
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.760]   I think Scandinavian countries, I think for the most part, the government runs the infrastructure.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.680]   On landlines, we actually used to have that sort of system where they could resell...
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.240]   Oh, like, not ONTs.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:38.680]   Resell T1s and other switches and stuff in AT&T and Verizon had to provide cabinet space.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.200]   And you put your equipment there and you can run it over their lines.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.880]   And I can't remember the name for that, that we had it in Texas.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.320]   And it was kind of a...
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:52.640]   It was a bit of a joke because AT&T would never go out and fix the gear for other people.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.240]   I can't remember what the model is called when it was...
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.800]   Anyway, however, I don't think...
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.560]   I don't think we should even be talking about it because it's a dumb idea.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560]   If we want to talk about...
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.560]   I'm serious.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   It is...
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.040]   Let's talk about naked mole rats.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.320]   I don't think it's a dumb idea.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.800]   I think it's a political non-starter because both the left and the right hated.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   I think it's a political...
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   There's a unanimous...
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   It's a technical non-starter to build...
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.360]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.720]   I don't think that's true.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:27.600]   So right now to get fiber to all the places where we would need it to deliver this service,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.320]   the government, if they really wanted their own 5G network, they would have to build that
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   fiber out.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.600]   So that's one and that's a multi-billion dollar thing.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.200]   Who's going to do that if not the government?
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.240]   Okay Verizon and AT&T already have fiber out to these places.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.000]   There's no incentive for them to increase bandwidth.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   To do 5G?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.160]   There's no incentive for them to increase bandwidth.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   That is not true at all.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   So mobile 5G...
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:56.840]   Sorry, fixed 5G, which they both AT&T or Verizon are deploying, is more economical to them
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.840]   than fiber.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:03.240]   So they are putting that out because it is cheaper to do fiber to a certain point to
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.040]   back all those wireless networks.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   They're also investing in...
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.720]   But one of the reasons we have so much dark fiber in this country, you acknowledge we
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   have.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.720]   It's because they're not seeing it.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   And you know why they don't use it?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.560]   Because they would prefer a scarcity.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:22.600]   I'm telling you that the real problem in this country is that the people who run the telecommunications
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.720]   infrastructure have no incentive to provide us with good internet.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   That's true.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.640]   But that's something that can be, again, regulated.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.840]   And it's also something that they're forced to do when innovations come along.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:41.000]   So remember when AT&T brought in the iPhone and everybody's network sucked for like forever
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.400]   and then they fixed it?
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.080]   They just Apple pushed them to do that.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.160]   They're pushing them to do that when we're putting cars on the road.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.600]   And I know they have the absolute wrong mindset.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.520]   I've written this story a million times.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.520]   I look at the carriers and I just want to bang my head against the wall.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:04.200]   Like you could make so much more money if you invested in this network and had people
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.120]   become addicted to your product.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.640]   Instead, you're making it scarce and it's annoying.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.000]   None of that's happening.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.640]   So I would submit that we have evidence that they...
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.080]   There's not much more capacity.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   But they vary tightly controlling that capacity to keep it from.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   They are.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   They don't want as much capacity.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.920]   But the government doesn't have to come in and do this.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.320]   Other companies could come and do this.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.360]   There are definitely people who are looking.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.800]   And when I talk to like, especially in smaller areas, not necessarily in urban areas, but
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.240]   in rural areas in suburban, sub-rural, I don't know.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.080]   Exurban areas.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:47.200]   Where the local landline and broadband providers are concerned about upstarts coming in and
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.160]   doing 5G.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.080]   So that's going to happen.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.880]   Although not in Boston because Google just pulled out.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   So...
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   And Verizon stopped rolling out Fios.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.200]   I mean, all of the evidence is contrary to that.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.760]   Verizon is adding fiber in neighborhoods where it's planning to do 5G.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   5G.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   Yes.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   In their interest.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.960]   But that's going to be your broadband service.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   I don't understand.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.240]   That's why you need it to be done in society's interest, not in corporate interest, because
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.880]   they will not do what you think they're going to do.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.960]   They're going to tightly control it so that they can make it scarce because that makes
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.960]   more money.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   They're going to make more money on it that way.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.260]   Susan Crawford insists the wireless will never replace wireline that the demand is going
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.320]   to keep going up at a pace such that we'll need fiber.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.800]   That's also a possibility.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   I wouldn't be surprised for that.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   That's Shannon's law right there.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   You could only pray on so many bits perhertz.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   Right.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.480]   That may well be true.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   Okay.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.400]   I mean, it's kind of an academic argument because there's no way in hell.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   This is going to happen.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.840]   Although you can make, I think, some very good arguments that it should.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.720]   The security argument was the one put forward by this old PowerPoint presentation.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:04.240]   But there are, I think, good arguments in the public wheel that also support it, but
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   it's a non-starter.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.480]   So the public wheel.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   That's fancy.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   I know.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   That's nice.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   No one knows what it means.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.200]   I like saying things no one knows what they mean.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.520]   Except Jeff, because he's a professor.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.160]   Did you see Patrick Delahandy, our engineer, tweeted this out?
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.440]   I'm not sure, but I think Google's introducing a new search console based on the dozens of
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   emails I've received and Patrick just so you know, I got them all too.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.840]   Introducing the new search console.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.000]   This is for companies with websites.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Oh.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.200]   So I don't know what it means.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.760]   I kind of know what it means.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.960]   The search console is how you as a company with a website can control what Google see,
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.160]   you know, can let Google know, hey, here's the site map, here's, you know, and all that
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   stuff.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.920]   It's a way for you to make your website work better.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   But Google really wants everybody to know about it.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.800]   I'm just changing the subject because there's nothing more to say.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   There's not going to happen.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   So.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   Naked mole routes.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.640]   What's the deal with naked?
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.800]   What's the deal with naked mole rats?
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.880]   They can roll mats and Google could not make a roll mats.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.720]   That's something else.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.840]   Oh, ball rats, naked ball rats.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   Naked mole rats.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.920]   Google could make your life longer.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:29.400]   So we know that naked mole rats are a wonderful thing to study the heterocephalus globber as
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.360]   it's known or the sand puppy.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.440]   Oh, very good wheel and that in the same five minutes.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:43.080]   It is a naked, sightless, disgusting animal.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.320]   But for some reason, scientists keep wanting to study it.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   Is it their social organization?
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.680]   No, no, no, no, in this case.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   They don't feel clean.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.040]   Well, they don't actually live a long time because they just don't turn a life, but they
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.680]   have like a little cap to protect their DNA.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.720]   Oh, a DNA cap.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.600]   DNA condom.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.240]   So they also, as you said, lack pain.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.640]   They don't have pain.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.240]   They have very low metabolic and respiratory rates.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.200]   You too could live like a naked mole rat.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.800]   I'm not sure if I'd want to live longer.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.040]   Their legs are thin and short.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.360]   They can move backward as fast as they can move forward.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.200]   Their large protruding teeth are used to dig and their lips are sealed just behind the
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.920]   teeth so that their mouth doesn't get full of dirt.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.920]   How do they eat?
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   I don't know.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   I don't care.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.560]   I really don't.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:42.080]   So they can actually live an air that is only 5% oxygen for 5 hours.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.600]   And they can hold their breath for 18 minutes.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.840]   They can roll that through roll nets.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.440]   They can roll rats on Mars.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.240]   They can Mars rats.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.880]   They have a high resistance to tumors.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.720]   Basically, it's the cap of their telomeres that we're excited about.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:03.840]   And we like their...because we know that longer telomeres are good for longevity.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.480]   Now let's not get too excited.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.960]   They live as long as 32 years.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.320]   Dude, there's a queen mole rat.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.240]   And they're guarded by worker rats.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   I love this.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   This you would love.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.600]   I'll be your worker rat.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.360]   There's the queen of the mole rat.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.760]   Stacey, you are our queen mole rat.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.760]   Your queen mole rat.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   It is what they call...
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   All hell.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.280]   Stacey, the queen mole rat.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   It's the first mammal.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.960]   See their ants and bees and stuff exhibit this eusociality.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.880]   But it's the first mammal that they've ever found that does that.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.720]   The queen and one to three males reproduce while the rest of the members of the colony
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.560]   just work.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.880]   No sex for you.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   Work.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   Dig.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   Dig.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   Dig.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   Dig.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   Workers are sterile.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.720]   What is it?
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   Telomeres?
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   They got a telomere?
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   Telomeres?
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   Telomeres?
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   All good.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   They've got a cap.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:05.040]   So basically the idea is that protects their DNA from mutations and all kinds of other
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   fun stuff.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   So they're going to...
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   They're basically...
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.560]   Verily's like, "Hey, look, these animals which are creepy weird have this cool feature,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.640]   so we're going to research that further."
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   And that's the story.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.160]   And the fact that Google does it just makes it more fun.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.200]   We learned a lot about naked mole rats.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.880]   And I feel that that is always a worthwhile endeavor.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:29.560]   I take a supplement, a highly overpriced supplement to it lengthen my telomeres.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.360]   Truly, really?
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.600]   I don't know.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.840]   I fell for this and I don't know.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.840]   Was it a crowdfunding thing?
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.920]   No, you probably.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.280]   It's called Elysium.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   And...
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   Oh, yeah, I almost...
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   Yeah, from basis, right?
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   Yeah, that's...
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   It's actually...
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   It arrived.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   It arrived.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280]   No, I don't know.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.440]   The FDA has not approved this.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   And it's...
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440]   You want to increase your...
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.800]   Increase your NAD plus.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   My NADs are...
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   Plus...
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   No, just stop.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   Right there.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   Stop.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   Stop.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   I'm pulling a punch.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   NAD?
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   No.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   No.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.640]   NAD is vital to how sales use energy, a key player metabolism.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   That's why I...
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.680]   I feel so good.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.720]   I spend $60 a month to take a supplement.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.680]   Nobody even knows what it does.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   All right.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   All right.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.120]   Google Chrome lets you permanently mute annoying websites again.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.120]   Don't...
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   Don't...
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.120]   Don't...
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   I'll be quiet.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.120]   You don't have to...
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   Don't mute us.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   No, please no.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Not you.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   Don't worry.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   Wait, what is new about this?
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120]   I was confused by this.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   I'll be honest.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   Well, they had it.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   I remember there was...
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.920]   They had it, but I think they took it out and now it's there.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.240]   This replaces the previous mute tab feature that was only temporary.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.800]   So, you right-click the offending tab and mute the entire site, not just once, but forever.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.320]   So, believe me, I'll be doing that.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.400]   Google's also adding HDR support to Chrome 64 for Windows users.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:12.040]   If you have the Fall Creators update and HDR compatible monitor and graphics card.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:18.120]   Also, this version of Chrome is patched to protect Windows and Mac users against Meltdown
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.400]   and Spectre.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.360]   So, update your Chrome and I'm using Edge now because Chrome doesn't work on my Windows
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.360]   machine very well.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.640]   HTC deals done.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   The deal's done.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   Deal's done.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   Yeah, this is bad news for Qualcomm, man.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   I'd look at that.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   Really?
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   Qualcomm?
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   That's interesting.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.120]   So, they're going to not use Qualcomm chips anymore?
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   Well, no.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   So, their goal is to...
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:49.080]   The speculated goal, or maybe the stated goal, is to create an SOC for mobile phones.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:53.640]   And currently, in all of my mobile phones that run Android, I have Qualcomm.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.240]   Although, Apple's famously using a much worse Intel chip.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   Apple though is working very hard.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.720]   When Apple built their own process.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.240]   Yeah, to replace their own.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:07.040]   And it's not yet in the phones, but it will be any day now, probably in the next generation
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.040]   phones.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.720]   But they had a split half Qualcomm, half Intel.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.320]   In fact, Qualcomm sued them.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   Oh, for the baseband.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   For the baseband.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   And Qualcomm...
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.960]   Remember, Qualcomm sued them because they slowed down the Qualcomms because they were
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.440]   so much faster than the Intels.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.120]   So they just Apple just slowed them down.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.560]   So the HTC did not sell to Google.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:35.000]   They just, for $1.1 billion, gave them 2,000 employees, which is about half of their R&D
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   group.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.080]   And about a fifth of its 10,000 employees.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.520]   But HTC says, "That doesn't mean we're not making smartphones.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.400]   I'm just going to make it with half as many people."
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.880]   I find that deal so weird.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   So weird.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.880]   It's very weird.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.880]   And how has the division done?
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:56.520]   Did they just say, "Okay, everybody with last name, again, A to Z. You go with Rick
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   Osterlo."
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.280]   You get free lunch.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   You get free lunch.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   You don't.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   You get free lunch.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   You don't.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.760]   Maybe it's the firmware people.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   If Google's doing their own chips, maybe it's people who...
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   It must be divisions, right?
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.920]   Apparently, these 2,000 HTC employees are the ones that made up the Pixel team inside
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   of HTC.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.880]   Oh, well, then that's easy.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.200]   You worked on the Pixel.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.920]   So you're going to come with us.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.280]   Yeah, I was there one day.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   I was in a meeting.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   Can I come too?
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.240]   HTC made the Pixel 2.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.800]   LG made the Pixel 2 XL.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.480]   Oh, I had the Pixel.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.080]   No, it was a Pixel 2.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   It was a Pixel 2.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   Yeah, the Pixel 2.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.080]   And maybe even the original Pixel.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   It's a big one.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   The original Pixel.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   I had the original...
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.480]   No, the original Nexus?
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.480]   No.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   Yeah, yes.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   HTC made the original Nexus too.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.360]   In fact, HTC made the very first Android phone, which was that one with the slide out keyboard.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.920]   I have that.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   I have that somewhere in my phone.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   Of course you do.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   Museum of...
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   Speaking of which, speaking of which...
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   Oh, it's just a place.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   ...and the effort to always cost you more money.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.480]   Did you order a Google clip?
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.480]   I can't.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   Now, I saw the story that said...
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   You were slow.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.720]   It's for sale now.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:16.440]   And so I immediately went to store.google.com trying to buy a Google clip.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.600]   It's under accessories.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.640]   This is the really silly device that...
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.480]   I can save you for yourself.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.120]   It saved me for myself that you...
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   Oh, it's not here.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.120]   Where is it?
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.120]   Wow, it's all the way over.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   Where's the clip?
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.360]   They know nobody wants it.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.920]   Maybe it's not accessories.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.360]   Maybe it's in home and entertainment.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   Maybe nobody wants it.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   Maybe that's the problem.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   They had 10.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   They sold that out.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.480]   They didn't have very many because when I went there, it said the only option I had was
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   to cancel my reservation.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.040]   Oh, here it is, the Google clip.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.640]   So, see, leave waitlist is all I have up here.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.320]   Did I not get there soon enough?
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.680]   Maybe they just didn't want to give you one.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.760]   I can't imagine that.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   I think...
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   Do you like that interested enough?
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:06.840]   I think somebody at Android Central or whoever, 9 to 5 Google, got this invitation.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.360]   But it wasn't universal, it would be my guess.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.360]   Anyway...
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.480]   Speaking of invitations, guess what I got?
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   What?
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.680]   I invite to customize my Tesla from delivery in four weeks.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   Your Model 3?
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   Wow.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   That's...
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   Another thing that was kind of...
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   Before the end of January.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.480]   It just kind of happened and I was told by a number of people just log into your Tesla
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   to see Tesla count.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.160]   They called me.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   You got calls.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.400]   They also got your order of three also, Leo?
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.440]   I put the deposit down, but my reservation number is in the high 100 millions.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   So...
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   I'm...
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   I'm sure...
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   No, it really is.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.960]   Can I count your options, Stacy?
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   Can I show you what you get to customize?
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   Let's do it.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.720]   I'm going to sign in and see here real quickly.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.480]   Okay, yeah, let me go and sign in to my Tesla so I can tell you accurately.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.640]   Because I don't get that option.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   I'm jealous.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   Let's make some choices.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   So you're...
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   What did they say?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   When did you make your reservation?
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   Pretty.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   Pretty...
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   The day of.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.960]   Yeah, see, I did do mine too much later.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   So...
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.360]   Oh, you got priorities resulting?
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.360]   Right.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:16.200]   And they told us it was going to be reservation holder.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.520]   So that means you could get when?
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.000]   When could you get your Tesla?
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Four weeks for now.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   If I ordered it yesterday.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   What?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Would you?
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Are you?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.840]   I don't know.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.680]   You know, my challenge here is...
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.520]   Oh, God, what if I ordered the Tesla?
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520]   No, I didn't.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.880]   I was like, "Oh, my God, it's not showing me options."
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.480]   Honey, it's coming.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:45.680]   Yeah, my reservation number is 109,091,575.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   Are you serious?
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   Okay.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.120]   Well, so here are my options.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   I only get the option.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.120]   I only get the option.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.680]   Of the long range battery, but we knew that.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.920]   And then the premium upgrades also come.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.400]   So you don't get a choice here.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   Yes, see, that's why I'm...
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   It's first.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.400]   Exactly.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.840]   Maybe soon will be the base 35K model standard or dual motor all-wheel drive.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.240]   Yeah, see, I want dual motor and I want a bigger battery.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.240]   Okay.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.240]   So you're not...
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.720]   Sorry, I don't mind waiting.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:24.520]   But when I put my money down, my $1,000 down, it said 12 to 18 months.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.160]   But I don't want to be the first on my block down in Model 3.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.160]   And I would suggest you don't either.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.560]   I probably don't.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.240]   So my options are colors.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   So it's still...
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.200]   They add price, you know, black.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   I think black is included in.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.840]   You could use my referral link and you could get a unlimited supercharging.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.360]   Oh, no, that's where the new model lasts.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.360]   Never mind.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360]   I feel like I have unlimited.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.680]   Okay, so any color except black is going to cost you a thousand bucks more.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   What?
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   Black's okay then.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   Get black.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   Oh, no, I want the blue.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.600]   So it's amazing how he makes money, isn't it?
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:02.280]   And then wheels, you can have the 19-inch sports wheels that will cost you an extra.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   No, don't take it.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   1500.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.280]   You don't want that.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.280]   Let's see.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:12.720]   Really, this is Elon's upsell is all about putting a little more money in the till for
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   the future.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.360]   Yeah, that's why he's selling flamethrowers.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   Yeah, they upsell.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.840]   Yeah, why is he selling flamethrowers?
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   That's crazy.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.800]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.400]   California politician is outraged.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.040]   Outraged, I say, at Elon Musk's terribly insensitive flamethrower.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.880]   I thought it was the Elon Musk joke.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.520]   You don't really want an insensitive flamethrower.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.720]   So it isn't a joke and he sold quite a few.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.120]   But it's legal apparently because it only shoots a flame 10 feet.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.920]   If it's 10 feet or less, it's three feet.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.920]   That's a...
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   Well, that's the point.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.240]   If it's 10 feet or less, that seems plenty.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.560]   It's really a blowtorch, not a flamethrower.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.720]   Flamethrowers are really hot, by the way.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.920]   You can go to ranches in Texas and play with them because that's what people in Texas
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   do.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.960]   You can also drive tanks and shoot things.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:12.080]   But if you actually play with a flamethrower, it is an uncomfortable experience and I don't
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   recommend it.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:20.680]   TechCrunch says he's sold 15,000 flamethrowers in the first few days, netting $7.5 million
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.840]   for the boring Silicon Valley hubris.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.520]   I think that people are buying it.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.920]   I don't feel bad for him for that.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.040]   I mean, he sold all those hats for like what, a million bucks or 600?
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.040]   I mean, sure, whatever.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   But that's the same thing.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.520]   This could do damage.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.720]   Having a blue model three, it's just a way of...
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   I don't know.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   That's what the politician says.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.240]   Pre-order, let's see.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   Check out.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   That's it.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.240]   There's not much choice on there.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   It comes...
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   And there you go.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   Give us a credit card.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   That's it.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   500 bucks.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   I'm not ordering one.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.240]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.240]   It seems like a very...
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.600]   We have found your limit.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   No, I'm not.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   This is it.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.400]   Guaranteed to liven up any party.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.160]   World's safest flamethrower.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.840]   Fire extinguishers sold separately for exorbitant amounts of money.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.920]   This is on the boring companies page.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.840]   Taxes and shipping will be added to check out.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.280]   Additional customs fee may apply for international orders because of laws.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.960]   International customers could receive a full refund if not happy with said fees.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.920]   Before shipping, aspiring flamethrower aficionados will be sent to terms and conditions
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.520]   rhyme for review and acceptance.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.520]   Starts shipping in spring.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.800]   Maybe not be used on boring company decorative lacquered.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.240]   Hey, bae bales are boring company doxide munition warehouses.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.240]   Silly.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.400]   Yeah, it's just fun.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.840]   They do offer a $30 fire extinguisher.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.240]   Oh my God.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.240]   It's so funny.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.120]   Yeah, they also offer a hat.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.120]   You know, it's a...
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.760]   Yeah, a lot of people bought the hat.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:59.080]   I think really if you think that this is all a simulation, it really kind of raises the
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.760]   bar on things you can do.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   Like what's it matter?
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.800]   It's just a game.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:11.040]   You know, people have made that argument about religion.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.880]   Why keep this earth nice if you die and go to heaven?
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.880]   Right.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.400]   It's we atheists who are preserving the environment.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.760]   Want you to know.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   Good.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   Thank if you...
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   Hugging atheist today.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   Hugging atheist.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   Thank an atheist.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   If that river is running clean next to you, thank an atheist.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.400]   No idea.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:36.320]   Let's see.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.320]   Did you...
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   I was very moved.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.320]   Did you watch the Grammys on Sunday?
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   I did not.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.760]   I did not, but I think what you're about to show was moving.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:50.320]   So they did a very long song.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.200]   Who was that that was singing that song?
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   Oh, it doesn't say so there is.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   Well, there's an ad.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:01.960]   No, but in the Grammy Award ceremony itself, they had a song.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.920]   Oh.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.400]   Which was very...
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.880]   It was interesting because it was...
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.400]   Oh, I wish I could find that clip.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.960]   Let me see if I could find it.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.960]   It's probably illegal.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.880]   It was a hint and we can help you.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.600]   Logic is the name of the song.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   Logic.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   That was it.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.920]   It was the 8255.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.120]   Which is the suicide hotline number.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   Right.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   And it's old.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   During the...
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.120]   Let me play a little bit of it.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.320]   I probably only a small amount to avoid copyright.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   Oh, look.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   Google's now working.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.880]   I can't play any video.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.640]   So it was really kind of beautiful.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:45.240]   Logic who closed out his performance with a plea to call of unity.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.480]   Be not scared to use your voice, especially in instances like those
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:52.720]   when you have an opportunity.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.400]   Stand and fight for those who are not weak and you have yet discovered the strength that
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.320]   the evil of this world has done its best to conceal.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.600]   So here he is.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.600]   And what's interesting is...
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   We have an ad.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   Sorry.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.480]   Everybody's got to monetize.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.320]   There we go.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.960]   Is that it?
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:12.960]   No.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.960]   That's the...
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   That's the wafer ad.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Like that is the ad.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.640]   Do logic.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.120]   I don't want to die.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   In any event, I was watching this and I liked the song and I could tell that they were...
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.360]   You know, something was going on because they kept showing this number, which is in the
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   title of the song.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.000]   Here you go.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.960]   This is his acceptance.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.960]   Nice.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:36.960]   Puff.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.640]   You know, these guys show me the game today.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   Liggs from Close.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   No, this is Ken...
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   Ken from Omar, is it?
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   Edrick Lamar.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   Show me the hip.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   Thank you for nothing.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.240]   Thanks for nothing Time magazine.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.360]   Anyway, here's logic on...
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.320]   Here's a still of logic.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.760]   And so they all were wearing sweatshirts with a number.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.920]   It said, "Don't be silent.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.080]   You are not alone."
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.120]   It was really moving.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:09.360]   And then the Google ad right after the song ended, they go to end the commercial and
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   then the Google ad.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.160]   That's product placement to a good end.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.920]   It was really beautiful.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   Unfortunately, yeah, I will.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:25.560]   Unfortunately, logic's comments had to be bleeped by CBS.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:30.480]   Black is beautiful, hate is ugly, women are as precious as they are stronger than any
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.480]   man I've ever read.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.840]   And unto them I say, "Tall and crush all predators under the weight of your heart that is full
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.160]   of the love that will never take away from you to all the beautiful countries filled with
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:44.880]   culture, diversity in thousands of years of history, you are not bleepholes."
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.360]   It was really beautiful.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:53.320]   So let me find the Google ad because then it made sense.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:59.920]   I didn't know it made sense because I didn't really understand...
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   I couldn't...
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.160]   I made a video on the right.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:09.680]   I kind of understood the idea that this was something that was a reason for that phone
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.280]   number, but Google made it clear with the ad earlobe.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:17.680]   We'll do the really beautiful ad I thought, which I can't...
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.440]   You're just a mess.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.280]   This blocker is working too dang well.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   Here we go.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   Here we go.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.280]   There's a donut.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.680]   This must be another ad.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.680]   An ad on the ad.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.680]   There were donuts in the ad.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   There were donuts in the ad?
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.680]   Okay.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.680]   Sweet tooth firmware.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   There we go.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.680]   There we go.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.560]   The following of real people captured with the Google Pixel 2.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   This is nanny.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:44.800]   So initially I see this, I think, "Oh, this is an ad for the Google phone, the Pixel
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.800]   2."
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   The Sophia, the light of his life.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   And the beautiful pictures.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   This is Lauren.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:55.040]   And this is her new place, which will soon be crayon with all her friends.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.360]   This is Steven.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.320]   This is where he schools his military buddies.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   This is April.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   There are donuts.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320]   She got her sweet tooth from her dad.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.920]   This is Frank Hose.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.320]   And this is Dee.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.520]   This is her dream job.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.600]   Oh, wait.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.120]   This is Cassie.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.600]   These are her backup dancers.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.840]   So, this really is Mike.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.600]   This is his weekly barbecue club.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.640]   This is Alex with all the friends that will like her post from Friday night.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:26.480]   And this is the lifeline all these people bravely called to find hope.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.000]   So these are all people called to suicide hot one.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.560]   Not every picture tells us to be.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.920]   I mean, question your lens.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.160]   Suicide prevention lifeline.org.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.560]   That was really, so it came right after the logic performance.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.760]   And it was really amazing.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.520]   I mean, really, that was the highlight of the Grammys as far as I was concerned.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.560]   So that song has been like in the top 10 for a while.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.560]   It's a huge hit.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   I knew that's why I was puzzled because I knew this song.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.760]   And I said, what's with all the phone numbers?
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   And it's part of the title of the song.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   I'm not calling it.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.760]   Isn't that great?
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   Really?
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760]   Well, we're on such plugs.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   I want to just mention.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.880]   So when I was in Munich before Davos, I got to spend running into the hall on conversations
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   with Rose McGowan, who of course fueled the Me Too movement.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.880]   Yes.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:22.680]   And Tuesday night, she had a new special out on E and her book Brave is out.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.000]   And I just wanted to plug both those things because I think she's doing amazing work about
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.720]   as she calls him the monster.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.520]   Yeah, very good.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.040]   Let's see.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.480]   Let me do a break and then we can do more stuff.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.160]   You guys can pick your interests, the stories.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.480]   We've been jumping all over the place.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:56.440]   But I thought that was that's a good place to take a break because that was a nice moment.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.120]   And then we can talk about YouTube having malware and its ads.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.160]   We can bring it back to the real world.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.960]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.440]   One of the best lenders in the country is now making themselves their kissing up to us
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   geeks.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.520]   They're making themselves even more popular with Rocket Mortgage.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.360]   So Quick and Loans, the number one in customer satisfaction for eight years running according
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.720]   to JD Power.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.880]   Eight consecutive years from 2010 through last year, they'll get it again this year.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.080]   Four consecutive years from Mortgage Servicing too.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080]   They're really a great company.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.640]   Revitalizing to try to end Gilbert and his team are just great.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.840]   And I think they understood that the loan approval process was kind of out of date.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.560]   They had to go into a bank and go into the attic and getting paperwork and faxing stuff
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560]   in.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560]   I mean, come on.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.960]   So they realized it needed a technological revolution.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.320]   That's why they created Rocket Mortgage.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.120]   Rocket Mortgage is so cool.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   First of all, no more going to the bank nor going to the attic.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.680]   You could do everything on your computer or your laptop, on your tablet or even on your
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   phone.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   You just go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.960]   Answer a few questions.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.080]   You won't even have to look up the answers to you like your name, address, social security
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.080]   and the date of birth.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.580]   And then because they have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions you do
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:22.840]   business with with your permission, they pull all that information, crunch the numbers
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.760]   and based on your income, your assets and your credit, they say, here's the loans you
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.040]   qualify for.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.840]   Very transparently, this is what you qualify for.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.560]   You pick the rate, the down payment, the term, you pick what you want.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.200]   If you don't see anything you like, fine, no problem.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.960]   But if you see something you like, you say, okay, and they say approved.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.440]   And all of that happened in a couple of minutes.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.480]   A couple of minutes, whether you're buying a new home or refinancing, this is the simplest
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.080]   fastest, easiest way to do it.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.360]   Even if you're not about to do that any minute now or you're not at an open house at this
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.040]   very moment, go to rocketmortgage.com/twig and just set up the account so you'll be ready
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   to go.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.200]   Then it's even faster.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.920]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans apply simply.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.280]   You'll understand fully and you'll mortgage confidently.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:11.440]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig equal housing, lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.640]   access.org number 30, 30.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.520]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.960]   Great way to apply for a home loan.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.000]   We talked a little bit about this on security now.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.360]   This is ridiculous.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.760]   This is part of the problem in general with automated ad sales.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.600]   Even YouTube now has had some ads.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.280]   They say they're pulling them down that have cryptocurrency miners built into the ad.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   Jesus.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:46.040]   All that brilliance to go to that ad end.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.560]   People took to social media sites as of Tuesday to complain their antivirus programs were
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.360]   detecting this code when they visited YouTube.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.560]   Avast blocks crypto miners, others do.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:04.200]   So do many anti-ad blocking sites like UBlock Origin and so forth.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:11.680]   The ads on Trend Micro drive a three-fold spike in web miner detections.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:17.520]   They came from Google's DoubleClick ad platform and they were being displayed to YouTube visitors
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.080]   in Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy and Spain.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.560]   This is a known thing that goes on.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.200]   JavaScript that mines Monero.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:34.840]   The reason it works is because you're not devoting a huge amount of power to it, but
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.400]   if they have millions of people doing it, there's a chance they're going to make some
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.640]   money in cryptocurrency.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.680]   It's like SETI for your cryptocurrency.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   You don't get the money.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   It's a big thing.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   Unwinning SETI.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:53.880]   Why isn't there a service that lets me in fact donate or not donate, but rent my capacity
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.880]   and earn some of this?
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.880]   Well, there is.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.320]   CoinHive was the one that came up with this.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.120]   This was originally thought to be a system for monetizing websites.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.240]   It would have to be done with full disclosure.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:13.320]   You see now when I try to go to CoinHive, I'm my UBlock Origin, which is my ad blocker
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.600]   says this site is not secure, do not go there, and that's what you want.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.200]   I would get the same thing if I were to see these ads.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.560]   But I think the original way CoinHive positioned themselves was, "I don't know.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.880]   This is about monetizing websites legitimately."
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   It's not.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.760]   In fact, we're starting to see scripts that aren't just while you're on that site, but
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:39.080]   then install themselves and continue to run in the background using up to 80% of your
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.080]   CPU.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.080]   Not good.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.080]   Not cool.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.960]   Google's pulling them down, of course.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.480]   This is the problem with automated stuff.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.720]   In fact, did you see that Android in the Android Play Store, what was the number?
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720]   Google?
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720]   70,700 thousand.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.040]   I think it was like there may have been more zeros.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:08.280]   Apps that they had to pull off of Android, the Android Store this past year due to malware.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   That's crazy.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.920]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.720]   100,000 bad apps in 2017.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.480]   70% increase over 2016.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.600]   Not only did we remove bad apps, says Andrew on the product manager for Google Play, we're
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.960]   able to identify and act against them earlier.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:33.640]   99% of apps with abusive content were identified and rejected before anyone could install them.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   That's good news.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:45.840]   They're using machine learning to identify PHAs, phas, potentially harmful applications.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.920]   This is probably part of that Google Play Protect scanner.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.640]   Still, kind of a shocking number.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:58.000]   I mean, there's a lot of people making malicious apps.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.840]   Are you a little glad?
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.240]   I mean, there's a lot of funny.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   But a lot of it is automated.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.520]   They're making apps on apps.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:15.560]   One session I moderated in Davos was Ben Gurion University on crypto security.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.240]   What became apparent is it's going to be AI versus AI.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.040]   You have AI defenses to find all the vulnerabilities and all the patterns.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.240]   I mean, they are all robots.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   It is.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240]   It is.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:32.240]   I actually lit.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.840]   In the beginning of 2017, I put that on one of my trends because it's the beginning of
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.360]   the year you do your trend piece.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   I was like, "27.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360]   I heard 2017.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.440]   We're going to see bots fighting bots."
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   You were right.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.240]   It was too early.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.880]   We didn't really see anything bubble up to the surface yet.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.400]   I'm still waiting though.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.760]   No, no, but that's exactly what happened in crypto.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:59.920]   Just happened 700,000 apps were found by machine learning powered scanning in 2017.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.600]   So I gave you an A+ for that person.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   You win that one.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.760]   All right.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:13.600]   But it is scary and it's interesting because eventually they're going to, are they going
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.160]   to actually learn themselves?
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.760]   Actually, Quanta has a really interesting article about applying quantum computing to
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.400]   AI, which if you just want to blow your mind, you should read that.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.320]   There's, and we're also seeing how hard it is to really do quantum computing.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.560]   Yes, but we are getting better faster.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.560]   Some day maybe.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.360]   I wouldn't hold that.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   I think it's coming.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.400]   I mean, we're, you know, it's always hard at first and then suddenly you're like, "Well,
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.640]   bam, we've done it."
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.040]   And then you iterate so much faster.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:47.440]   So oh my God, I just said the word iterate.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.880]   You want to be proactive about that?
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.360]   I love this story and it's the number one shared and it's not, it hasn't any to do with
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.560]   our conversation here today.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560]   It's another one.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560]   He got some planes?
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.240]   No, it's the number one shared story on Washington Post right now.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.320]   I am certainly ashamed.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.000]   British Lord resigns after arriving late to work.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.200]   The owe you have to quit.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.720]   I would be so much trouble.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.320]   It took less than 60 seconds for Michael Bates to arrive late, apologize profusely, offer
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.400]   his resignation and then leave the House of Lords today.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:27.240]   I want to offer my sincere apologies to Baroness Lister for my discurgency and not being in
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.960]   my place to answer her question on a very important matter at the beginning of questions.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.200]   During the five years in which it's been my privilege to answer questions from this dispatcher
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.280]   box on behalf of the government, I've always believed we should rise to the highest possible
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.800]   standards of courtesy and respect and responding on behalf of the House of Lords.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.120]   Sounds just like our Congress.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.640]   To the legitimate, yes, just like our Congress.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.560]   I'm thoroughly ashamed of not being in my place and therefore I shall be offering my
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.920]   resignation to the Prime Minister with immediate effect.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:03.160]   I do apologize and then leaves.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.840]   Witnessing an apology.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.200]   Witnessing an apology turned into a resignation in a matter of seconds was simply too much
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.360]   for Bates's stunned peers.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.000]   In the dramatic video, other politicians can be heard exclaiming, "No!" from their seats.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.880]   While some laughed in disbelief, other attempts to reach out and pull Bates back into the
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.200]   chamber.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:27.280]   The Baroness said an apology from all its Bates is perfectly sufficient.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.600]   It was a minor discurgency in which any of us can be guilty of on occasion.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.760]   This is so funny.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.200]   Oh my God.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.120]   You want to hear the?
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.720]   I already read it.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   It can only be...
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.760]   Let's compare accents to what we're saying.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.120]   I'm working on my Ponzi British accent.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.840]   Watching the Queen over and over.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.320]   I mean the Crown over and over and over.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.720]   Again, while you can't get Auto Play video to stop, you can never get the video you want
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.360]   to play to start.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.200]   Now that needs an apology.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.600]   Sit in there, spin in.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.880]   Anyway, you heard it.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.400]   You heard my interpretation.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.680]   I did an interpretive reading.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.680]   I loved it.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.880]   The reason I was at The Washington Post is this story.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.640]   Facebook has a messenger for kids.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.800]   As you may know, designed for the under-13 said, although kids as young as preschoolers,
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.520]   apparently, are using it the campaign for a commercial free childhood.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:31.880]   Has signed a letter to Mark Zuckerberg that said, "You need to stop this program."
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.200]   The signatories, which include public citizen and common sense media, expressed concerns
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.560]   over boosting the screen time of young children and said this would interfere with crucial
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:47.760]   developmental skills such as reading human emotions, delaying gratification, and engaging
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   with physical world.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.760]   Books are terrible for young minds.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.240]   We have far too many books.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.840]   You think it's a technical panic?
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.360]   Well, if it's done badly, no.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.160]   But I remember my daughter when she was young was on a American Girl social network.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   Yes, that was mine.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.960]   They controlled.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.080]   And when they killed it, it was horrible disappointing to lost friends.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   They went up and smoke.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.080]   Yes.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   And they were gone.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   I think that there is a way to do it.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   I understand all the issues.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.080]   Believe me, I understand the issues.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.320]   Believe me, I see the fears and they should be regulated up the yin-yang for young children.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.720]   But I also see that in this world where we have play dates, you have to schedule and
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.280]   you don't just go out in the yard anymore and we have more isolated children.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.280]   That's true.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.080]   I don't know that it's necessarily presumptively an awful thing.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   It depends on how it's done.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   Stay safe.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.200]   Do you let your daughter wander down the street to the five and dime on her own?
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.000]   She can wander down the street to her friend's house.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.800]   I mean, I've let her do that for years.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.840]   It's nerve-wracking though, isn't it?
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840]   No.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.840]   No.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   I mean, the risks of someone kidnapping her are pretty low.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.760]   The risks of her falling and hurting herself are higher, but I'm sure people would help
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   her.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.760]   I don't know.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.560]   I'll never subscribe to that.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.200]   I will say I did let her, I convinced the neighbor next door to let her son go with
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.400]   my daughter down the street to this common area that they would had common area to play
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   in.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   Yeah, which we all did when we were kids.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.400]   Back then.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   And she was like, I don't know.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   I'm real nervous.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.400]   I'm like, it's really safe.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.440]   So she did it and then they were back late and then I sent Andrew down to find him because
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   he's like, oh my God.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   No, I'm responsible.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   Oh, this is all my fault.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.440]   Oh.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:36.800]   And they're picking up litter with their bare hands and Andrew's like, oh, they're beautiful,
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   beautiful children.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   Yes.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.760]   So do you know the book free range kids?
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   Yes.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   Uh huh.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.040]   Old friend of mine from the Daily News way back when do you subscribe to the thesis?
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.040]   I do.
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:56.560]   That I was a latch cake kid and it's my daughter doesn't want to be as independent.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.200]   So I kind of push her gently, but you know, it's hard.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.400]   It's one thing if your kid like really wants to be a free range kid and it's another thing
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.280]   if your kid's like, nope, I'm fine here.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   Proteller.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.320]   See, I think that's partly because of all these screens and all of this stuff they can
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.360]   do without leaving the house.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.560]   That is, that's the point really is that.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.720]   No, she has limited screen time.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.720]   Okay.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.440]   I think she just plays with their dolls.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.120]   She stops around on the roof.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.680]   She's doing it right now.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.080]   She writes, she writes stories.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.040]   So she spends a lot of time and she, her, her desk is behind me and she works on stuff,
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040]   scripts.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.200]   Aww, nice.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.760]   She's a kid.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.120]   She's got her own world.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.120]   Nice.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.120]   She's, she's a free range kid.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.680]   She just chooses to use the range close to home.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.640]   Facebook says it's going to push more local news stories into your news feed based on
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.720]   the geography of the clicks.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.240]   What do you think of this?
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.080]   Jeff, this is yet another change to.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.480]   So, so Facebook, when they, when they basically what happened, I don't know if we talked
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.440]   about this because I was gone last week, when they made the change.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.160]   What I saw and I had this conversation with Facebook people at CUNY when I brought in somebody
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.640]   to talk to product development people, we asked them what's news and Facebook saw the
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.920]   world in two buckets.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.720]   There was social content on Facebook and there was public content and everything was in public
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   content.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.880]   So when some of the stuff in public content got them in trouble, they threw out the whole
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.920]   bathtub and with it went news.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   So as you know, they're pulling it back now bit by bit.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:41.640]   They have this odd structure to survey a small number of people to find out what is widely
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.920]   trusted and that stuff's starting to come back and that's the obvious.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:49.040]   The New York Times is going to be their yes box news is going to be there and others.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.880]   And then they wanted to also put local in local is easy to put in.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   So it's geography.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.000]   So they're putting that stuff in, which is fine.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.920]   The hard part is going to be how do they put in foreign affairs or twig or or the correspondent
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.920]   or these other things.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:08.440]   And I'm, you know, trying to suggest some methodologies publicly to them and others about trust and
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:13.280]   distrust and it's God's work to try to get them promote more, more good and important
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.280]   news.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.560]   That's going to be very difficult and I don't think it's going to be as easy as an algorithm.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.440]   However, I'm glad to see that local news is getting promoted by Facebook in this way.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.200]   And Google also has started its new thing called bulletin in three cities where people
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:34.760]   the way below a property use this time can contribute directly to the web without having
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.720]   a website local news will see how that works.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.560]   But the fact that local is coming up in there and their views, I think is a good thing.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560]   It's a good thing.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   Tell me about this bulletin thing.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.400]   So right now you have to sign up for early access.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.600]   That's Oakland and two other cities.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   I forget where they are.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.320]   So I wouldn't be accepted because they have no Petaluma, although Petaluma would be the
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.120]   perfect place to do it would be would be as opposed to a big city where I mean, I don't
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.120]   know.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.120]   So it's an app.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   You put it on your phone.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.160]   Basically, rather than sharing something to Instagram, I think you're sharing something
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   to your town.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   It's interesting.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   Nashville, Tennessee, Oakland, California.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160]   So is it like a next door?
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:16.000]   I think different in that it's not a clue that next door is very closed on purpose.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   This is verified identity.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.600]   It's just the people you choose to do who really do live next to you.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.160]   I think this is broader than that.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.160]   I think.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.160]   Next door.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.880]   I mean, I guess I'm in my neighborhood, but it's a pretty big.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.000]   I mean, there's like hundreds of people.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.640]   Well, they brought it over the time originally I was supposed to be like 75 to something like
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.640]   that.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.040]   And then like in my neighborhood, I started during Hurricane Sandy and there weren't enough
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.040]   people.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.280]   So now next door includes people who are three miles away, which is a little ridiculous.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:51.120]   So I signed up just to see at the end, they say, do you work in media?
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.920]   So I think probably we'll be rejected.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.720]   But you have kudies.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.440]   Maybe they'll trust you more.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.120]   Maybe that would be better if you maybe.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.160]   So but this is kind of what CNN did.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:08.120]   Remember, you know, they decide all of a sudden all their news gathering would be by people
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.920]   with smartphones and.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920]   Is that I report?
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.920]   Yep.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:13.920]   Yep.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.320]   That just died of not the death.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.040]   Like all these things die.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   Although they still, I mean, anytime anything trends on Twitter, they ask you for your.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.280]   Your your footage.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.280]   Well, I can think of things like remember the miracle on the Hudson, where Sully landed
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.600]   the airplane on the Hudson River.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:40.160]   You know, the definitive pictures of that were all from people with smartphones on fairies.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.880]   There's a there's a business bill, a store full verifies this social news content.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.480]   Oh, so they.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.880]   It's a store.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880]   I died.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880]   So I died.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880]   I died.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   This is for full.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880]   I understand.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.240]   I have a fusion store full was bought by news Corp, which some might consider a death, but
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:02.120]   I've that's a joke.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.200]   I did say you would get to pick, build, pick your own.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.680]   You want to talk about the follower factory?
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.680]   Sure.
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.680]   Great.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.560]   I think it's like a Jeff story on the New York Times on Sunday.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:20.120]   And by the way, we are talking on Sunday about also the really nicely done lay the graphical
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.280]   layout on this the way they the times is occasionally, I'll do this with an article,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.480]   really make it visual.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:36.280]   But it's about a company called was it Devumi, which sells fake followers.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.760]   And they talk about fake followers in it.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.200]   And they even name names.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:50.280]   And you know, what's interesting that some of the people who names were named have had
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.840]   some consequences from this.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:21:00.920]   So they showed here's the heat map, for instance, for here, it's not loaded yet.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.800]   This is uses Web GL.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.960]   So it's probably not going to work very well.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.200]   It's working pretty well.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.240]   You can see how there it is.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:23.520]   This is the heat map from a chef, chef Simon, who had a huge number of bots that he paid
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.440]   for apparently and admitted to.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.200]   Who was it that got in trouble?
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   Richard Rooper.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.200]   That's right.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.200]   Richard Rooper.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.800]   I don't know if that's right.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.560]   It's a waste of money and it's egotistical.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.160]   But I don't know that it was a firing offense or suspended.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:47.840]   Did you do it for ego or did you do it because his bosses asked him to get more Twitter followers?
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.960]   I remember maybe if he got paid, if he got paid bonuses based on following, then maybe
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.200]   that's it is definitely the case I've heard from people who should know that in Hollywood,
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:03.880]   you can often get much more money for a contract as an actor if you have more Twitter followers.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.880]   There's a direct correlation because you're considered to have some market clout and multi-million
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.880]   Twitter.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.080]   So there's strong incentive for people to boost their followers.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.080]   I mean, you make-
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.680]   The ones who really are incentive are the so-called influencers who are paid for talking
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.680]   things.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.680]   Right.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.680]   I had an influencer.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680]   I had an influencer.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   225,000 followers.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.000]   That's a lot of followers.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   That's a lot.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   I have more than that.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.640]   I've never paid.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:31.640]   He was-
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.400]   I was paid to be your follower, Leo.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.040]   You pay as little as a penny per follower.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.840]   It's very inexpensive.
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.880]   He had 226,000 followers as of money.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.440]   It dropped from 253,000 a year ago.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.920]   So part of this, I think, is Twitter kills followers.
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:52.880]   That's the other side of this story I've been seeing people saying a number of big accounts
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.600]   have lost dramatic numbers of followers in the last few days since that article came out.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   What about Trump?
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:04.160]   So what Roper's punishment was he's under investigation and the Chicago Sun Times, his
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:09.880]   newspaper will not be publishing any reviews or columns until he's by Roper until investigation
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   is complete.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.880]   I think that is-
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:19.480]   No, I guess you could argue that it's like an ethics violation.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.480]   Misrepresentation.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:23.880]   Do you want your journalist to be presumably as ethical as possible?
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:29.720]   It's unquestionably dumb, but in this range of sins.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:35.880]   So Hillary Rosen, former president of the RIAA and a political commentator, CNN contributor,
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:44.240]   and I think she worked on the Clinton campaign, paid for half a million Twitter followers.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:53.840]   It's humiliating to have this be revealed because it seems like you're grasping for followers
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:24:00.680]   but I don't know what the punishment should be.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.160]   We all have fake followers.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.240]   That's part of the problem.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:12.600]   According to some of these social follower count sites, half of my followers are fake,
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:20.320]   which is not because I paid for them, but their bots are spam or whatever.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.360]   Did you see the Mark Cuban tweet this last week?
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360]   Nope.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360]   So Cuban-Gusuentide Stacy.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.360]   Sorry.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.240]   She would have been so subtle when we had to hear this or anything, but I just thought
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.840]   I'd be nice to say Gusuentide.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.720]   So Cuban said, "That's it.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.720]   That's it.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.120]   Everything has to be verified person."
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.760]   And a lot of us came in and said, "No, you've got to remember about- he discussed
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.240]   back with me and others.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.280]   You have to remember about people who were vulnerable and having a verified identity.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:55.320]   He wasn't so much talking about your name, so much as saying it's one per person.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.640]   And there are some bots that are okay.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   It's not as simple as say, "Ah, there they got the solution.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.640]   Let's just get rid of them."
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.400]   Oh, I have three Twitter accounts.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.400]   Yes, Twitter accounts.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.200]   You have three?
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.480]   Which one is the real Stacy?
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.640]   Well, Gigas Stacy is my primary.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.120]   Stacy number one or Stacy number two.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.100]   No, I have a Leo LePorte, which is my primary one, but I also have a bot called Chief Twit
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.100]   Bot.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.600]   So it's not a secret.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.120]   And it tweets out things about shows and stuff.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.160]   I used to have a partial version of it in fake Matthew Ingram.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.520]   Fake Matthew Ingram.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.640]   We created that at Giga-Om for him.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.480]   Oh, you did?
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.440]   It was Yanko, Brett Gers.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.720]   He came up with the idea and then we all took- he gave all of us the account and we asked
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.960]   his permission.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.960]   Oh.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.560]   But, well, yeah, because we worked with him.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560]   Twitter, he's Canadian.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:54.560]   Twitter begs to have multiple accounts created.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   I had an account for my dog.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.560]   I had an account for him.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:06.160]   And then people have created accounts like Leo's hair, Leo's table.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160]   There's a lot of accounts out there.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.160]   They're mostly on board.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.360]   They get as they should because it's boring.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:18.160]   But I have Stacey on IoT, which I'm not using now, but eventually will.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   So, you know.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.400]   It's also a good idea to create accounts preemptively to keep people from making accounts like Leo
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.480]   Laport sucks, which I don't own.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480]   But I mean, that's probably-
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480]   I could do that for you.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.840]   I had an account for my scale because my scale would tweet my weight.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.880]   That was a bad idea.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.480]   Fortunately, the batteries died.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.320]   That's too bad.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.880]   There is no way to replace them.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.360]   It just stopped working.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.520]   So what's the rule?
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.880]   What should the principle be on A, bots and B fake accounts?
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.280]   Because I just can't stop somebody from following you.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280]   You could.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280]   You could block them.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.160]   So when I get spam, I report it from a bot follower.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.720]   I report it immediately and then block.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   So that's-
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720]   No, I'm asking if you're Twitter.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.440]   Oh, Twitter's rule.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.440]   What should the principle?
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.920]   What should it be in an ideal world?
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.160]   What would you propose?
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160]   Stacey.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.160]   Do you want to others?
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160]   No.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.240]   God, you guys, can't we all just get a log?
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240]   Stacey.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.240]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.520]   Yeah, I think it's challenging for Twitter.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520]   I really do.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.160]   I'm not one of those people who hate on Twitter all the time.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.520]   I get that this is a complex issue.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.880]   I don't think naming people is right.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.000]   I mean, having people proactively report bots is good if you actually do something about
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   it.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   I don't know.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.760]   It's intent matters, right?
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.520]   So for Leo to start his chief put bot is fine.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.600]   The intent is to inform and news sites have it and so on.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   That's fine.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.840]   A bot that's going to give me the weather or going to give me bargains.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.920]   It's fine.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.400]   The bots that are there to what?
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.760]   What are the what are the sins?
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   Okay.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.120]   So what would the sins be attacking people?
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.680]   Do you want to see misinformation?
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:26.320]   Yeah, I think spreading not only creating it, but spreading it that is there for the purpose
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.960]   of spreading this information.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960]   Okay.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.600]   I would add obscenity.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.480]   Screw that Stacey.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.080]   You know, it's so funny because normally I would be engaged in this conversation.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080]   I couldn't care less.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.120]   How's your hate Twitter?
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.880]   Let Twitter be Twitter.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.160]   Well, it's not that I hate Twitter, but it's just it's, you know, it's like saying, what
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.120]   should we do about that landfill over there?
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.160]   Should we, uh, should we Facebook earnings?
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.160]   How's that?
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.160]   Yes, I got Facebook earnings.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.480]   I got a couple of stories still ago.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.720]   Google flights is using a little AI.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.360]   Remember we were saying how AI is going to mean everything?
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.520]   You're going to predict delays and show how bad basic economy fares are in the Google
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.520]   flights.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.880]   So if you're using Google to do your flight booking, that's great.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:16.800]   I think you'll know, you know, how reliably on time a flight will be based on, you know,
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.440]   previous records.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.200]   And then let's talk about Facebook.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:31.360]   Mark, Mark, Mark, Zuckerberg, Mark, Zuckerberg.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.720]   Oh, no, never mind.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.720]   Oh, no.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.680]   Some marker, Mark Zuckerberg says that showing fewer viral videos on Facebook has reduced.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Get this.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:46.720]   This is, this is why every little knob tweak on Facebook can make a difference has reduced
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:53.120]   time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours a day.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.120]   What percentage is that?
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:57.840]   I don't know, but geez, that's, you know, that's why.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.080]   Are they how many users are they at now?
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.080]   Two billion?
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.920]   Daily active users daily daily 1.4 billion.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:06.920]   Okay.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:09.320]   Monthly active users, 2.13 billion.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.560]   That's the over two now over two.
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:22.400]   So advertising revenue grew 89% 89% capital expenditures, 2.6.
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.880]   Who cares how much they spent?
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.080]   How much did you make?
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.880]   Head count up 47% 25,000.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   That's nothing.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.960]   You can borrow that to an old newspaper company.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.840]   Think about what the revenue, you know, per employee is in a company like that.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.960]   But you can figure that out.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:53.000]   For the month, three months for the quarter ending December 31st, 2017, $4.3 billion for
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.080]   the year, $15.9 billion.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.160]   That's up 50% over last year.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.800]   So divide that by 25,000.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.800]   Will you?
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.800]   Somebody?
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:04.800]   Chat room?
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.800]   A lot of money.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.320]   Their profit is up 56% year over year.
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.640]   20% of the quarter, right?
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.640]   And he's warning.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:18.560]   Not gonna stay this way because, you know, we made changes.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.480]   But by focusing on meaningful connections, says Mr. Zed, our community and businesses
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:27.320]   will be stronger over the long term.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:33.640]   In 2018, we were focused on making sure Facebook isn't just fun to use, but also good for
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.880]   people's well-being and for society.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:42.280]   We do this by encouraging meaningful connections between people rather than passive consumption
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]   of content.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.120]   Content's a bit.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.120]   Okay.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:51.720]   I would like to point out because Shira Oviday, I don't know how to say her name, his name
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.960]   or name, I don't know, pointed this out.
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.520]   And we used to track this at Gigahome because Facebook has a lot of servers.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:04.400]   Their CapEx is going up to 14 to 15 billion in 2018.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:08.040]   That is more than double what they spent in 2017.
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.960]   Does that include employees or is it just physical?
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.480]   No, that's just physical assets.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.480]   So that's data centers.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480]   Is that the real estate?
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:18.480]   It should, yes.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:22.080]   So like their new data center spending is mostly most of their capital.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.520]   It's probably all data centers, yeah.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.520]   That's, well, that's a lot.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.120]   That's a forecast.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.400]   That is a forecast.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.400]   That's a investment.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.240]   That's, they've got it.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.040]   I mean, maybe it's more along the lines of wireless as well, you know, because they do
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:42.640]   have some lovely antenna technologies useful for Leo, your 5G network.
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.680]   Yeah, well, I don't want the government to take that over.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.880]   Which would be worse, government taking it over, Facebook taking it over.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.320]   So that's the same argument people had about Google fiber.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   Right.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.320]   So that's the way it may live.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:02.200]   So, so I mean, I think, so I wrote a post, I wrote two posts after the changes.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.680]   One was my concerns about the changes that I wrote.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:11.000]   Another one say that I think that both Facebook and media are looking at community too shallowly
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.840]   and temporarily.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:17.240]   And so Facebook's goal is to get more, what was it?
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:20.200]   Meaningful engagements between people.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.840]   And so I obnoxiously edited that and said it should be more meaningful and long lasting
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.960]   engagements among people.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.240]   And that they're measuring community as does media now based on conversation.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.280]   And my fear is that we're going to move from clickbait to comment bait.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.680]   Hey, a lot of people talked about that.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680]   I got to be talking about it.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680]   Must be good.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:40.720]   And that's, that's a very shallow view of community.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.440]   Community is when you join together to do something together to act.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.800]   We lost all the Kwanis clubs and rotary clubs of the world.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.040]   And what can you really start on Facebook that has a deeper version of community?
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:57.120]   So I'm coming to think that Facebook is very much evolutionary and that there's a, there's
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:01.040]   another leap to be made in their definition, definition of community.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:06.560]   And he talks about it, but the current definition I think is rather thin.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.480]   Yeah, it fosters slacktivism.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:18.600]   It can, but it could also, I mean, it's like the founding of meetup, meetup was inspired
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.440]   by the book, bowling alone, because people, the clubs were going away.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.520]   The bowling leagues were going away.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.520]   We want to get people together in person again, whether in person or not.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.880]   I think we want to have a deeper definition of what it means to join with other people
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.320]   in the community.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:37.600]   And I think Facebook's trying to get there, but I think there's a big step left.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:43.560]   I would also say that there's not, there, there's also that is one definition of community,
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.680]   but not everybody wants to take action.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.080]   Some people, even in the world of the rotary clubs, just wanted to go sit at their neighbor's
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.080]   house and gossip.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.080]   Me too.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.080]   So, yeah, not, not that you know somebody a little deeper.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.240]   Um, no, no.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:02.680]   I like, I like going home alone and playing with my computers and watching TV.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.560]   Well, it's like, that's all I really want.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   It's an introvert.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   I'm like, yeah.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.560]   Exactly.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.560]   And I think you need to over rate it.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.680]   I think your daughter is an introvert now.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:13.680]   I think everyone in my family is.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680]   Here's the funny thing.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.680]   I heart introverts.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.680]   We're three introverts.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.080]   What are we doing right now?
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.080]   We're on TV.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.240]   We're presuming that the world cares about what we have to say for two hours.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.440]   I was talking about this was Lisa yesterday.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:34.520]   Because, but what, but what I do is what we do is I know is the is, is it is only apparently
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.440]   extroverted.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.480]   A lot of performers are introverts.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.960]   Johnny Carson was famously an introvert.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.240]   And you say, well, how can he be an introvert?
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:49.400]   He's performing, but performance like this and like what he did is actually more internal
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   than you think.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.680]   I like how you just compared yourself to Johnny Carson.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:58.160]   Well, you have a problem.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.600]   I wish I were Johnny Carson.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.520]   I wish I was Johnny Carson.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.480]   But I think, I know, I know, I think Letterman's an introvert.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:09.800]   I think a lot of performers say more about what makes it internal.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.280]   It's just, I'm just telling you the feeling of it.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.840]   I don't know what your feeling is when you do it.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.320]   But I mean, I used to do radio shows and my eyes closed.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:22.720]   I don't do it now because we're on camera, but it's really very much.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.560]   It's not in a, it's not like we're really having a conversation exactly.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.360]   I don't know.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:33.960]   It wouldn't, it wouldn't, it would seem to be that we were sitting around talking.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.320]   But Leo mentally has his eyes closed.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.320]   I don't know.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   Just in my head.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.320]   He wants to be home.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.320]   I don't know.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.800]   It's not, I don't remember it's an act.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.800]   It's not, it's not even this, I'm not, not considered performing is performance.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.840]   Yeah, it's, it's a person like I was talking to a friend of mine.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.840]   And after I had given a talk and he's like, and we went out for drinks afterwards and
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:01.480]   we're talking about being introverts and he's like, no way.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.720]   I was like, oh, yes way.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.320]   He's like, oh, this is your Stacey performance.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.480]   I was like, oh yeah.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.200]   But that's how you can be speaking in public, I think.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.200]   Yes.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.200]   Yes, I turn it all on.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.320]   Speaking in public is a good, is a better example than this because it's, it is.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320]   This is more like a conversation.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.080]   But if you're on a stage giving a speech, you're actually more alone than if you were
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.440]   in a bar sitting and talking to people.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.000]   You're really on a stage by yourself.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.080]   Like, why would I talk to people that are.
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.040]   I know, I know I could just go home and knit.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.040]   Or knit.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.040]   Okay.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.160]   Let's see, what else, what else do we have to talk about?
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.080]   Oh, you want to change the subject, Ms. Introvert?
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:42.560]   Well, I just, I feel, no, I just feel like this is probably not engaging.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.960]   Nobody cares about our.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960]   It's about us Stacey.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]   It's about us.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   That's because we're introverts.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:48.960]   Yes.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.600]   But I think we've, I think actually we've gone through all the good stories unless you
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.600]   have something.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.600]   Oh, good.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.600]   Then I can, then I can use my thing as my tip for y'all.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   Yes.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.160]   Save your thing.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   Save your thing.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.560]   Uh, are you going to order the book that Bill Gates says is the thing.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:11.160]   So this is an interesting question because Stephen Pinker, who's the author of the, what
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   was it called?
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.720]   The better, better, better, dangerous of our nature, which is out and you can order it.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.480]   And I did order that on Audible so I could listen to it.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:24.920]   And then I, I tweeted the Bill Gates said his favorite book of all time was that.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:29.240]   And now Stephen Pinker has a new book called Enlightenment Now, which isn't out yet, but
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.320]   will be out soon.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.440]   And so I haven't been able to order it.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.320]   But now, and by the way, the case for his reason, science, humanism and progress.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.120]   And I gather from reading Gates's blog posts that really he's an optimist, right?
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.960]   He's, he says, the world is better than ever before.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.360]   Um, but he gives so much data.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.760]   This thing is like a college like we have it.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:55.240]   I've read part of it and I was like, Oh my God, just no more.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.320]   Well, it's very dense, very dense.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.880]   So the enlightenment now boats, we'll be out till 13th.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.720]   Yeah, he likes data.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:09.160]   And I got a email from some people who said that Stephen Pinker isn't an alt right apologist.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.840]   So I don't know what that means, but no, that is actually so, I mean, confirmed that
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:14.840]   this is actually true.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.520]   This is actually a fake news.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.480]   Oh, hold on.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.040]   Yeah, it was on a panel.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.680]   And what they did is yes.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.920]   Yeah, they cut off.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.200]   They cut a small part of a lecture.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:32.680]   And it was, it was an unfair, very unfair cut.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:38.120]   They quoted the, his quote, the often highly literate, highly intelligent people who gravitate
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.320]   to the alt right.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.320]   Yes.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.320]   He was warning about them.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   Don't underestimate.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   Yes.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.320]   But he is, he is not.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.320]   So don't.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.000]   So, but yes, the alt right decided to use that in paint.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.560]   Stephen, not that his, you know, anyway, yes, fake news in action.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.800]   He was at both Davos and DLD.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.200]   I didn't get to see him, unfortunately.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.160]   So I should read this book.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.760]   I think we have to go down.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.640]   It's the most ever favorite book.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:11.800]   Well, I got the better angels of our nature first because that's the one that's available.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.800]   I'll listen to that.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.800]   And I, I almost pre-ordered enlightenment now.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.480]   And then I thought, well, let me listen to the first one, make sure he's not an idiot.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.120]   I read another one of his that was, oh, what was it?
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.520]   Sometimes I read this stuff and I just conclude, oh, the guys, because this kind of sent,
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:34.240]   kind of syncretic kind of stuff, which is merging all of these things into some grand
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.240]   revelation.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.240]   A lot of times.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.800]   No, no, he is not like a Malcolm Gladwell.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.800]   He is way.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.800]   A lot of times.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.160]   Malcolm Gladwell is a good example of that.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.320]   I can grab my boat and show it to you and you will just be like, oh my God.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.440]   Do you have a lot of post it notes in there?
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:50.400]   No, it's just, it's, it's like a textbook.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.400]   Okay.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.400]   Good.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.400]   I can't wait to listen then.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.760]   So I know one more quick question.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:00.400]   So we're all, I think loyal here to Audible as am I and I listen Audible, but I'm curious
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.240]   when you have any reaction to Google finally and play.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.160]   Yeah, it's not interesting.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.160]   And not the price is not a club.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.720]   It's just discounted books.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.720]   What do you think?
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.520]   So Google Books is getting a complete revamp and one of the things will be the ability to
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.000]   buy audio books.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.760]   But you know, if you think about it, this isn't that new.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.760]   Just odd.
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.120]   They didn't have before.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.120]   It is.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.480]   Apple's take has iTunes audio books, but they're from Audible.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.880]   But but almost every publisher puts out audio books.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:38.920]   The thing that makes, so you can get fire and fury from, you know, Apple from Audible
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.200]   from there's one called, what is it down?
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.560]   Let me see.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.920]   Downpour down.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:49.800]   Downpour, which is another audio book club.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:51.920]   And it has all the same books.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920]   It does.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.400]   The only thing that it doesn't have is the Audible Originals.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.880]   And I think that's one of the reasons Audible does Originals.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.920]   And boy, some of those are really, do you ever listen to the one about the, the, the
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.800]   water, butterfly effect, John Ross?
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:06.800]   You listen to it?
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:07.800]   Not yet, but I have it.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:08.800]   It's really good.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.320]   My problem is I love audio books so much I just buy, I buy two a month and then, you
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.520]   know, I don't get to them all.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.520]   They stack up.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.520]   They stack up.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.520]   So this will be interesting.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.880]   The one reason I think they're doing this is because Amazon's Echo has a huge advantage
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.960]   when it comes to audio books.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:25.560]   You can listen to your Audible books on it and Google, none of the Google devices will
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:28.560]   play audio books, but they will now.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.400]   Except for Android Auto, which will take a little time and they'll, they'll, they'll
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   add you that in.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.040]   You know, I think the prices will end up being the same.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.600]   They say now 50% off your first book, but my question, you know, there's things you
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.600]   can do.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.560]   Amazon, for instance, has, oh, I don't want to download Chrome.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560]   Oh God.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560]   Jeez.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:56.920]   These companies at Microsoft and Google and just add each other's throat.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.320]   Come on, use Chrome, Chrome's faster.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.480]   And then if you, if you launch edge, it actually showed speed dials.
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.720]   You see it's faster.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   It's faster.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.720]   You should.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:14.200]   So, but things like Amazon has like flat rate subscriptions and things like, and I'm
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.480]   one, you know, Audible is.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.720]   Yeah, which is a better, which is a better deal.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.520]   I'm wondering if Google's going to start, if I'd love to see a price war, the promise
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:27.480]   they're all like, they're all copy protected, which means when you buy it from Google, you
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.120]   have to listen to it from Google.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.120]   Yes.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.120]   Bye from model.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.680]   That's one advantage downpour has not some of them are now being copy protected, but a
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.200]   lot of them are not.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.080]   So you do audible audio books.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.240]   I like to read.
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.240]   I read fast.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.680]   I'm a very fast reader.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.320]   So Audible slows me down.
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:48.600]   You can listen to two, two X or I still too slow.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.480]   I mean, yeah, I just.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.840]   I have one drive.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.840]   Anybody's.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.840]   I don't have a commute.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:58.840]   That's the other.
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.240]   And we should also mention Audible as a sponsor of.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.480]   That's why I mentioned it.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   Yes, we do.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.400]   But I do think it's interesting that Google's doing this.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.800]   I'll probably see it.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.400]   It's the same thing as the point really is it's the same book.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:16.000]   Because so if you're a Daniel Suarez fan, it's not audible doesn't record this book.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.360]   It's recorded by his publisher, Penguin Random House.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.480]   Audible sells it, Google sells it, downpour sells it.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.880]   So you know, by the way, the production value of these things has gone way.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.440]   Oh, I love it.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.440]   Geez.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.160]   Sometimes a little over the top, but generally good.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.960]   I'm listening, Lisa and I are listening.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:43.120]   We like to have a book we listen to together and we're listening to Stephen Fry read the
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:44.880]   Sherlock Holmes stories.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.640]   Oh, that'd be fun.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.640]   Yeah, it's a good family.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640]   It's a good family.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.640]   Listen.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640]   Yeah, we do audio.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.440]   So we do audible for car trips.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.440]   Yes.
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.760]   Like when we go back and so we listen to Neil Patrick Harris read.
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:58.760]   Fun, fun.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.240]   Henry Hudgens, I think.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:02.240]   I think your daughter's old.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.520]   Yeah, Henry Hudgens is great.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.280]   I think your daughter's old enough for Sherlock Holmes.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.440]   She's right about that age where you start discovering.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.680]   I mean, this is just Google.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.160]   This is more to me, Google versus Amazon.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.840]   There's a big battle, Bruin.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:18.840]   It's not brewing.
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:19.840]   It's it's on.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:22.720]   It is on, which is, which is good.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.000]   Is on.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.520]   Let us unless you guys have anything else.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.360]   I think you, I think you did it, boss.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.640]   I think you got them all in there.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.560]   What do you think, Stacy?
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.120]   Um, yes, I'm so sorry, you guys.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:40.600]   No, you've done very well, Stacy.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.920]   And I'm giving Kathy.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.840]   I would never have known.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:45.440]   Never in a million years.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:47.280]   I'm like, what?
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:48.760]   People are talking to me.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.400]   No, why don't you kick things off with your pick of the week and then you can go home?
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:53.760]   Then you can then you can collapse.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.000]   I can just pop my head down and just go.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000]   Um, okay.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.680]   Pick of the week is you can now send texts if you have an Android phone using your Madam
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.680]   A.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:05.680]   I've been trying to figure this out.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:06.680]   Have you done it?
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.680]   Yes, it works.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:09.880]   So do you start where?
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:13.200]   You go to your Echo app, Madam A's app.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.200]   Okay.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.800]   And then you go into the little conversation section.
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.560]   So it's that little thing that looks like a thought bubble.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.560]   Yeah, good.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:22.560]   Okay.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.760]   And then you get a pop up.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:28.040]   Ask, you know, who to send SMS?
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.040]   So it'll go.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.000]   It can only doesn't work with an iPhone yet because Apple has no API.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   Of course.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.200]   So you do that and you take your permissions and scroll down.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.600]   Allow drop in, show caller ID, send it.
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:41.600]   Okay.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.040]   And I'll send it from my Google five phone number, which is kind of funny.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:50.520]   And I can do the same with, with, uh, your Google, right?
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.520]   Yes.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.840]   You've always been able to do that.
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:53.840]   Oh, we did that.
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.840]   And Siri.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.720]   So now I can say Madam A text, anyone in my context, it sends both.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.880]   And so when you do the message, so I was like, Hey, Kevin, did you get this?
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.600]   Question mark and it sent it perfectly.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.960]   But it also sends an audio message that you can click on.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:11.040]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:15.920]   So if you get some weird transcriptions because it's just, you know, the car could just play
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.920]   it for you rather than badly.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920]   Yes.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:22.080]   Now that only stays around for 24 hours, it says.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.880]   So I assume that's just not to live in.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:30.240]   It appears in your SMS, whatever your preferred SMS reader is.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:33.680]   So there you go.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.640]   Good tip.
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.480]   Mr Jarvis, Mr J.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.040]   I think we should do this.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.320]   Google I/O has been announced for May 8 and Facebook F8 for May 1, which we've been making
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.200]   two trips in two weeks to California.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.440]   Hope you come visit us.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.440]   I hope.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.920]   I hope I hope.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.920]   That sounds like fun.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.920]   I don't know if I'll go to Google I/O again this year.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:54.160]   I was going to say, are you going to broadcast from Google I/O?
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.320]   We went last year.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.320]   We had to be miserable.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.320]   It was fun.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.080]   We got help from Googlers.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.480]   And then the audio was all messed up.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.480]   All right.
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.880]   Well, you can figure that out.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.000]   Yeah, maybe we will.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.240]   What do you think, Carson?
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:09.000]   Should we do Google I/O again this year?
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000]   It was so boring.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.680]   The only thing good about it was you and Jason hanging out with you and Jason.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.240]   It was fun.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:23.880]   And that Russian programmer who little did we know was there to hack the vote.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.920]   Oh, no, that wasn't last year.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.920]   He'd already had a vote.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.800]   Just remember that there was a guy in our box from Russia?
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.880]   That's right.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.680]   Yeah, I almost asked him.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.840]   Hey, buddy, can I follow you to Twitter feed?
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.720]   Twitter feed.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.520]   So would you go to F8?
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.520]   I've never been to F8.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.120]   I think that would be fun, actually.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.680]   But I don't know how to go into that.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   You have to get me to credentials.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680]   Oh, we can get me to F8.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.960]   I've never met Zark.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:53.960]   You haven't?
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:57.040]   Oh, I'm sorry when I meet him.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.320]   I was going to say it now that you've renamed him.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.600]   Maybe he won't invite you.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.600]   Zark, Muckaboo.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.440]   Oh, it's not the first time he's heard that I guarantee you.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.800]   He went to Harvard for crying out loud.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:09.560]   Kait Harvard has a nickname.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:10.560]   OK.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.560]   I used to snort.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:13.560]   I didn't go to Harvard, though.
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:18.480]   A guy named Dink turned out-- I told this before.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.800]   I never started coke with him.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.280]   Well, actually, once I did.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.760]   But I didn't like coke.
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   I noticed he rolled up $100 bill to do it at Dink.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.840]   And his last name was Morgan.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.920]   And I found out the reason he used Dink is because his first name
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.680]   was JP.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:32.520]   Oh.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.160]   Jeez.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.200]   Now I wonder why he went with hundreds.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:37.000]   Get $1,000.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.520]   Come on, enjoy yourself.
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:41.480]   I want to meet Zark.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.800]   Can you arrange that?
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.080]   I haven't seen him in a while.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:48.120]   President Zark.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.120]   Oh, my wife's coming in to say--
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:50.640]   don't say that.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.200]   You're not allowed.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:56.400]   It was a long time ago, and a galaxy far, far away.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.440]   It was one time.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.400]   One time I did it.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.760]   I didn't like it.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.760]   If you had paid in Bitcoin, the feds could find you.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:07.520]   Think how valuable that would have been.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.160]   Did you see the great article about the guy who created--
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.200]   this is my pick.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.400]   Just because I didn't have anything else.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:17.240]   So I'm going to coinmarketcap.com.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.680]   He's a one-man band.
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:25.200]   It's something like the top 20 sites on the internet now,
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:26.960]   because everybody's following Bitcoin.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:28.760]   But what's really interesting-- so this
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:32.040]   shows you the value of all of your--
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:36.240]   it has the top 100 cryptocurrencies.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:38.280]   And so you could see the market capitalization,
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:39.960]   the current value of graph.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960]   But at one point, this guy--
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.520]   well, he's got a lot of ads all of a sudden.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.880]   They didn't used to have ads on here.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.120]   That's interesting.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:51.080]   At one point-- oh, maybe that's because I had an ad blocker.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.560]   I never saw all these ads.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:58.200]   At one point, he decided to delist the Korean exchanges,
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.880]   and because he felt that they were not
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.720]   matching the rest of the world from his charts.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:10.440]   And he caused a 10% drop in the value of cryptocurrency
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.800]   all by himself.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:14.200]   Not even trying to.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.880]   No, he didn't tell anybody.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:18.560]   Everybody's saying, what happened?
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.120]   Great article.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:22.600]   I think it was in the New York Times.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.480]   So Bitcoin is down to $10,000?
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.400]   $10,000.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   So I'm still ahead.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:28.960]   Now, since--
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:29.800]   Oh, by much.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:35.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think it might be a good time to--
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.200]   and Leslie so wants to spank me publicly.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:41.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.400]   I did ask Stacy if she's in--
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:45.120]   in the South by.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.120]   It's a go.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.840]   Can I say this answer?
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:50.040]   Can I say who?
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.480]   Capital One.
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.080]   So we're going to be in the Capital One
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.040]   Pavilion at Antones.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.920]   I know, but I thought if you've said no,
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.640]   I'd edit it.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.840]   So it actually is official.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.600]   So Stacy's going to look and see.
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.120]   She's going to talk to her husband
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:07.920]   and find out if 9 AM on March.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:08.920]   8.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:09.920]   I thought you said 9.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.720]   No, 8 and we started 8.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.680]   We started at 8.30 AM, sorry.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.560]   Bittopper boss.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:17.720]   Hey, it's 8.30 for you.
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.000]   It's 6.30 for me.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.840]   Will you have coffee, but--
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:21.680]   Oh, I will.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.400]   Then you'll be back on caffeine, a year old team.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:24.760]   We'll have salmon.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:25.280]   No, no, no.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.560]   Breakfast, tacos, breakfast.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.560]   Breakfast, tacos, you got it.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:28.760]   Oh, breakfast, tacos.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.520]   And a variety of hot sauces.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:32.520]   OK.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.520]   Breakfast, tacos.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:34.720]   Breakfast, tacos, and--
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:37.520]   Where would you like your breakfast tacos from?
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:41.600]   You know, if it's an official event, no, I'll be there.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.680]   I actually get up early.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:43.680]   It's not a problem.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.120]   But where would you-- no, I'm telling you.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:45.880]   I'm going to bribe you.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:46.960]   Where would you-- oh.
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.040]   Also, because I will be dining on them as well,
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.680]   I'd like to know where the best breakfast tacos are in Austin.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:52.640]   Well, it depends on what you like.
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:53.960]   I like Taco Deli.
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:55.120]   Taco Deli it is.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:56.400]   And I like their donut sauce.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.560]   Please, please make a note of that.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.240]   Their donut sauce?
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:02.720]   No, donut or donut.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.440]   Do NNA.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:05.640]   Do NNA.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.200]   Do NNA, with a tilde, I think.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.160]   Donia.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:08.640]   Donia.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:09.560]   Donia sauce.
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.920]   Donia Maria.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.080]   All right.
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.040]   Everybody's invited.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.120]   South by Southwest.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.040]   Antons.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:16.920]   Antons.
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:17.760]   Antons.
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:19.200]   Is it on 6th?
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:19.880]   Antons.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.800]   The corner is 6th and-- what?
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:23.400]   6th in Colorado.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:26.120]   Hey, if you're in Austin, you just ask anybody.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:28.120]   Where's Antons?
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:28.680]   And they'll tell you--
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:33.160]   And they'll go 6th in Quad-- 6th in Colorado?
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.640]   And it's going to be early.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:39.200]   It's day one of South by Southwest Interactive.
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.400]   And we are going to do a piece on--
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.680]   it's 5th and 6th.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.160]   That doesn't make any sense.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.520]   No, I'm looking to see the cross streets.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.520]   It's fan and--
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:51.520]   It's C.V. Ray Vaughan.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.080]   And it used to play there on a regular basis.
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:55.760]   He won't be playing there this time.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:56.520]   Antons.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.120]   Ninth Club.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:00.000]   First opening on 6th in 1975.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:00.600]   Oh, wait.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.320]   They moved it.
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:03.200]   It's on 5th Street now.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.080]   Yeah, it's on 5th and-- is this San Jacinto?
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:11.320]   5th and something La Fayette la lai.
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:15.000]   Brazos, Trinity, Southwest--
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:15.920]   Anyway, you can find it.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:17.240]   It's just down the street from Voodoo Donut.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:17.560]   You know what?
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.600]   We're going to have some donuts, too.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.160]   And you're right next to the Ohhenry Museum.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:21.920]   And the Hill Monster.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.160]   Oh, that's super close, actually.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.240]   That's really close.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.240]   OK.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.240]   OK.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.240]   Yeah, OK.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.240]   March.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.240]   What day did we say?
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.240]   March 9th?
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.240]   March 9th.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.240]   April 9th.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:34.240]   What day did we say?
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:35.240]   March.
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:36.240]   March 9th.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:37.240]   OK.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.240]   [SIGH]
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:42.240]   Blake says he's donning now his gay apparel.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.240]   Was it?
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.240]   In the chaterer.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.240]   Oh, I--
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:48.240]   Fifth and La Vaca.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.240]   La Vaca.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:50.240]   Oh, the cow.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.240]   The cow.
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:52.240]   La Vaca.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:00.400]   appearances, we actually do try to organize this show to happen around about 1.30 p.m. Pacific
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:04.440]   on Wednesdays for 30 Eastern 21.30 UTC.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:05.440]   Please stop by.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.440]   Join us.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:07.440]   Watch it live.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.440]   You can hear all the behind the scenes stuff.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:15.560]   You can also be in the chatroom at irc.twit.tv.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.560]   Somebody's--
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.080]   HT Editor says Stacy introduced Hatch, Chile to Leo and Jeff.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.800]   I think it is Hatch, Chile season.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.160]   So we can totally do that.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.160]   It's delicious.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.160]   And queso all around.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.440]   Oh, my gosh, guys.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.200]   I got a Google recipe for Mexican cheese dip.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.920]   And I was like, do they mean queso?
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:35.920]   And they did.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.200]   What else could it be?
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.840]   There was a great obit online this week where they said that he was not fancy and he refused
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.720]   to eat fancy foods like a camis.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:46.160]   So they just called it bean dip for him.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.160]   Garbanzo bean dip.
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:51.160]   Nothing fancy about hummus.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.160]   Is there breakfast queso in Cézí?
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:56.160]   Queso is in any time food.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.160]   Yes, it's an all day thing.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.160]   All day thing.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.160]   Like, queso is--
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.160]   Cézo is coming.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.160]   Are you coming to South By?
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:03.160]   No.
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:04.160]   [SIGHS]
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:08.160]   Well, Apoxia and you, Jeff, we could all have the show in the same place.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.160]   And it would have been an Austin.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:10.160]   I would have lured you in the orbit.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.160]   I know.
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.160]   It's so cool.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.160]   I love Austin.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.160]   I'm actually really glad I missed South By.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.160]   So I'm really excited about this.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.160]   We will do that next in a couple of months.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:25.160]   And meanwhile, we will adjourn this session of this week in Google.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:32.160]   You can watch On Demand Anytime at twit.tv/twig or subscribe in your favorite podcast appliance.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.160]   And let me not forget that we are still doing the survey.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.160]   It helps us.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.160]   Once a year we ask a little bit of our audience just some information about you.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:45.160]   Nothing we're going to use personally.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:50.160]   We aggregate all the results and no personal notification, no leaks of your email address.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:52.160]   They would be kept private.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:54.160]   It's a twit.tv/survey.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.160]   Take about four minutes.
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.160]   We've shortened it up quite a bit.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:01.160]   It helps us understand you better and also helps us explain to advertisers why they should
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:03.160]   support this show.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:09.160]   So a very, very nice thing that you would be doing for us if you would go to twit.tv/survey.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.160]   And I thank you in advance.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.160]   Here it is.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.160]   I'll do it now.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.160]   Breakfast queso fun dido from Chowhound.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:23.160]   Can you smell what Stacy's cooking?
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.160]   I'm not too clear.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.160]   I am not making queso fun dido.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:29.160]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:30.160]   We'll see you next week.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.160]   Twig, on that note, I'm out of here.
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:43.160]   [Music]
