[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Matthew Ingram is here from fortune.com.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Great to have you, Matthew, from above the 49th Parable.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, nice to have you.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Also here from ours, Technica, Ron Amadio.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Hello, Ron.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hey.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Great to have you.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Jeff Jarvis has the week off.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   He's in Mexico City and could not get a good connection, unfortunately, at his hotel.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   But that's okay.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I love these guys.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And of course, there's lots to talk about.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Google I/O is next week.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Ron, you're going right?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I can't wait.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We got hotels booked and plane tickets and meetings and all that.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It could be awesome.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.400]   You know, I hope you didn't book a hotel in San Francisco because you should probably
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.000]   know that the Shoreline Amphitheater is considerably south of here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.720]   Yeah, we're close to it, but on the wrong side of the 12 lane highways.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   So you can't walk.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.960]   You can't definitely need a car, yeah.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.080]   Google I/O is next week.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.360]   In fact, our show will be delayed next week because we're going to do coverage of the
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.080]   Google I/O Wednesday keynote starting at 10 AM Pacific.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.760]   That's 1 PM Eastern times 1700 UTC.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.360]   No, that's not right.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.800]   10 AM is, yeah, 1700 UTC.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.120]   The keynote will take place not in the traditional Moscone Center or even inside a venue at Google.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.280]   It will take place at what is a place mostly known for outdoor concerts.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.360]   The Shoreline Amphitheater.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440]   That's where Neil Young has his bridge benefit every year.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.160]   But it is in Google's backyard.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.800]   Have they told us how this is going to work?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   There's a map for Google I/O and they're just kind of going to fill the parking lot with
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.880]   all sorts of, I guess, tents and event spaces.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   I don't know.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600]   I guess it's going to be like a little tent city, which will be weird.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   And I'm going to bring sunscreen.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   Well, yeah, it'll be warm.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   It'll be nice.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   You're not going, Matthew.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   No, no, I'm not, unfortunately.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   I'd love to.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.440]   I think Google I/O is fun.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.000]   You know, it's ostensibly a developer conference, but Google has so many irons in the fire.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.760]   It's not, by the way, Ron, is it alphabet I/O?
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.640]   No, it's still Google I/O.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.600]   I don't think any of the alphabet companies are going to join in on any of that.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.160]   It's Google show and it's going to be nah.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   Okay.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   Okay, that's interesting.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   There, come on though.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.440]   They're going to show some Google X stuff I would imagine.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.840]   Yeah, Google X is the only group that's ever kind of really participated in I/O.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.240]   Everybody else is just steered clear of it.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   Are you guys sent in anybody?
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.840]   You bet Jason Howell will be there.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.760]   Father Robert Ballis there will be there.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.960]   Jeff Jarvis will be there and we will, of course, being in the keynote doesn't help us
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.080]   cover it in any way.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.480]   So I'll be sitting here with our team watching the keynote.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.000]   They're going to stream it and doing our usual commentary.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.520]   But then what will happen is after the keynote ends, we're going to get these guys to kind
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.560]   of go somewhere and find a place where they can Skype so that we can have them join on
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   a twig.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.600]   So twig will be probably about 2 p.m. Pacific.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.040]   Be pushed back by everything.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   So what do we expect?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.480]   What's going to be the big story?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.720]   Every kind of weird reality thing you can think of, virtual reality, augmented reality,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.680]   that's pretty much what kind of takes up the schedule.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.880]   It's a weird show this year because usually the big deal is a new version of Android but
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   that already launched.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.600]   So Android in, we know about that.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   I'm kind of Android in.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.840]   Do you think they'll say anything about Chrome and Android?
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   Like a margin.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   Oh, God.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.240]   I have to think this is going to be where they're going to say we're going to put Android
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.920]   on Chrome OS, right?
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.880]   Yeah, there's a couple things they could do.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.080]   I mean, there's the rumor desktop operating system that we may or may not hear about.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:44.440]   There's getting Android apps on Chrome OS, which kind of works now, but there was code
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.760]   somebody found where it said Google Play was going to end up on Chrome OS.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.400]   So you get like the whole app store and be able to pick from whatever you want, which
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.360]   would be crazy because if that works, then it's because of the kind of technical underpinnings
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.200]   of it.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.800]   It would be very easy to make that work on Windows and Mac and Linux since it's just
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.080]   a Chrome extension.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.600]   So you'd have Google's app store on like all these desktop operating systems.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.160]   It would be super crazy.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.680]   So you're saying if Google went to the effort to put Android at the Play Store on a Chromebook,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.240]   they would as a benefit be able to put it on everything else that has Chrome on it.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.400]   Yeah, because you can do this right now.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.200]   You can run individual Android apps on Chrome OS and it all works through a project called
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   Arc.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   It's the app runtime for Chrome.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.440]   And this is built on the Chrome extension platform.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.840]   So it's not using any Chrome OS underpinnings.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   It's just using Chrome.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   Right.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.480]   Yeah, it's just a Chrome extension.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.320]   And because it's a Chrome extension, it works on Chrome OS and Windows and Mac and Linux.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.840]   And they've kind of been building the technical part of this for like four or five years.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   It's been called native client.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.880]   And now it seems like they're finally going to unleash the potential of this and have like
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.920]   this crazy, hostile ecosystem takeover.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.080]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.560]   That would be really interesting.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.000]   Maybe I picked the wrong time to put Linux on my Chromebook Pixel.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   Whoops.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.440]   I had kind of given up on the Chromebook Pixel.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.760]   I thought, well, there are other really now better and faster Chrome books out there that
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.200]   Dell and the HP and the Acer are all beautiful, all aluminum and less expensive.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.920]   So, and I'd been waiting for kind of something to happen with putting a Linux shell on Chrome
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   OS.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.760]   There's crouton, but that's not really very happy.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.960]   So I just put Debian on it.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960]   It actually works great.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.880]   There were a few things I had to do.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.000]   But that's so that's really interesting.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.080]   How about the Pixel C tablet?
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.360]   Will that go the other way?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   Well, that's an Android device that really could have been a Chrome OS device.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.320]   I mean, you're kind of seeing the beginnings of that in Android and where there's a split
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.040]   screen mode.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.200]   There's also a floating like multi window mode in Android that we found a bit ago.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.320]   So we'll probably hear about that.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.120]   That's not like officially released yet, but through the usual weird hacking, we were
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.320]   able to enable it.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.080]   So I don't know that that.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.320]   I mean, you're definitely going to see Android go the other way where you'll get more and
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.640]   more kind of desktop operating system features like a like a window system.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.520]   But the Pixel C doesn't have a mouse.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.680]   So you're kind of stuck with just split screen on that.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   It's really limited.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.040]   You wrote a great article on the Pixel C and how it was really an orphan product that
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.800]   was intended for other uses and they finally just pushed it out the door with not the right
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.640]   OS and it's kind of a mess.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.720]   Yeah, it's a weird product.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.440]   If they held it, if they held it past the release of Android and I think their reception
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.040]   for it would be a lot better because then you get split screen and it becomes a little
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.800]   more useful.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.880]   But yeah, it's just weird.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.760]   It was supposed to have Chrome OS and would make more sense with that, I think.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.000]   So this could be, frankly, I think Chrome OS is getting better and better and more and
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   more desirable.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.560]   Now that there are many, it's really interesting to see all these former Windows, or I guess
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:32.400]   continuing to be Windows OEMs, hedge their bets with Windows and make pretty darn nice
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.200]   Chrome OS devices in a broad range of prices.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.280]   Yeah, what was it?
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   That aluminum HP Chromebooks?
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   HP makes it beautiful.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   It's amazing.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.640]   Yeah, it's really nice looking.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   Acer also has an aluminum one.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.360]   Both HP, Dell and Acer all have what I've been wanting for a long time.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.000]   A lot of Chromebooks are the cheap $200 netbook-y kind of devices, very plastic-y, which is fine.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I mean, there's a market for that.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.160]   But I wanted to see something in the mid-range, the $500 to $600 range that was a nicer device,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.600]   not as expensive as the Pixel, which is really ridiculous.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.440]   Nobody's going to spend $200 on a Chromebook.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.360]   And I think now that there are, I think Dell, HP, Acer, ASUS, and Lenovo are all making
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.600]   very nice Chromebooks.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.440]   Samsung, too, I should throw them in.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   And of course, the thing that people don't like about Chromebooks is they feel foolishly,
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   I believe, feel they need a more complete operating system.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   They want more apps.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.480]   They want a file system.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.440]   All this stuff that they trust me they don't really want.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.000]   But a good way to do it would be to add Android, right?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.280]   Well then you're going to get a lot of phone apps, and it's not-- I don't know that it's
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   going to fix Chrome OS all that much.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.120]   I kind of feel like Google Play on Chrome OS is just kind of the safe test area where
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.680]   they launched this.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.960]   And the real target, I think, is Google Play on Windows and Mac OS.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.920]   I'm not interested.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.640]   It doesn't add a ton to Chrome OS.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.040]   I mean, like my personal problem with Chrome OS is you can't get a good photo editor.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.440]   And I want these big, powerful desktop apps, not little phone apps.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.320]   Well, but there's also an issue there because you don't have a lot of storage on Chrome OS.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.040]   None of the Chromebooks really come with more than 32 gigs of storage.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.560]   Yeah, you were saying your Pixel's what, $1,200 and has 32 gigs of storage?
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.440]   I mean, in every respect, it's an i7, it's 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.600]   It's a wonderful computer.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.200]   I love the keyboard.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.000]   The 32 touch screen is beautiful.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.560]   So in every respect, it's a great computer, but it doesn't have much storage because it's
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.400]   a Chromebook.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.480]   And God, if it had 64 gigs or better, 128 gigs, on the other hand, it's funny how spoiled
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.120]   we are because, I mean, Matthew, you and I are old enough to remember when PCs came
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.400]   with much smaller hot drives.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.200]   And we were fine.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.720]   Yeah, we were fine.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   I remember my first two gig hard drive.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.840]   I thought, oh, I'll never run out of space on this.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.680]   So 32 gigs, well, it doesn't sound like a lot.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.200]   And I mean, you can buy a USB, a 64 gig USB drive for 20 bucks.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.240]   This has an SD card slot, which a lot of Chromebooks don't.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.680]   So that means I could put a 200 gig SD card in there and there you go.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   There you go.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.680]   Storage, I need.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.880]   So I have to say, and you know, you think Ron, is it time for another pixel?
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.440]   Would they do you think they might show a new new Chromebook hardware?
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.680]   No, we would hear about it.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   I think Chromebook, Chromebook hardware ends up in the Chromium source repository.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   So it's not.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.000]   It's usually never a surprise.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.880]   You know, the guys that pay attention to this are like, there's a new board found in
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.720]   the thing and it'll be named after like a street fighter character or something.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.000]   And then everybody knows some kind of pixel is coming.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Right.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But there's none of that yet.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.120]   Maybe they're just happy enough that the other guys are doing them.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.680]   They don't need to do them anymore.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.960]   I just saw something about Google working on something similar to Amazon's Echo.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.000]   Oh, I'd love to see that.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   I mean, Google, it's baffled me with the Echo that Google and Apple.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.160]   And Microsoft have not done something similar.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.000]   The Echo is really kind of a unique device.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.400]   And so according to Rico, they're working on something that'll look sort of like the
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.840]   on hub wireless router and goes by the name Chirp.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.680]   That's the internal name.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.960]   Yeah, I've heard that before.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.160]   Yeah, I've heard somebody say Chirp before as their little voice appliance.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.960]   Yeah, it makes a ton of sense because Google already has all the parts and and the software.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.720]   And the nice thing about the Echo though is because it's because it's plugged in.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   The voice hot word is like a million times better than what you get on a smartphone because
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.640]   smartphones are always trying to fall asleep and save power.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.400]   And this thing when it has electricity, you can just have the mic on full blast all the
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   time.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   It's awesome.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.120]   And brilliantly done mics, the array mics are much better because they because they pick
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.280]   up every sound in the room.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.920]   In fact, we have an echo now one in the kit.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.520]   We have I've I don't know.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.520]   I've stopped counting.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.520]   I have a lot of echoes a bedroom living room kitchen.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.520]   Dan.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.880]   Anyway, I have I have one in the kitchen and I say, you know, Echo set timer for four minutes
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.800]   and it will respond and the one in the gym will respond.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.480]   I mean, it's pretty far away.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.400]   And and so they're they really are good in that respect.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.720]   It's kind of funny to have dueling echoes.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.040]   So that's part of it.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.960]   Now, didn't the on hub?
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   It doesn't have a microphone.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.640]   It did have a speaker.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.760]   You did not like the or underwhelmed by the on hub runner.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.080]   In fact, I didn't buy it because of you.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.080]   Yeah, good.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.080]   Good call.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.640]   The on still sucks.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.440]   There's still none of that ever actually happened like it was supposed to be a smart home device
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:02.160]   and and has all these sensors in it or has all these antennas in it that are dormant and
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.440]   are supposed to work.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.920]   But no, it still doesn't work.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.480]   The USB port still doesn't work.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.000]   Bluetooth still doesn't work.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.760]   The one thing they added was this than that.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   Right.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.240]   And so you get smart home stuff through somebody else's ecosystem.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.840]   Yeah, not Google actually doing what what they promised they were going to do.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   So yeah, it's it's a huge bummer.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.000]   It seems like a real missed opportunity.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.960]   I mean, when I saw it, I thought, Oh, that's great.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.760]   Could be a smart home hub.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.520]   No, Google's got lots of services that could integrate with that.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.880]   The actual story about the the shirt comes from Jessica lessons.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.920]   The information read Albergotti reporting.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.040]   And apparently there are four Nest Google products under wraps.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   One is called Flintstone by just for the name.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:59.040]   Note, imagine a tech company naming a product after America's Stone Age family.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.640]   I like the the nickname for that because the engineers think it's never going to come
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   out.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   So they nicknamed it tombstone.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.880]   Oh, well, Nest has been working on it for three years.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.040]   So maybe not.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.000]   That's a wireless hub in the brains of a nest security system.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.040]   I can guarantee you it's dead now after the reports.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.720]   We talked about it yesterday on security now that Zigbee has a terrible idea for security
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.760]   system because you can jam it.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.400]   Anybody with a $2 jam or just walks in the door and the security system doesn't know
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.600]   they're there and it's just there.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   So I don't know.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.320]   What gets me what gets me about Alexa is you can you can say like, you know, Alexa unlock
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.840]   the doors or something and it'll do it.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.520]   And it's like, what if someone's just outside the house and shouts it really loud.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.040]   Yeah, this is a bad idea.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.800]   I mean, we need to rethink the idea of security systems being tied to this infrastructure.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.480]   Security system should be secure.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.760]   Seems to me they're also working on something called Pina, which is a wireless security
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.360]   sensor fancier though than the existing stuff.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:14.040]   Both of these will use thread, which is the Internet of Things OS or communications protocol.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   I should say.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.800]   Yeah, it's like a Wi-Fi replacement kind of thing.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:26.280]   And then Keshe, not Kesha, Keshe.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.320]   These are Bluetooth mobile Bluetooth tags kind of like the tracker.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   Also using thread could operate like a smart key fob.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:42.280]   Again, I really worry about wireless systems that unlock doors.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.800]   And then finally, this chirp thing.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   But Nest is a a disaster.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:54.720]   So anything you hear about future Nest products coming out, don't hold your breath.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.440]   Because I mean, these guys have been inside Alphabet for, I don't know what is it, a couple
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   years now and have released no new products.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.200]   They bought Dropcam and rebranded it.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.680]   And that's kind of been there.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.320]   They got all this money from Alphabet and have done not a whole lot with it.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.400]   It's just there's been stories on the.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:20.440]   The recode piece said that originally Nest was going to work on this thing that was sort
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   of like that.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440]   They rebuffed.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.840]   And then Google's like, that's not happening.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.280]   This is from the information Google is working on a device to compete directly with Amazon's
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   popular Echo voice control personal assistant portable speaker.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   Nest wanted to be part of the project within Google, but was rebuffed by the person in
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.120]   charge of Google's project.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.360]   Google already plays technology like the Echo and the Android, of course.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.320]   You know what I just got and I really like, I should have done a review of it yet is the
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.880]   echo dot.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.280]   So this is the little, it's tiny part, just like the top part of the echo.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   It's got a little speaker, but you really, it's not intended to use, be used as a speaker.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.920]   It's just the array mics and the smarts of the echo.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.200]   And then you pair it or connect it physically to whatever speakers you want.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.360]   And that was always my one knock on the echo was it didn't have a great speaker in it.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.240]   So it's fine for audible books, but it wasn't great for music.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.320]   And now I have a hooked up to a very nice speaker system and I'm happy.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.600]   I'm loving it.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:26.160]   So for me, the reason I'm looking forward to a Google voice appliance thing is that my
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.000]   problem with the echo was that the ecosystem around it really wasn't great.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.040]   Like everything wanted to be locked into the Alexa app.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.880]   Like you say, you know, make a add this to my shopping list and it sticks it inside the
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.720]   Alexa app and you make it to do thing and that goes in the Alexa app.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.160]   Like I want you to use the apps that I prefer on my smartphone and on the internet and all
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160]   that.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.720]   Like I don't want to live my life inside of your one app because that's like what most
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.240]   of the Alexa functions go to and you can't change them.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.320]   And it's a huge bummer.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.480]   It's the same reason I haven't been in it that interested is exactly that.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.000]   I'd much rather have something that that moved across different platforms and ecosystems.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.280]   You can make appointments on your Google calendar now though, they just added that.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   So there's that.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.520]   There's that.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.640]   I think the thing that's interesting with the echo is the skills.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.160]   It's fairly easy to write skills.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.600]   So it isn't that, I mean, echo is extensible to work with any app.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   All the app developers do have to write an echo skill.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   What's a skill?
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.880]   So it's very easy to write these Amazon provides the infrastructure.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.440]   You use Amazon zone servers.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.800]   You can write one for free and or you can pay per transaction.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.360]   And it's a very simple thing to add a skill to the echo.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.200]   And the problem with it is it's kind of a silo.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.240]   So you have to know and there are hundreds of skills now.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   You have to go to the Alexa app, search for the right skill and add it.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   You have to enable it.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.520]   And then you have to remember that you did it.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.200]   So it's like there if this then that it's very extensible though.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.240]   I mean, yeah, it's an API.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.720]   It's a great API.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.160]   So there's no reason why you couldn't, you know, if you're a calendar app, for instance,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.920]   have an echo skill that would work.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.560]   You know, I play Jeopardy with my echo.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.600]   I say echo ask, you know, let's play Jeopardy.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.480]   And it gives me six Jeopardy questions.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's tied to the Jeopardy app.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.040]   It even does a plug for the Jeopardy app.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.240]   It says that's cool.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.040]   So I feel like it's an open ecosystem.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.960]   But that's it's difficult to manage at this point because the vocabulary is all over the
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   place.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.560]   It's very hard to know what your echo can or cannot do.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.000]   But the echo is like a good year old, I think, and I tried it a few weeks ago and it's there's
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.640]   still that skill ecosystem never turned into being able to do what I want with it.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.640]   Really.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.600]   It's still it's just not very popular with developers, I would guess.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's easy to write.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.240]   So if you're, you know, if you're Python, Pythonista, it's not hard.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.040]   There's 87 pages there of skills.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.520]   You can use it to pull your Tesla out of the garage, apparently.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.080]   You can somebody autos.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.320]   So Tesla has a summit feature, which makes me extremely nervous.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.120]   You'd also have to tie it to your garage door opener.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.800]   But I'm sure you could do that with if this than that.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.200]   And the proper garage door equipage.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.360]   And you could the car would pull out of the garage without a driver in there.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   It does it very slowly.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.280]   So it's not to run into anything.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   I hope so.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.440]   You'll only be slowly run over by your vehicle.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.520]   Why do you say something someone used summon and smash the car up, I think?
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   Yeah, you can't.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.720]   So you're relying on the Tesla's sensors to know to see everything.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.000]   And it's always been the case that they don't see everything.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.640]   It even says that in the manual very clearly, you know, don't trust these sensors.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.680]   So summon, it's more of a nice.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.880]   Yeah, this guy in Utah's car crashed into a park trailer.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   Nice.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.360]   At a very low rate of speed, probably, like two miles an hour.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.160]   But you know, you hit something with a two ton car.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.240]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.720]   There you go.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   See how slow it is?
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.400]   This is a video of it parking.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   That is slow.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.520]   No, it really is is inching in there.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.800]   And that makes you feel a little bit better.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.000]   That's because it has to see all the stuff and no one to stop.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   No one to stop.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   No one to stop.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   I guess it's going all the way.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   So Tesla, it's interesting.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.640]   They have so much detail in the driver logs.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.000]   In this case, they're quoting from the logs.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.080]   Oh, yeah, by the way, show that some someone was initiated by a double press of the gear
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   selector stock button.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   Yeah, you don't own those logs.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   No, no, of course.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.240]   Driver was alerted with an audible chime and a pop up message.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   And ignored it.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   Right.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   Ignored the cancel.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   Wow.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.040]   They did change how someone worked to make it market.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.440]   Was it dead man's switch?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.880]   Yeah, no, they know a lot.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.680]   Break pedal was released two seconds later.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.040]   The driver exited the vehicle three seconds after that.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.680]   The driver's door was closed.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.280]   Three seconds later, someone activated, pursued the driver's double press activation request.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.280]   Wow.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.920]   Amazing.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:29.680]   You broke all the rules and Elon doesn't mind telling you the warnings were not heated.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.160]   Six seconds later, driver puts his arm out the window.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   Waves to a power.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.760]   That's good though.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:42.560]   They knew the ambulance chasers would be after they had any kind of car auto driving stuff.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.520]   So, yeah.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.760]   I have a Tesla and order is going to come in the fall model X and which one?
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:00.520]   And I think that you just that's the price you pay to be a Tesla owner is that Elon is
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   always watching.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.160]   And I will be you probably won't hear me do a lot of talking about this thing.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.960]   I don't want to get in trouble.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.360]   He'll take it back.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.160]   He'll take it back.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160]   Here's your check.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.160]   Give me the car.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   You refuse someone.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   He did.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   Someone criticized it.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   Stewart House.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   Great tech reporter old friend.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.720]   No, you can't have a tough one.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.760]   He was bitching because he went to the event.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   Oh, right.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   Right.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.760]   And he had to wait three hours.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.040]   Didn't see the car.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:38.280]   And he and he blogged about it on medium and he answered fine.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.560]   No, Tesla for you.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.120]   Fine.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.600]   And so I really want one is you have to really want one.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:54.200]   And I really want one and I'm willing to surrender all privileges to own one.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   Everything.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.720]   Everything.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.400]   You can log everything I'm doing.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.440]   What else Google I owe?
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.480]   So you really think they're going to be all in on VR and AR.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.800]   They have a big investment in leap motion, right?
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   Or magically.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   Oh, sleep.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   No, magically.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   We've motion.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.400]   No, you need to worry about it.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.360]   We're not going to say anything for magically.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.560]   No, the big deal is going to be Project Tango, which is they're going to have the first consumer
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.520]   project Tango device built by Lenovo.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.840]   So this is going to be a smartphone with a bunch of sensors on the back, kind of like
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:36.760]   a Microsoft connect where it'll have it'll be like 3D computer vision.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.640]   So you'll be able to take it and like pan it around a room and it'll scan the room and
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.960]   give you kind of a 3D model of it.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:50.040]   And they want to use this for stuff like gaming where, you know, there could be little gnomes
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:56.920]   running around on the floor and you could kind of lower your phone and zoom into whatever
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.720]   is happening in the virtual world or precise indoor mapping.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.120]   So when you can 3D scan a room, you know exactly where you are in the room.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:13.200]   So, you know, Google could Google Maps could take you from, you know, the door of the airport
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.120]   into the airport over to your flight gate.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.800]   This never felt like a consumer product to me.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.640]   I could see why you'd wanted if you had a business and you wanted to have a floor plan
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.200]   in the Google Maps.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.040]   But why would consumer, what is the consumer side of this?
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.400]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.840]   I mean, it would be, I guess like a gaming console.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:40.360]   It's not a VR, I mean, or an AR headset, it would be a part of it of an overall AR experience,
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.920]   but they don't have the rest of the parts, right?
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.360]   They just map the room.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.120]   There's no gnome part.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   Or is there?
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   Maybe they'll show you.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   There's no, there's no headset.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.640]   I mean, but it would still be augmented reality just through kind of an LCD screen.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.240]   Like you, you wouldn't attach it to your face or anything, but that still counts as augmented
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.840]   reality where you kind of, you scan a room and like place people in it or, or, you know,
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.800]   characters in 3D.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.000]   And I mean, people who have been using them as robot heads since it kind of has all that,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.080]   scanning stuff and has a.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.760]   Yeah, no, I can see how you, so that's what it feels like to me, something you might use
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.320]   for something else.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.320]   Yeah, I don't, I don't get the consumer pitch.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.760]   I mean, with, with all of this crazy camera gear and 3D processing and all that, the battery
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.240]   life has got to be like horrible.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.000]   You wouldn't want to use it as a day to day.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.520]   There's a tango tablets out for a while.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.320]   And I think it's a specialty, it's a specialty product, I think.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.480]   Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't get it.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   I mean, yeah, here's for sales in a house.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.080]   Yeah, great for that.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.600]   Yeah, there's like a Lowe's app where you can like visualize the dishwasher in your, your
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   house.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.760]   And you, I mean, I don't think a real, there aren't that many realtors out there who are
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.320]   going to actually do this.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.280]   Maybe if it's a Sotheby's $8 million home, went on line catalog.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.920]   Yeah, but I mean, as the first ever consumer version, that's, that's kind of their job
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   to give us the sales.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   Right.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   So who knows?
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.520]   I just, I feel like if you care that much, you're going to go see the house.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.320]   I mean, okay, this is, yeah.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   All right.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.640]   Apparently they're going to do an Android, a standalone Android VR headset.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.960]   This is not cardboard.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.320]   Peter Rojas tweeted that Android VR will launch as a dedicated standalone handset.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:38.900]   Yeah, that's a weird report because Android is an operating system.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:44.000]   So they wouldn't call the hardware Android VR, but he, he says, yeah, that some kind
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.640]   of hardware is going to launch it.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   It can't be called Android.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.240]   Sounds like a gear though.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.880]   Unless it's, unless, so right now if you have cardboard or gear, you have to have a phone
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.120]   that you insert in the thing.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.680]   So the cardboard's cheap because as a holder is all it is with some lenses.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:05.400]   But of course, if you didn't have a phone or you didn't have appropriate phone, I guess
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.920]   if you would spend a few hundred bucks, you could have cardboard with a built in with built
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   in hardware.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   Yes.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:19.000]   So the full, the full collection of rumors is that they're going to have a gear VR competitor
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.560]   and then they're going to make a standalone headset with the processor and screen and
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.680]   all that in it.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.280]   And so they're going to have an Android version of a version of Android built for virtual
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:37.840]   reality, which I think would be the most important part because all of these, you know, there's
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.160]   already a million headsets out there.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.840]   The gear VR already exists, but Android built for virtual reality would be like the first
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.200]   ever VR operating system.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.880]   Like, you know, there's lots of people have vibes and Oculus riffs and all that stuff,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.360]   but all they do on them is play games.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.560]   Nobody's really tried a.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:02.240]   Like menu systems and email and all this stuff in in 3D virtual reality all over the place,
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.680]   which sounds super interesting.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:11.080]   I would also imagine we'll see some Android TV stuff or no.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.920]   Android Wear.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.920]   Nothing.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.360]   There's been nothing serious for Android TV.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.760]   I don't think they've been talking to the FCC about getting access to cable boxes so
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.640]   that you wouldn't have to get a cable box from your cable company and could buy one with
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   maybe Android TV on it or something.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.240]   It has been a very long time since we've heard anything from the Android Wear people.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.680]   There's no rumors or anything, but it's been like a year maybe since they had a serious
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.440]   operating system upgrade.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.200]   And all the watches are pretty old.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.520]   So yeah, that's a good bet.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.520]   Or not.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.840]   Or it died.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.520]   I remember, I mean, Android TV started to feel like Google TV, which just kind of
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520]   died on the vine.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   Are you a fan?
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520]   It was too bad.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.240]   Well, I wanted to be a fan.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:05.000]   I mean, I was looking for basically an alternative to Apple TV and I thought, "Jesus,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.400]   Android TV works good," or Google TV.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.720]   Just nothing has ever seemed to...
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   I mean, you can get...
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   I have the shield.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   The Nvidia Shield.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   You like it?
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.840]   Except that, I mean, it's just unrealized potential.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.280]   It's huge unrealized potential.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:28.360]   It should be better than the Amazon Fire TV or the Apple TV, except nobody's doing anything.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.360]   It's very disappointing.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.600]   Is anybody doing anything with any of the TV platforms though?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.600]   I mean, it's all just kind of...
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   They're all moving slowly.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   You can play Netflix on this.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.920]   Yeah, they're all moving fairly slowly.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.800]   I think everybody is hoping and waiting for an over-the-top solution.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.760]   We're waiting for the FCC in the US anyway, for the FCC to mandate an open standard to
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   set-top boxes.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.960]   Right now, you have to get it from the cable company.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:58.240]   Or as I do, I use a Tivo and then the cable company has to give you a cable card, but
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   we...
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.920]   The FCC has proposed rules that would require an open set-top box system.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.400]   It sounds like that's coming.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   So I imagine everyone waiting.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.920]   I feel like I pour a bunch of money into it if the whole landscape is going to shift
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   soon.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   Right.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.360]   And of course, the other side of that equation is getting the cable companies and the networks,
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.960]   which are sometimes the same thing, at least in the case of Comcast and NBC, to give us
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.560]   some sort of over-the-top experience.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.000]   Or Apple's been trying for years to do this.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.920]   The rumor was that...
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.760]   Who was the latest one that was about to make a deal?
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   YouTube on plug.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.160]   Yeah, YouTube on plug.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   Well, I wrote about that.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   I don't know if...
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:47.360]   I'm sure Ron has thoughts as well, but we've heard how long has Google been talking about?
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   Right.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.760]   Since 2012, as far as I can remember, Apple's been talking about it since 2009.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.960]   And it just never seems to happen.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.320]   And what it feels to me at least, like one of the sticking points is every time these
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.760]   guys get together, Google and Apple say, "So here's what we want.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.560]   We want all your stuff, all the best channels.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.880]   And here's the price we want, because we want to basically offer it for like $30 a month
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.200]   or less."
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:21.240]   And then all of the cable, all the TV providers and content companies are like, "Well, that's
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:27.120]   not going to happen because we want you to pay us X amount for this channel and X amount.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.440]   For that channel, I'm pretty soon.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.960]   It's $75 a month."
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.560]   And so then they just say, "Well, let's talk again."
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   That's the problem.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.120]   They're not getting a hard no.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.320]   If they're getting a hard no, if they say, "You nuts get out of here.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   Get out.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   Get out."
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   But they're not.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.000]   Well, it's an interesting idea.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.360]   We maybe, I like that idea.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.120]   Let's see if we can, let's crunch those numbers so on.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   Right, exactly.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.440]   So they go away so Disney and CBS and Viacom and everything.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.840]   They don't want to say a hard no, because I think they're terrified.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840]   Well, they are.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   They know that they're in trouble.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840]   Yeah, they know they're in trouble.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.040]   And they're losing sort of power by the day.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   And so part of them wants to cut a deal.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   They haven't hit bottom yet.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.840]   They just can't stomach the price.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.360]   They just can't, because the finance guys are like, "Are you joking?
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.880]   We can't give up to how much Google for that?"
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:25.920]   Well, if put yourself in the position of an NBC or a Comcast for the better, everybody
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.640]   under 25, nobody under 25 watches TV.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.440]   They watch YouTube.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.040]   So they see this train hurtling down the track at them, but they're playing a game
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   of chicken.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.880]   I'm not going to jump.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.360]   I can get another year out.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.640]   It's like the music industry that kind of do the same thing.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   It's very similar.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.360]   And they can't, so the same way the music industry tried to charge exactly the same
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:55.840]   for digital files as they did for CDs to sort of prop up the CD business, cable companies
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.520]   and TV providers want exactly the same amount of money from Apple and Google or more as
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.480]   they charge out all the satellite and cable guys.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.960]   Meanwhile, what Comcast has been doing is a filling a backfill operation where they slowly
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.880]   increase the cost of internet.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   Right.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   Because they want to--
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.200]   So cable companies get to do that.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.360]   They get to hose you on cable as well.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.160]   Although, they can't do caps.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   That's one interesting feature of-- so the FCC has basically said caps are bandwidth caps
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   are not kosher.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   Right.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   Not officially.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.280]   Well, it's an anti-competitive because if you're Comcast, you really don't want people
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.360]   to be watching HBO now because you don't get any money for that because that's coming
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.360]   in over the internet.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:48.400]   You want them to be watching HBO on the television because you get paid monthly for that.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   So--
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   But they see it coming.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   They know it's coming.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400]   No, they know it's coming.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.080]   And they're all making these sort of side deals.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:05.000]   So Disney will kind of deal with Sling TV and kind of deal with Sony for the PlayStation
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   View.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.720]   But Apple and Google are so huge.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.760]   They're not-- like, Sling TV is still a relatively small thing.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.440]   But if you suddenly cut some cozy deal with Google or Apple, all hell's going to break
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.440]   loose.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   The record industry, the guys, the guy in the white pants from a capital is calling the
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.560]   guy at the NBC Universal saying, hey, we did this deal with Apple and you saw what happened.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.840]   It was terrible iTunes and it ate us alive.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   So stay away.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   Those guys should still kill you.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.880]   They shaded just a small computer company.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.440]   They're not a small computer company.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.400]   I've got to kill you.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.600]   Take it from me.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.240]   I'm on my fifth heart attack.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   I think if--
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.160]   Do you know if Apple works for the music industry?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.760]   I think if this FCC thing does take off and they kind of open up cable boxes, then I think
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:01.800]   Android TV gets a lot better since everybody needs a DVR anyway for TV.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.520]   So you might as well get one with Android TV on it and has all these apps and can run
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.560]   Netflix and all that.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.480]   But right now, having it as a standalone box is kind of like--
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   I don't ever launch it.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   I don't ever launch it.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480]   It's got so much potential.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   I hardly ever launch it.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   I just--
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.680]   But just imagine, if you did have a set-top box that was open in some way--
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.680]   Oh, man.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.360]   Like even the crappiest version of an Android box that you can buy from some guy off Craigslist
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:33.880]   who set up all the channels for you or whatever is 10 times better than your cable box.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   Absolutely.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   Okay.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.680]   These cable boxes are horrible.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.080]   I'm slowly replacing Comcast's top of the line product, the X1, which they really are
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.520]   selling as like a digital solution.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.840]   It's so-- just got awful that I'm slowly replacing them with T-vos.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.040]   But T-vos are not a great solution either because they're incredibly expensive.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.840]   If you buy the T-vos, then you have to buy the subscription and it ends up being very
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.120]   pricey alternative.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.960]   And you still have to rent a cable card from Comcast so they get you anyway.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.360]   But then they really screw you.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.880]   This is the thing that gets me.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:16.560]   So T-vos has HBO go on it, but you can't sign up through Comcast because they block
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   it.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.320]   They did that to Roku for a long time.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.760]   They did that to-- Roku only recently could you use your-- if you're a Comcast customer,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.680]   could you use HBO go?
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   You have to-- but you know, it's just--
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:35.000]   it's tough to be a court cutter, but the problem is what's going to happen is we still want
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.800]   to see our shows.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.720]   The younger generation they have--
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   They don't care.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.720]   They don't care.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.920]   You got nothing I want so see ya.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.080]   I got my laptop or my tablet and that's fine with me, my phone.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   We're having fun.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.120]   Ronamadio is here for Mars Technica.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.080]   He's going to be a Google I/O next week.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.280]   We'll check in with you.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   Find out how much of this came true.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   You're going to be doing lots of coverage.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   Okay, get to hold my feet to the fire.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.680]   Ron, you didn't tell us about the parachuting nanobots?
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   What are you?
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.400]   Not paying attention?
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.960]   Also Matthew Ingram from Fortune.com, he doesn't have to worry about that kind of stuff.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.800]   He's a big thinker.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.360]   Don't get--
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.600]   Mediums, I was thinking.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   Mediums.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.400]   Don't ever get in the prognostication business.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.080]   You can't say no win.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.200]   No win.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.760]   The show today brought you-- we got a new sponsor.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   I love these guys.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   Ministry of Supply.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.640]   I was telling you before the show, I didn't even know they were going to be a sponsor.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.960]   I went out and bought some great stuff.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:43.440]   My new shorts, Ministry of Supply, they make stuff that's for people like us that's long
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.120]   lasting smart clothing.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.640]   They do things like if you were going to rethink clothing, let's-- so for instance,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:59.120]   shorts instead of having buttons have these little snap things and this great, there's
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.360]   so much better than buttons.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.600]   They're faster and easier to use and they hold on better.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.320]   I got some Ministry of Supply clothes here.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320]   I just love it.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.120]   Go to Ministryof Supply.com/Twig.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.280]   You'll get 15% off your first purchase with the code.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.000]   Twig, I also got a travel jacket from them.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.160]   The whole idea is it's stylish, good looking, long wearing clothes for smart people.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:32.360]   The stuff is business clothes that are engineered by MIT-trained engineers to provide technical
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.360]   things.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.080]   Body temperature regulation keeps you from getting too hot or too cold.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.240]   Moisture wicking fibers.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   They're stretched by-- I love these shows are the shorts I got.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.760]   Best shorts I've ever had.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.320]   Incredible.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.480]   Some Gemini Chinos.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:54.800]   This is a classic twill chino but they re-engineered it using face change materials from NASA.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.400]   It stores and releases body heat based on the surrounding climate.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.600]   It's cotton with these face change materials built in and the fibers are stretchy so you
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.440]   can bend and sit without any restriction.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.360]   It's clothes like you want to wear that if you thought, oh, I think we can reinvent clothing.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   This is it Ministry of Supply.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.840]   Oh, this is a nice shirt.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.440]   There's a shirt for you.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.440]   Nice collar.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.640]   They are stylish, right?
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.840]   It's really a work wardrobe workhorse.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.360]   The material wicks sweat from your skin with laser cut, ventilation underarms to keep the
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.360]   air flow going.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.960]   Stretchy material allows great movement.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.720]   The brushed interior feels different on the inside than it does on the outside.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.720]   It's really soft.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   Here's the archive.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.040]   This is the archive shirt.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.640]   All of their clothes are easy to maintain, wrinkle resistant.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.800]   That's one of the reasons I got them because they're wash and dry.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   Great for traveling.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.400]   You never need to iron them.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   They're great for geeks.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   Look at that.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.240]   I mean, look good.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.240]   They really do.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.480]   Ministry of Supply.com/Twig, 15% of your first purchase.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.480]   They also have stores Boston, San Francisco, Washington, DC is opening too.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.360]   If you go to the store, just mention Twig and you get 15% in the store too.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.080]   This is smarter men's wear straight out of MIT.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.240]   Finally, somebody's designing clothes by us for us.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.800]   Ministry of Supply.com/Twig.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.160]   Oh, this is a mercury SVK sweater.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.800]   So it's Marana wool, but also has this PCM infused acrylic.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   And let's get this.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:35.880]   This is 28% carbonized coffee infused nylon.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:42.480]   It doesn't smell like coffee, but the coffee infusion reduces odors.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.360]   What?
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.360]   This is awesome stuff.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.320]   Yeah, it doesn't smell like coffee, but it's beautifully soft and nice.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.600]   Oh, I'm going to wear this right now.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.960]   Sorry, you're going to lose your sample.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   This is mine.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.960]   I'm taking it.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.960]   Ministry of Supply.com/Twig.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.360]   Oh, that's nice though.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.080]   So nice.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.160]   I'm taking four geeks by geeks.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.560]   Matthew Ingram is here from Fortune.com.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.680]   Mr. Rana Madio from Mars Technica.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:21.880]   Today, Day 2, Oracle versus Google, the Smackdown in downtown.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.560]   This is the trial that never will end, of course.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:33.000]   And I remember talking to James Gosling, the inventor of Java a few weeks ago on triangulation.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.640]   And he says, "So, son invented Java."
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.280]   James Gosling was his son when he invented Java.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.720]   And then of course, Google went to son and said, "We'd like to license Java.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.200]   We'd like to use Java for Android."
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.440]   Actually, it wasn't even Google at the time.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.480]   I think it was Andy Rubin at Android.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.000]   Google later acquired them.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.200]   And for whatever reason, they didn't end up licensing it.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:02.360]   They created an equivalent, a JVM called Dalvik, right?
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.640]   And now they're using art.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:13.280]   But Dalvik is API identical to Java.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.120]   Now I have to say Gosling said, "Well, we looked at the Dalvik code and it was our
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.960]   opinion at son that they had actually copied some of the code.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.560]   This was our code we saw in there."
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.240]   So he said, "Google slimed us, but not to the point where we were going to sue him.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.240]   We didn't want to sue Google.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.560]   So we just left it."
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:36.200]   But he says, "During the conversations between Oracle and Sun during the acquisition talks,
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:42.080]   he says the Oracle lawyers' eyes lit up when we started talking about Java.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.640]   They knew there was something there.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.120]   And Oracle was perfectly willing to go after Google.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.600]   And in fact, they did.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.160]   They sued saying, and this is the interesting thing, and this is where Gosling said it.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.600]   This is where I think there was some merit in this.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:03.000]   But their lawyers, the Oracle lawyers, determined that we're not going to get them on the stealing
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   code service.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.840]   Two arcane, no jury will get it.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:11.640]   We're going to get them on the APIs are copy-writable.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.160]   They stole the API.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   Now by the way, there'd be no PC industry.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:22.520]   If Compaq couldn't copy IBM's BIOS API in a claim room environment, they didn't steal
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   the code.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.680]   They just made it functionally equivalent.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.440]   There would be no PC industry for that.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.680]   It hadn't happened if that had been illegal.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.240]   Initially, this was thrown out.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.760]   The court, and even the appeals court said, "No, but somehow this has gotten back into
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   trial.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.360]   Now they're having a jury trial."
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:42.160]   And Oracle's suing for $9 billion.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:51.880]   They're suing Google, saying Google's use of Java APIs violates copyright law.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:47:00.000]   Former son CEO, the final CEO, the last guy, the man who sold son to Oracle testified today,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.120]   took the stand today.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.520]   Was the Java language created by son in the '90s free and open to use?
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.360]   The Google lawyer asked?
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:15.240]   "Absolutely, yes," Jonathan Swartz said, "since its inception long before I arrived
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.640]   its son."
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.320]   It was in our interest to promote the use of Java everywhere.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.120]   If you were using Java, then everything else son sold, we could sell it to you.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.240]   If you're using Windows, which was the dominant, or was the dominant operating system, we had
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.040]   nothing to sell you.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   Swartz said that freedom extended the use of Java APIs as well.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.760]   See, I don't think Swartz was real happy with Larry Ellison and Oracle.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.640]   No one's happy with Larry Ellison.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   Who is?
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:48.240]   The strategy is, this is Swartz talking.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:54.480]   We agree on these open APIs, then we compete on implementation.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:05.400]   That's the whole idea of copyright ability for APIs and using copyright law to pursue
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.560]   people who use an API.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.320]   I think that the implications of that are disturbing.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   It's messed up.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:18.720]   They win, it's a very bad thing.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.000]   Swartz says the strategy was, we agree, okay, the open strategy sometimes led to things Swartz
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.200]   doesn't like, like the GNU class path project, an open source Java product that the son was
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.440]   forced to compete with.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   Did they take a license?
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   Asked Google's lawyer?
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.640]   No, absolutely not, Swartz answered.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.840]   I was annoyed, but it was completely consistent with our practices.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:44.520]   When you say APIs are open, they're going to be competitive implementations.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.560]   Apache Harmony.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.400]   He says there was nothing we could do about it.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.660]   Swartz, when he was CEO, had discussions with Eric Schmidt about a possible partnership
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.560]   in the mobile space, son was looking for Google to promote the brand to endorse Java and endorse
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   that logo.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.120]   That would mean a lot of other companies would want to pick up son products.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.000]   It would make son more relevant in the marketplace.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.760]   They didn't make a deal, I think it was a combination of money and technical independence,
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   Swartz.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.320]   Google didn't want to rely on anyone else.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.720]   Yeah, it sounds more like that to me.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.520]   Son, I also just like to do their own stuff.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   Part of the big difference at the time was that Google needed to strip down everything
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.000]   to get this to run on a smartphone.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Because I mean smartphones back then were unbelievably slow.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.400]   It wasn't just the Java APIs.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.360]   They had to hack and slash away at everything that was unnecessary in order to get some kind
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.800]   of working operating system up on this.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.000]   At the time, it seemed like they were doing everything above board.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.160]   They did a clean room implementation of the APIs and the CEO of son posted a congratulatory
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.360]   blog post when the Google deal was announced.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.960]   Now Oracle comes along and says, "Oh, well, we own this now and we're going to do the crap
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   out of you."
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.960]   Which is totally Oracle.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   It's so Oracle.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.760]   Yeah, it's so Oracle.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:17.560]   Okay, so apparently Swartz is testifying for Google, even though he was the son CEO.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:23.600]   Now Oracle's lawyer gets cross-examination.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.240]   He asks, "You didn't want to work for Oracle, did you?"
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   Swartz, "No, I did not."
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.520]   Oracle didn't offer you any senior management position, did they?
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.520]   No.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.920]   By the way, I should really point out, this is a jury trial.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.200]   So you've got 12 people who have no freaking clue what an API is.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   Guarantee you.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:46.120]   In fact, there was only one person with any development or technology experience and Oracle
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.600]   got him off the jury.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:54.040]   So these are 12 people who know nothing off the street.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.760]   So they don't know anything about technology.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.680]   They don't know anything about APIs.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   They don't know anything about probably about copyright law either.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.680]   Right.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:08.240]   So these are 12 of your peers.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.600]   Oracle didn't offer you a position, did they?
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   No, I resigned.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.480]   Was Oracle frustrated at your guidance?
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.440]   Oracle was frustrated with the speed at which customers began abandoning sun.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.800]   Once it became clear, we were going to be acquired by Oracle.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:27.440]   So they're trying to basically say, "Oh, Swartz, you hate Oracle and that's why you're testifying
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   against us."
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.480]   And of course, this is not about technology.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.520]   This has nothing to do with APIs and whether they should be copyrightable because the jury
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.360]   won't understand that in that way.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:45.320]   It's about $9 billion in damages.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.160]   I don't, you know, who cares if Google has to pay $9 billion?
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.720]   That's not what worries me.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.560]   What worries me is there's precedent that APIs are copyright.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.320]   It's the principal.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.360]   Bad idea.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:04.160]   And even James Gosling said that would be a terrible, terrible precedent to set.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.160]   Well, we'll follow.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.360]   This is going to continue on, okay?
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:17.120]   Our guy in the courtroom, our guy in the courtroom Joe has been crazy.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.560]   He posted, I think like four or five stories.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:24.160]   Yeah, this is Joe's, by the way, I should have given Joe Mullen credit here.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.920]   This is his, this is from his transcript at Ars Technica.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.760]   He's done a great job on this, by the way.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   At the end, it says, but this, in fact, highly recommend you just follow Joe and Ars Technica
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.360]   and just read these articles because this is fascinating stuff and very important.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:46.520]   So finally, in the midst of the greatest recession, you were one of the bottom 10 CEOs in the
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:52.800]   country, according to the employees, says Oracle's lawyer, worst 10, 15 worst CEOs in
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   American issues.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.480]   And short says, in the midst of the greatest recession of my lifetime, a lot of people
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   were upset.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.320]   I was upset too.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:08.040]   Anyway, this is good.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   Highly recommend it.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:14.440]   And it's an important trial, not because of $9 billion, but because of the precedent it
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.440]   might set.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.960]   And unfortunately, the Supreme Court has already ruled that API use doesn't, can't
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.960]   fall under fair use.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   Right.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   So you can't claim.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.360]   So that's kind of, and that was related to this.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.520]   So what happened was that Oracle lost in the appeals court.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:33.600]   So they took it to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court didn't rule on it.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.200]   They just turned it back.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   And that's why we're having a jury trial now.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:42.320]   By the way, only 10 people on the jury, not 12.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.920]   Sorry.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.040]   How long is this supposed to go on?
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.360]   Do you know, Ron, how long will Joe be stuck in there?
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.360]   No idea.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.360]   I don't know if he knows really.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.080]   I have no idea.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.080]   All of this court stuff, it just goes on forever and ever and there's appeals and more appeals.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   And I don't know.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.680]   I let Joe take care of all that stuff.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.600]   Well, I think this one is kind of interesting.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:15.560]   And of course, this would be a terrible, terrible precedent to set.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:21.320]   We'll continue to follow it with interest, not because of Google, but as much as just
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.880]   because this is something to affect everything.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.360]   It's like the Feinstein Burr encryption bill, which would effectively make browsers illegal.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:34.400]   Just a little thing, not a big deal.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.960]   Or actually, we'd make SSL illegal.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.880]   I guess you could still have a browser who couldn't have a secure browser.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.040]   That couldn't-- there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.640]   That couldn't have any consequences.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.320]   People should be able to bank without security.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.320]   No problem.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:55.080]   What else?
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.720]   We did Chirp.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.360]   We did Nest.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.360]   What is going on at Nest Run?
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.720]   Are they going to just fold their tent eventually?
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.320]   It seems like a train wreck.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.520]   I had Nest thermostats installed.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.240]   When we moved it and bothered reinstalling them, I was like, "Eh."
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.320]   I even owned them.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   And this was like, "Eh."
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.960]   It really bummed me out when I got one.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:23.400]   But they a couple, maybe months ago, they finally added GPS via your cell phone to turn
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.880]   the heater on and off.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.880]   Oh, it'd be good.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.440]   So as you get closer, you could--
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.080]   Before it was this one little sensor in the hallway or something, and whenever somebody
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.160]   walks by, it would trip it.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.440]   But now, the app actually uses your phone to know where you are and whether someone's
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.160]   in your house and turns on and off that way.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.160]   And that works a lot better.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.080]   But yeah, I mean, it's just a thermostat, whatever.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:54.120]   The interesting thing I had heard about Nest is that it was like a recode report, I think,
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.040]   where they were kind of on like a three-year funding plan at Alphabet.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.240]   And that three-year funding plan is about to run out.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:07.240]   And I think they get to pick like if they're going to just spin off Nest and say, "Good
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   bye.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   Have fun."
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.240]   Oh, they could leave Alphabet?
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.240]   Or Alphabet would--
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.440]   They could get kicked out.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.680]   They could get kicked out of the Alphabet club.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   I guess.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.840]   I mean, Alphabet is a-- you know, as a company full of companies, some of these companies
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.600]   are going to fail.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.800]   And we don't know what happens when that happens.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.600]   So that will be an interesting thing to see.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.120]   I don't know.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.960]   Google has banned payday loan advertisements.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.440]   Thank goodness on its AdSense platform.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.040]   It's about time.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.640]   It seems the rules aren't too draconian.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:52.400]   If your interest rate is 36% or more, or you have to pay back in fewer than two months,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.280]   we're not going to do ads for you.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   I think that's fair.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   Do you think so?
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.080]   I don't know.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   No, I'm--
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.080]   You're serious?
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.400]   Well, I'm concerned about--
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   I mean--
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   You don't--
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.880]   I don't like payday loans.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   OK, this is interesting.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.520]   No, I see what you're saying.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.520]   But Google--
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.520]   They're not illegal.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.520]   Right.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.520]   They're not illegal.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:22.600]   So if they were illegal, then obviously Google should not provide advertising for them.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:29.000]   But if they're legal and people are choosing to use those services for whatever reason,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.880]   why should Google not allow them to do that?
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.880]   Very interesting.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:37.520]   It feels a little bit like, you know, sort of escort ads and those sorts of things.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.640]   Those sorts of those things are not technically illegal.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:48.080]   Authorities have been trying to get lots of services to not include them to not.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:55.200]   But if it's a legal service, you know, if I'm for whatever reason decide to use that,
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.360]   why shouldn't I be allowed to see ads for that and then choose to do it?
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   It's a slippery--
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   I see what you're saying.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.280]   And now I'm coming around to your point of view.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:10.880]   Because it's a slippery slope because this is now Google not merely enforcing the law,
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.520]   but making policy decisions.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   Right.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.680]   And so I think it's fine if we all agree the payday loans are shady.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   And so we're fine with that.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.680]   Make them illegal if they're bad.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.560]   But, you know, it's like first they came for the payday loan ads and then they came
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   for the thing that I actually like.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.560]   Right.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.800]   Well, related to this, the rumor-- and I don't know if it's true.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:39.440]   And Facebook denies it that their editorial team were-- these temporary curators at Facebook
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.960]   hired were blocking some conservative content from Facebook.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   It's interesting.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:50.080]   First they denied it and then they said, "We're looking into it."
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:55.360]   So those two things are mutually incompatible.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   Right.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.520]   Either it didn't happen or you're looking into it.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:06.240]   So-- and I feel like, you know, definitely there's some pressure the Senate wants to talk
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.840]   to Facebook about it.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.200]   They don't actually have-- the interesting thing is the Senate, you know, sent a letter
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:16.400]   and they don't actually-- they don't have any right to tell Facebook what to do with
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.400]   its trending topics.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.400]   Right.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.640]   Al Franken is always sending letters out to it, right?
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:28.360]   Jeff Roberts wrote for us about the first amendment and how it applies to, you know, algorithms
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:32.240]   and various other methods through which you do things that applies to both Google and
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Facebook.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.600]   So it's not as though the Senate can say, you know, "Here's how you have to run your
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   trending topics."
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:44.760]   But for me, the real issue is everyone got obsessed with the human beings fiddling with
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.080]   things and trending topics.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:52.040]   The thing that I find interesting is the algorithm that runs the newsfeed, which routinely chooses
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.440]   to highlight certain things and not highlight other things.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:59.680]   Those are all effectively editorial decisions that Facebook is making.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.800]   And you and I have no clue why they make them.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.400]   They claim that it's just to serve you and show you things you like.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.040]   But there are some very real implications around that in terms of people's consumption
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:19.360]   of the news, the things they see Facebook chooses to hide, you know, news about Syria
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.080]   or news about attacks on black people or whatever.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.560]   And so you don't see them because you spend a lot of time on Facebook and it's one of
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:35.280]   your main sources of news that has some very, very, I think, fundamental implications for
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.040]   sort of society in general.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.640]   How do we, and Facebook, my big problem is Facebook kind of pretends that that doesn't
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.720]   happen.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.880]   So they say, "Well, it's an algorithm and it just does what you want."
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.880]   The end.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.880]   That's sort of their standard response.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.400]   This is kind of the problem Google's had though too, right?
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:56.080]   Google's also algorithmically generated.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.880]   But algorithms are people.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880]   They're made of people.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880]   It's like a seedling green, right?
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880]   Yeah, it's made of people.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.800]   And so human beings tinker with the algorithm.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.000]   And if what you have is a lot of, and I'm not saying this specifically about Facebook,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.240]   but if what you have is a lot of sort of 20-something white guys from Silicon Valley running your
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:21.920]   algorithm, it's going to make certain decisions that may or may not be appropriate.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.800]   Tom Stakey, go ahead.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:30.080]   Google Search kind of ends up having the same problem a bit because they personalize your
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.040]   results all the time based on your history and what you've clicked on in the past.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.880]   And if you go on Google Search, there's like a little man and a little world button.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.000]   And if you click on the world button, it will turn off the personalization.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.120]   But it kind of ends up building like a bubble around your search results where you, it only
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.680]   shows you or it has a bias to show you things you've read in the past.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.600]   So it will block out kind of alternative viewpoints, which is weird.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:04.800]   But it's good for some stuff because I can type in almost anything and it will be related
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.840]   to Android because of my search habits and research and all that.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:14.080]   But if you're searching for political stuff or whatever, it's weird and kind of unwanted.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.880]   It's actually a little more of an issue with Google.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.960]   It's easy to adjust the Facebook algorithm.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.480]   I just ended up following all the candidates, Republican and Democratic for president.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.560]   And that really helped create a more broad feed.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.800]   In fact, one of my friends said, what are you following?
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.640]   You liked Donald Trump on Facebook?
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.080]   I said, yeah.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.200]   And so should you because if you don't want to ignore everything you disagree with, if
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.760]   you should disagree with them.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.360]   But lots of people do.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   But not everyone who they do have effort.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.960]   Yeah, they probably do it as well.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.280]   Filter bubbles were possible before too.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:59.480]   We all knew people who only watched one news program or only read one columnist in one
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.800]   right wing newspaper.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.600]   I'm married to the only Republican in Northern California.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.480]   I know about filter bubbles, baby.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.600]   With the liking Donald Trump thing, you have to read something first in order to disagree
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   with it.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   Right.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   So yeah, sure.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.840]   Click the like button because how else will you know if you hate something?
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.280]   And I follow the libertarian, Johnson and everything.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.120]   I mean, I think it's good to do that.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.920]   And it broadens you.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.680]   But people are going to, you know, a lot, I know a lot of people put their finger on
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.600]   both sides of put their finger in their ears when somebody says something from the other
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   side.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   That's not.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   But that's just human.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.080]   Yeah, thanks for the Google can't fix that.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:46.680]   I mean, Facebook has talked in the past about doing research into how the structure of the
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:53.000]   newsfeed affects people's political behavior affects the way they see the world affects,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.560]   you know, whether they vote, things like that.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.800]   There's a huge amount of power when you're as big and influential as Facebook is.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.840]   And I know, you know, journalists friends have said, well, newspapers and editors make
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.120]   editorial decisions about what to include in their version of the newsfeed, which is
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.720]   the webpage or the website or the newspaper.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.680]   But there, there is no newspaper that is as big as Facebook.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.520]   There is no newspaper on which, you know, 60% of millennials find most of their political
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   news.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520]   Right.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.240]   They're just simply has never been a media entity like that before.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.120]   I, you know, it's, I've been saying this for years about Google.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.600]   I say it now about Facebook because they both wield immense power.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:42.200]   And they are private corporations that aren't required to be balanced and fair in any way.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.640]   But they have, but I think there's a higher moral responsibility for both parties.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.600]   And the thing is they don't neither one of them is particular.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.360]   Google's gotten a lot better.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.520]   I mean, I think years of criticism of things like Google news has they've gotten a lot
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.280]   better. Facebook is still refusing to even have the discussion.
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.800]   So when all this stuff comes up, they just go silent or they come out with a statement
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.360]   that says, you know, the algorithm is this magical thing that chooses things based on
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.640]   your behavior and we're totally scrupulously fair and objective or whatever, which just
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.960]   simply can't be true.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:25.320]   So I would much rather they at least started having the discussions started saying, yes,
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.720]   we're right. We are a big media entity.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.320]   The things we do can have these huge social effects.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.000]   And so we should talk about that.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.680]   Tom Stocky, who is VP of search at Facebook, posted a couple of days ago, my team is responsible
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.680]   for trending topics.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:49.200]   And I want to address the reports about Facebook's contractors manipulating them.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.600]   By the way, they are anonymous reports in that, you know, right there.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:06:00.920]   And he writes a nice, I think, piece and I think it is true that Facebook understands
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.480]   this responsibility.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.320]   And I mean, at the very least, they don't want to be caught doing it.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.640]   I don't think they're tempted though.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.800]   I think that they understand that their business, he says our review finally says our review
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.280]   guidelines for trending topics are under constant review will continue to look for improvements.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.320]   We'll also keep looking into any questions about trending topics to ensure that people
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.600]   are matched, now this is where you might get into trouble, matched with the stories that
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.840]   are predicted to be the most interesting to them.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.400]   And to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective as possible.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.720]   Those seem like contradictory things.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.520]   See, those are totally opposite things.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   Right.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.720]   If it's neutral, then you can't match it to what someone might want to see.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720]   Right.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.040]   You might have a problem with that last sentence there.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.480]   It's a difficult thing to do.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.600]   But I think Facebook, I would not expect Facebook to in any way be trying to manipulate the
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]   feed.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   I mean, you can't imagine something.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.560]   No, and siding up to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   No, no, no.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.040]   Mark, what would it take for you to throw me to presidential?
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.200]   No, and I don't think they do that.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.400]   And I don't think they're deliberately mucking around in things to change people's opinions.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:14.040]   In fact, it came up at a Q&A, I think Facebook employees said, should we be doing something
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.720]   to stop Donald Trump?
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.720]   Right.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.760]   You know, everyone said, well, no, that's not what we would do.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.560]   And that's not part of what we're supposed to do.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:28.080]   My problem is that is that they will sort of accidentally do things that affect the way
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:33.840]   people vote or when they vote or who they vote for, how they see the world by pursuing
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.040]   their other interests.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.040]   Right.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040]   Right.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040]   So not deliberately.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040]   Right.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.200]   Sort of acts as a secondary effect.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.000]   So it's an interesting question.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Yes.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.560]   See, there's an article for Fortune written by a colleague of yours in Mount Facebook
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.160]   employees, Big Hillary Clinton donors.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.880]   But that's, but Facebook, you know, I wouldn't, that hasn't, that's neither here nor there.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:06.560]   I would hope that their politics would not intrude into their algorithm.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.400]   There is always the potential though for unconscious.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.840]   Well, and some people pointed out that things that, if you look at the things that were
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:19.960]   removed or that these anonymous sources said were removed from trending topics, it was
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.040]   garbage news reports from right wing news sites that have no basis in fact.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.520]   And so I guess it's a little like payday loans.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.320]   Those are the sort of political reporting version of payday loans.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   We can all agree.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.320]   Well, that's dumb.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.480]   You shouldn't include that because it's garbage.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.520]   But what about the next thing?
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   Right.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   I think it's a little bit more like a letter link that's slightly more credible.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.440]   He says it's garbage, right?
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   Right.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.240]   And yeah, but also the first report that was like Gizmodo or something, I think, said
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.280]   that they have tools to inject stories artificially into the trending topic thing, which is also
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.720]   crazy because you can influence stuff just as much as you can, you know, adding stuff
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   from removing it.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.840]   And they were also prevented from, it's a little like Twitter moments aren't allowed
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.320]   to be about Twitter.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.520]   So Facebook trending topics at one point were not allowed to be about Facebook.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.840]   Because then would only be about Twitter.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   It would all be Twitter.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.720]   It's a giant echo chamber.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.280]   The problem is there's very hard to watch dog something like this.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.680]   It's completely opaque, both Google search algorithm and Facebook's trending topics or
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680]   news algorithm.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.680]   They're completely open.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.440]   And I know there's been, you know, in Google's case, there's been lots of people trying to
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:40.480]   push for, you know, trying to make search neutrality the same as net neutrality and trying
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:48.720]   to force Google to basically publicize the algorithm and to, or to guarantee that they're
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.520]   not going to fiddle with the results.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.360]   I mean, nobody that I don't think would improve the problem or improve the situation.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.160]   It might actually make things worse.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:05.240]   And it's not that Google and Facebook, you know, part of the value they add is by, is
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.480]   through the selection process.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:13.960]   I just think there are implications beyond, beyond just, oh, my news feed sucks or my
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.920]   search results are terrible.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.480]   You know, their implications beyond just the results you're getting because it does determine
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.720]   those filter bubbles help shape your worldview to some extent.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:33.080]   We take you now to a Renaissance festival in central Russia where a drone is shooting
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:39.600]   imagery of the Knights and ladies and lords in a, in a combat scene.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.760]   That's a drone footage.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:47.280]   But notice one of the Knights takes Umbrage at this 20th century technology and herles
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.400]   takes the drone down the drone.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.360]   The drone is down the drone.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.360]   Really nice shot.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   Look at that.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.760]   Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.200]   And give that guy a prize.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.880]   So now we know.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.360]   Carry a spear at all times.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.880]   All right, we're going to take a break for guys who want a great shave experience at
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.200]   a fraction of the price you'd be paying at the drugstore.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.760]   Oh no, I no longer go to CVS to get my $8 blades.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.640]   I get better blades from Harry's.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.600]   You know why Harry's bought the company that makes the blades in Germany and they've been
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.760]   crafting them.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.280]   This company's been around for a century.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.760]   They've been crafted them and Harry's got them to make the best blades for the best
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.280]   price and they ship them directly to you.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.040]   So you don't have to get in line of the drugstore or wait for the clerk to unlock the
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.600]   plexigast case hiding those super high price blades.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.040]   No, no, a million guys have made the switch to Harry's.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.840]   Go to the website h a r r y s dot com slash twig and pick up a Harry's today.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.800]   I am a Winston lover.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.720]   I get the metal handled Winston case is a Truman kit.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.040]   The Truman, you know, Steve Gibson is a Truman guy.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.200]   He likes the kind of the soft touch grippy surface on the Truman.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.320]   They got all different colors too.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.920]   In every case, these kits come with three blades, your choice of the foaming shave gel
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.880]   or the shave cream.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.760]   It's shipped to your door and then you get the blades.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.400]   You get the subscription of the blades and the cream so you never run out.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.960]   I love it.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960]   I love it.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.840]   But we've got a Harry starter kit.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840]   You're going to like a lot.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:35.720]   This is at the Truman $15 to get the handle, the moisturizing shave cream, the three blades.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.200]   And when you go to Harry's dot com slash twig, they're going to take five bucks off that.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.200]   So that's $10 for all of that.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:47.120]   Oh, and don't forget the travel cover, which is a lovely, lovely thing.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.200]   I'm really a fan of Harry's.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.080]   I just, I just love everything they do.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.440]   And the subscription is nice because you always have a fresh blade.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.120]   So when it is date night, and you want to have an extra clean, close shave and a smooth
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.280]   cheek for your honey, go to Harry's.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280]  com/twig.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:13.080]   And don't forget to use our special offer to get $5 off the Truman kit.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   That makes it $10.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.400]   They have other stuff too.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.800]   Great gifts for grads at that time, isn't it?
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.880]   You got a graduate high school graduate.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   Get them a Harry subscription.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   It's the gift that keeps on shaving.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.080]   Samsung Galaxy Note leak from nine to five Google August 15th.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.320]   This is the new note, the six.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:36.280]   I have to say, I have tried all the Android competitors.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   I don't know what you use, Ron.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   I'll ask you in a second.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.760]   I've settled in the Galaxy S7 as my daily driver.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.040]   But I love the note, and I do like the stylists.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.760]   And maybe this one, I won't be able to put the stylists in backwards.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.520]   Because I broke my notes.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.520]   That video was awesome.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520]   Oh, man.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   Oops.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.520]   Oh, man.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.680]   Now what would be interesting, and this is the rumor, Type C connector.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   Hmm.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   Finally.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.520]   Now, I realized the reason they didn't do it on the Galaxy S7 was because they wanted
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.680]   to fit in the Gear VR, which uses a micro USB connector.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680]   Yep.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   So I guess that means we're getting a new Gear VR.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   Right.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.680]   Yep.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   I got the HTC 10.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   I want to be open.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.800]   I love HTC, and everybody was saying, "Oh, this is the best HTC in years."
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800]   And I'd agree with that.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.680]   You know what's nice now?
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.120]   Top of the line Android phones are all good.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.000]   I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with any of them.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.440]   This one does have a Type C connector, which I really am a fan of the Type C connector.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.240]   Unlike this S7, it's an IPS LCD screen, not an OLED screen.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.120]   I do like the OLED screen on the S7.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.920]   Let me unlock the S7 here.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920]   What do you use?
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.440]   I bet you're a 6P kind of guy, Ron, because you seem like a pure, pure guy.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.320]   Yeah, I always have some kind of Nexus phone.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.840]   My daily driver is actually the 5X because it's smaller.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   Right.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.600]   I definitely enjoy that size more, but I would love to have an aluminum version that would
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.600]   be super awesome.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.360]   That's one of the things I do like about this.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360]   This is nice.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.200]   Yeah, and I'm a big fan of the HTC 10.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.840]   They did a great job with that thing.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   I agree.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:17.680]   And especially from HTC, I never really expected anything that good, and it's really great.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.280]   I miss the front-facing speakers.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   They got rid of those, and now they have a tweeter and a woofer.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   And I don't get that.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.280]   That's kind of dopey.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.280]   The camera's good.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.000]   It's the 6P sensor.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.680]   They have the ZO-As is always are here.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.400]   I still think the S7 is a better sensor.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.760]   Battery life is better on the S7.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.920]   I do like a long battery, and the S7's really been the champ.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.200]   Although HTC 10 is no slouch.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   It gets through the day anyway.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.680]   It's just with a little bit less by the end of the day.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.800]   Yeah, the S7, it's a shame the version we got.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.240]   If you want to be a real connoisseur, you need to import the Exynos version, which is faster
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.200]   and has better battery life and just totally kills the battery in A20.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   Oh, interesting.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   It's a lot nicer.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.480]   Yeah, last year's S6 was Exynos.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.560]   But the Exynos, I didn't like the S6.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.400]   The Exynos couldn't keep up.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.960]   But the new Exynos probably is better.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.120]   Yes, it's way.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.640]   Benchmarks are better than the A20.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.200]   In our test, at least, the battery life was way better.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200]   Way better is big.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.680]   I always want better.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:31.680]   Well, I will also be very interested in the Note 6.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.680]   If it comes out August 15, that's a little earlier than last year, that would be good
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.120]   timing.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.960]   So if you can wait a few more months.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.720]   Yeah, I haven't seen that.
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:44.360]   Did it say they were changing anything or adding anything?
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.960]   Well, just the type C connector.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   That's big.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   Great.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.560]   No, it's Samsung.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.480]   They're not big on giant massive changes.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.840]   It's just they just keep.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.480]   When you got a winner, go with it, man.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.480]   Yeah, true.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.480]   They are winning.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.480]   So they're.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.440]   And also when you got a loser, go with it, right?
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.720]   They don't they go with it.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.760]   They've had a few losers in their time.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]   The S5.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.920]   What a terrible phone that was.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.320]   Let me see what nine to five.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.400]   This is a rumor, of course, it's a leak with nine to five.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.120]   I guess it'll have a nut roll on it and right in.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.480]   This comes from Evan Blass, F leaks.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.720]   So usually it's pretty good, right?
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.880]   I can guess it'll have a Snapdragon 820.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.600]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   Get ready.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:38.840]   5.8 inch display, bigger display and 4000 milliamp hour battery, biggest battery yet.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:45.360]   I'm liking that 12 megapixel camera micro SD slot is back as it was with the SD.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   7.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.120]   Also, a choice between Exynos and Snapdragon 823.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   What's the 823?
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   Whoa, what?
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.120]   What?
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.120]   That's not a real thing.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120]   Is that a typo?
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.120]   Is that a typo?
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.800]   Because the 820 is not, you know, what do you think about this, Ron?
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.480]   Because I've been saying this, and I think this is true.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.840]   I think all the Android flagship funds got screwed by the 810.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.320]   That would turned out to be a bum chip.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.680]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.840]   It was it was way too hot.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.840]   It throttled all the time.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.760]   And so ACC and others really suffered from that.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.480]   Yeah, we've had like a whole lost year of Android flagship.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.480]   Lost year.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.480]   That's right.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:25.360]   Because Qualcomm needed to rush it out the door in order to get that 64-bit tag.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.120]   So they grabbed ARM CPU cores off the shelf and just kind of shoved it into a chip and
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.120]   shoved it out the door.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.200]   And we're like, it's 64-bit.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.200]   We did it.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.400]   But this year they use they're back to using their own cores and things are a lot cooler
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.440]   and nicer and yeah, they're 820 to way better chip.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.680]   I don't know what the 823 is.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.920]   They also going to use the same.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:45.920]   Oh, no, it is.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.600]   There is an 823.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:52.320]   There is an 823 and it will be first in the note six.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   According to.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.420]   Yeah, this is the first.
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.680]   This is the first we've heard of this.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.360]   This is not like a for real thing anyone's heard of before.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.240]   So who knows what's going to be different.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.160]   What what what what up to three gigahertz?
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   Wow.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   Okay.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160]   Super duper fast.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:16.240]   Oh, I also will do it a slightly higher clocking on the Exynos in the S seven as well.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.680]   Mm.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.560]   So don't get too attached to your phone kids.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.160]   There's a new one every day.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:34.200]   Did you did you see that the feds are apparently said to be taking a second look at Google search
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:41.880]   is from Politico, not normally considered one of the big Google reporter outlets.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   But this is what they said.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.120]   They've got a good fed context.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:50.320]   They know what they're in DC FTC asking questions about whether Google has abused his dominance
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.360]   in the internet search market.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:58.560]   Apparently, they've been meeting with representatives of a major US company.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560]   Can you say?
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560]   No, it must be Bing.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:07.360]   Yeah, they said major and one of the young.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.640]   Yeah, obviously it's Bing.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.840]   And that's what really bugs me.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:16.320]   The same thing in the EU that the EU's actions against Google all came from complaints from
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   Microsoft.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:23.640]   Well, although in Europe, I think my sense is there's there's a much more receptive
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.320]   environment.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.920]   So Microsoft might be the one that was an easy night.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920]   Right.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:37.800]   So lots of countries, they feel Google is too dominant because they dominate the search
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:43.400]   market in lots of smaller European countries, even more so than some countries.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.800]   I think it's like 90%.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.120]   Yeah, even in France, yeah.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.320]   Whereas only 60 or 70% here because of Bing, I guess.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:59.160]   Well, that's in a way you could say Microsoft brought it on because it was the results in
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:05.880]   the EU that apparently stimulated this FTC second look.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:11.800]   But the FTC will not comment because agency investigations are non-public.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.080]   But apparently, according to the reports, they've been meeting with companies more than
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.800]   one concerning Google's dealings over Android as well.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   That's the other thing, the EU slapped Google for predatory practices with Android.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.400]   Yeah, and it's interesting.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:32.840]   I don't know what Ron, what you think of that, but the Android case, a bunch of it was about
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:40.640]   basically forcing people to take Google Play as part of the deal, which everyone compared
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.960]   to Microsoft forcing people to take the browser effectively.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.960]   Right.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   Very similar.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:52.560]   Well, the difference is that Windows is not open source and Android is.
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.600]   And if you don't want Google Play, you are free to go grab the Android source code and
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.880]   kind of make your own version and make your own app store.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.800]   And Amazon does that with the fire stuff.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   True.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.520]   Okay, but wait, but if you do that, true, and I agree with you, and I think Google's getting
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.400]   beat up for doing something that Apple doesn't get beat up for doing only because they have
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.920]   an open source version.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:20.080]   But one of the things Google does do is if you do make an AOSP open source version phone,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.280]   you can never use that company now as banned from doing a Google services version.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280]   That they could absolutely.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.160]   And that was one thing that you didn't like.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.120]   Yeah, that's probably the strongest thing.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:38.160]   And actually I've heard Amazon has a real hard time getting fire devices built because so
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.280]   many companies are under the Google Play contract.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.840]   They're just like, nope, we can't touch it.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.000]   We can't build that for you.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   We're sorry.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   So that's.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.880]   Yeah, it's really lame that they could definitely get get beat up for.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.960]   But you do have to, I have to give Google some cred for making an open source operating
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.920]   system, let it supporting it, keeping it up out there.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:02.480]   Well, in Europe had to bend over backwards even to, I mean, they had they described the
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.680]   claim so that it would only apply to Google.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:12.200]   So it was only applied to companies that have an open source operating system.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.200]   Right.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.080]   Well, there's only one of those.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.800]   You may remember in the previous investigation, the FTC did rule against Google, but it was
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.360]   a slap on the wrist, a very minor find and a few, you know, things that Google had to
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.760]   do going forward.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   In fact, some people complain, remember the Wall Street Journal?
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:33.440]   Also a hereditary enemy of Google wrote an article saying some FTC lawyers had argued
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.040]   for stronger sanctions.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.920]   So maybe they're back back at the table.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.920]   I don't know.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.400]   An investigation is not doesn't mean anything.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.120]   Just, it's just an investigation.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:52.600]   And I got to say, I feel like there's far more, if you want to go after a company for
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:59.440]   a dominant position in some growing and highly relevant market, you'd probably wind up going
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:05.200]   after Facebook before you would Google, not that search isn't still relevant, but it doesn't,
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.960]   you know, there's with apps and social services and people are finding things a lot in a lot
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.240]   different ways than a Google search box.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.440]   Love.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.120]   This is from recurve.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.720]   Urvazoff who is a superstar agent.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.680]   He's the guy who talks like Colombo by the way, do YouTube an open letter from Irv.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.040]   You have built a business that works really well for you and Google, but it doesn't work
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.000]   well for artists.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.640]   When the artist sends a takedown, it should be a stay down.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.120]   Nice.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.600]   Nice.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:53.320]   This is the, you know, the old mainstream music industry talking to the new new kid in town.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.720]   If music matters to YouTube, why not give musicians the same choice you give yourselves?
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.280]   Taylor Swift should be able to decide which of her songs are available for free and which
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   are part of a paid service.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.920]   Or she should be able to opt out of YouTube if you won't give her the choice, but artists
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.200]   can opt out of YouTube because of the DMCA.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.400]   The only way for an artist to keep a song off YouTube is for that artist to send YouTube.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.400]   But notice every time that song is uploaded by a different user, that is impossible.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.400]   Nope.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.400]   Nope.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.400]   Nope.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   Nope.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.640]   No, I'm saying it's totally wrong.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.720]   The content ID system that you fly is meaningless when used to continue to hide behind a safe
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.080]   harbor provisions of the DMCA.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.080]   That's why they're there.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.120]   The safe harbor provisions give YouTube a safe harbor.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:47.840]   Yeah, it's funny how I actually wrote something about who's the guy who runs the record record
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.320]   industry association.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   The RIA.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.520]   Who is it these days?
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.520]   Is it Ted?
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.520]   Anyway, Satan.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.520]   Satan.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.520]   Satan.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.520]   Yes.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520]   Satan.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.520]   Close.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.680]   So he was saying similar things about, and you know what they really want to do?
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680]   Michael Gondin.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.920]   They want to get rid of the DMCA and safe harbor altogether.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:07.920]   Right.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.440]   That's what that's what Azov is basically saying.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.440]   And radio if they could.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:16.840]   Like if they could, they would just go back and un-invent radio and the Compulse Realizance.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.840]   So it's not.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.240]   Kerry Sherman is the.
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.240]   Right.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:25.000]   They want to fight the last war, not this war.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.880]   Actually, it's two wars ago, I think.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.600]   I think they're fighting Korea.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.160]   It's the Korean conflict.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.360]   I don't know what these guys are complaining about.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.520]   I really think like content ID is pretty much the perfect system because you can upload
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.080]   a song to it and it will it will repeatedly automatically instantly slap down every video
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.680]   that contains that song or you can choose to monetize.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.960]   You can choose to totally take it down or choose to monetize it with your own ads.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.720]   It's a great compromise.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:07.600]   She Hank Green, the YouTube star and podcaster and author and for all I know he's in the
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.240]   circus as well.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:16.000]   He wrote a letter responding to Irving saying exactly what you just finished saying that
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.080]   yes, you can actually keep it up.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.080]   Or you can choose to monetize it.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.720]   The whole system is designed to do that.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.200]   It may not be perfect, but the fact that everybody hates it.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.960]   Public industry and content creators means it's probably a pretty successful compromise.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.880]   I think it does that job.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.040]   If there's a big problem with YouTube, it's false takedown.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040]   Right.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.040]   We get along.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.400]   There are companies that spend all their time forcing YouTube to take things down and
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.040]   they don't have the right to do that.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.680]   Speaking of YouTube, Amazon's launching a service for content creators.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.680]   Some say to compete with YouTube.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:56.640]   I don't think it is actually a direct competitor called Video Direct.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.520]   You don't think it's a direct competitor?
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.960]   No, and I'll tell you why.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.960]   We were looking at it.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   It'd be great for us.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.880]   There's three ways you can play on Video Direct.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.600]   One is you can put your content there for free and Amazon Prime members will be able
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.600]   to see it for free.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.880]   And YouTube has said they're going to put, I'm sorry, Amazon has said they're going to
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.600]   put a million bucks a month aside to distribute among the top 100 most subscribed to content
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.600]   providers.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.880]   So, there'll be some potential upside for you, but you'll get free distribution on a
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.720]   huge platform, Amazon Prime.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.160]   The second way is you could do a paid service.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:36.560]   They'll let you sell your shows right next to the shows from HBO and CBS and everybody
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.560]   else.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.000]   And the third way is more YouTube-like.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:47.400]   Amazon will put advertising on it and you'll share a 45 split in favor of Amazon revenue
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400]   from that advertising.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.720]   That's very much like YouTube, but here's why I say it's not probably for everybody.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.360]   A, we wouldn't be able to, we'd have to cut the ads out of our stuff.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.360]   Not a big deal.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.480]   We have some ad-free content, our highlights, reels and stuff.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.480]   We could put that up there.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.480]   What do you mean?
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   You can't have competitive ads?
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:06.480]   No.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.560]   And the second problem is you have to have closed captioning.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.200]   Oh, you do.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   Which is-
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.200]   I'm all four.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.200]   I'm not against closed captioning.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.200]   That's great.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:22.360]   And the only reason we don't do it is we're hideously expensive.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:27.440]   And they're not offering some sort of automated system like YouTube does.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   You'd have to pay for it.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.400]   At least when we went through the- as soon as I saw this yesterday, we went through-
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.320]   Lisa and I sat down and went through the terms of service.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:47.240]   So I wrote this up too and I said that it was a competitor for the professional side
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240]   of it.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.880]   That's who it's for.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.960]   If you actually go to the Amazon site and click the upload button, you have to make an
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.960]   account.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.080]   And to make this account, you need to have a company name.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:02.800]   And you need to connect a bank account to Amazon for direct deposit.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.880]   And you need to give them like a tax ID for tax information for all the money you're going
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.200]   to make.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.760]   So that cuts out the whole like viral cat video side of YouTube.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.760]   It's definitely not that.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.560]   And that's exactly my point.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.560]   Interesting.
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.960]   If you're a machinima or TYT networker, one of these like pro or semi-pro youtubers,
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.920]   then you could jump in on this.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920]   Right.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.560]   In fact, they've got one of their content partners is machinima.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.560]   Yep.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.280]   Oh yeah, I'm reading off the partner list.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.520]   But I, you know, and maybe they'll change the closed caption.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:43.160]   That may be just an ADA requirement that Amazon has to adhere to for some reason.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:46.480]   So maybe you could upload it to YouTube and get them to do the closed captioning and
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.200]   then they're closed captioning so bad.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200]   It's too cool.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.200]   It is.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.440]   That's, that's a disservice to deaf people.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.080]   That's just, you should know and should have to read those captions.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.680]   That's part of the part of the problem too is of course our content is technical and
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:04.760]   requires, you know, there'd be a lead time also.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.240]   So it's not great for news content because we'd have to send it off, get a closed caption,
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.240]   can then get it up there.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.080]   I must admit, I can't, I can't decide whether this is like,
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:18.240]   like someone at Amazon thought, you know, we do Kindle Direct Publishing.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.680]   Why don't we do something similar for, for video and we'll just see what happens.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:27.120]   Like I don't know if it's a kind of, let's throw it out there and see what happens or
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:32.640]   if they're actually going to invest some time and resources in it.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.440]   The thing that gets me is that I feel like the Amazon Prime video interface is horrible.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:42.920]   And now you're going to mix in all these kind of YouTube channels with,
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:45.560]   TV shows and movies and all this other stuff.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.040]   It's not, their interface is not ready for this, like at all.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.440]   Well, that's the other reason it's not a YouTube competitor.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.240]   YouTube really is optimized for browsing.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:01.680]   And it works great that way to watch this on a Roku or a Fire TV or my television smart
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:05.360]   TV software is not going to be as satisfying.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.320]   It feels almost like it's more of a Netflix competitor where they kind of want it to
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   be.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.000]   I mean, they certainly want Prime video to be.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   I think why not?
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.160]   Look, it's clear that if you're Amazon or Netflix or anybody in this space, you want
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:24.120]   to have as much content, original, exclusive content as you can.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:27.680]   And why not put it on there, except for that issue you raise, which is it makes you use
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.680]   interface on.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:36.640]   I actually wrote something, I can't remember if it was yesterday or the whole, the entire
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:46.320]   video market, whether it's long form or TV style shows or cable or YouTube videos or
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.320]   Facebook Live.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:53.940]   I mean, it's just a massive kind of, if you had a map, all the borders and boundaries
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.480]   that used to exist would be erased.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.600]   You know, there's, it's just a massive kind of redrawing of the landscape where everyone
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.640]   is effectively trying to compete with everyone else.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.520]   And Facebook Live now is not live.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.520]   Lots of companies are using it to upload archive stuff.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:18.920]   It's just, it's fascinating because it's so chaotic, you know, it's so, and literally
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:22.520]   everyone is competing with everyone else.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   Disney getting out of the video game business, I guess the infinity, I just bought the infinity
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   stuff.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.360]   We have it, we have the collectors item.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.960]   I know, I guess that's it.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.720]   Hey, leave it in the box.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.960]   Don't, don't open the box.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   Crap.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.080]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:47.640]   Your tips, your picks, your suggestions, anything you'd like to pass along to our vast
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:53.600]   viewing audience around a motto from ours, Technica from fortune.com.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.680]   Mr. Matthew Ingram, our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.480]   I know you're getting hungry, you're ready to eat.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.160]   It happens to me every day around this time.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.240]   And then I think, Oh crap, I don't have anything in the fridge.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.240]   I gotta go to the store.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.240]   I gotta plan a menu.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.560]   I gotta plan a meal, buy a home, cook it.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560]   It's just a pain.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.840]   Then I remember, Oh, wait a minute.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.200]   Today's Blue Apron day.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.360]   And I go, Yay.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:21.040]   I love seeing that Blue Apron box on the front step, refrigerated fresh ingredients and great
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.040]   stuff.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040]   You get to go to the Blue Apron website.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.480]   You can see this to every ingredient you need, even if it's like one scallion, it's all in
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.360]   there, little bottles of flavor things.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.680]   And it's so fun.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:34.160]   And then you can, even if you're not a cook, in fact, this really, you'll help
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.520]   you be a better cook.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.200]   You follow the ingredients, the recipe card.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.600]   There's videos on the site if you need some help.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.760]   You'll be using ingredients that are unique and wonderful.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.680]   Each meal costs about $10.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.640]   High quality ingredients never frozen.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.480]   Even the fish and meat is all refrigerated and fresh from local farms.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.640]   Step by step instructions.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.720]   Take about half an hour to 40 minutes to make.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.480]   Blue Apron delivers almost anywhere in the continental United States.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.360]   All their seafood is sourced sustainably.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.760]   The beef is raised humanely.
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.960]   The chickens are free range.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:09.960]   I mean, it's good stuff.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.480]   Pork is arranged naturally.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.080]   They use regenerative farming practices for the produce.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.920]   I mean, they're really getting great stuff.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.960]   And there's less waste just because they're shipping you exactly what you need for the
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.960]   recipe.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.880]   Cook meals like crispy cod and cabbage slaw tacos with pipita, pineapple and avocado salsa.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.760]   I want that tonight.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:31.800]   Or how about Middle Eastern chicken and chickpeas too with pitot croutons?
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.600]   See, you might not ever think of that, but you got all the ingredients.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.600]   You make it.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.600]   It's delicious.
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.600]   The house smells wonderful.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.440]   If it's date night, you're going to make a new friend.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.120]   They have family plans too with kid friendly ingredients.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.040]   It's a great way to get kids cooking.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.280]   And we're going to get you your first two meals free, free shipping even.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.040]   Go to blueapering.com/twit.
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.680]   You'll love how good it feels and tastes to create amazing home cooked meals.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.120]   It's a way it's really love.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.680]   It's cooking up love.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.280]   I'm not kidding.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.080]   Grilled brie cheese and strawberry jam sandwiches with a rootlet and walnut salad.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.800]   Okay, I'll take that right now.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.800]   Right now.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:19.040]   Go to blueapering.com/twit for your first two meals free.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.120]   Love them.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   Blueapering.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.720]   All right, going to wrap things up here.
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.960]   Matthew, got anything you want to plug or talk about or software you use, hardware you
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:31.960]   like?
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:37.880]   I'm so behind, you know, hardware and software wise, we could talk about, you know, Linux
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:38.880]   Mentor.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.280]   We were talking about that.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.400]   I mean, we were both saying how I do like mint.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.760]   I'm amazed that you use it.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.600]   You use Linux on the desktop in lieu of like Windows or Mac.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.600]   Yep.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   Yep.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.480]   I use it as well.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.880]   And I love Mac.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:37:02.760]   I just, at one point I decided to try and run Ubuntu and then I switched to Linux Mint.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.680]   But it's not that new or exciting.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.920]   I actually had a number because I thought Jeff's not here.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:08.920]   Give us a number.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:09.920]   I love it.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:18.080]   So I came across, since we were talking about YouTube, I came across a research report from
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.080]   Bernstein about YouTube.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:28.160]   And of course, it's hard to get sort of hard numbers out of YouTube about numbers of videos,
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.000]   you know, the size of the archive, that type of stuff.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:39.040]   So this analyst, I came up with his own estimates based on research that he did going through
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.800]   a bunch of different YouTube videos and extrapolating.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:49.520]   And his estimate is that as of this quarter, YouTube has about two billion videos corresponding
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:55.960]   to 12 billion minutes or 197 million hours of content.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   Wow.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:02.320]   I just like those numbers for, yeah, I really mind bogglingly large.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.400]   Seen a way that's Amazon doesn't want to do that, right?
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.400]   That's not what Amazon's trying to do.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   No.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.400]   And if even if you were to try to do that, you couldn't.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.840]   YouTube is so far ahead of you already.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:19.200]   You know, you could still have a half decent service, but you're not going to do that.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.280]   YouTube videos have been watched an estimated 39 trillion times.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.800]   Yeah, YouTube keeps a running stack page up and run.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.880]   I think all the time it's like YouTube.com/stats or something, or maybe it's in the press site
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:37.240]   where they just have you like every second 10 billion hours of YouTube videos is watched
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.240]   or something.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.240]   It's amazing.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.480]   And the numbers keep going up.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.480]   Wow.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.640]   Wow.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.400]   I want that site.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.400]   YouTube stats.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.760]   Maybe it's on the press site.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.400]   I would love to just have that up on the screen.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.720]   Yeah, just sort of the stats.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.000]   Here is in the press site.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:02.560]   It's YouTube.com/YT/Press/T statistics.html, but this doesn't look like it's real time.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.920]   I'd love a real time when you love to see that.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.840]   I would be moving so fast.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   Awesome.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.280]   Ron, something you want to plug?
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.520]   Something you like these days?
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.520]   You're excited about?
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.280]   Nobody knows about, but you?
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   I'm going to be a huge dork and recommend a Star Trek podcast.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.280]   Nice.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.280]   It started--
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.280]   It started--
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.280]   Star Wars.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.280]   --it's like 30 episodes in.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   So yeah, it's pretty new.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.800]   It's called The Greatest Generation.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.560]   And the tagline is a Star Trek podcast by two guys that are a little bit embarrassed to
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.200]   have a Star Trek podcast.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.360]   That's the kind of guy that's what it was and did.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:42.160]   No, it's not like the-- I'm sure there's super nerd stuff out there where they're really
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.160]   into it.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:48.840]   But this is just kind of two guys making fun of Star Trek and kind of revisiting it since
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:54.720]   like, if you're my age, you probably saw the next generation on TV when you were kind
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.280]   of a kid and a lot of the stuff went over your head.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:03.920]   And now they kind of go back and look at everything and are great at coming up with running
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.080]   jokes.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.800]   And now they've done the whole HD transfer to Blu-ray.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:13.800]   So stuff that looked fine on your TV back then.
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:19.240]   Now you look at it in HD and it's like, oh, that's definitely a piece of cardboard.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.760]   What's cool is they go-- it's an episode.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.800]   So are they watching together and talking about it?
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:30.520]   Or are you just-- or should you watch it first and then listen to the podcast?
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.520]   Yeah, I like to watch the--
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520]   While you're listening.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.120]   They go episode by episode, yeah.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.400]   I wouldn't recommend playing it that much since it's definitely crude humor.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.520]   Oh, yeah, I could tell from the title salon.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.800]   It makes me sad that you said watching the next generation when you were a kid.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.080]   I watched the original Star Trek when I was a kid.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.080]   Star Trek podcast.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.080]   Two guys who are a little bit embarrassed to have a Star Trek podcast.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.040]   Oh, they got the nice NPR sound.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.040]   They got the nice NPR sound.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.040]   That's good.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.040]   Yeah, yeah, they put it on that a lot too.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.920]   Yeah, they sound like an NPR podcast about Star Trek.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.560]   It's very funny though.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560]   It's been pretty awesome.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   And there are only 30 episodes in, so they started episode one and worked their way up.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.600]   They just got through the horrible season one where everything's made out of cardboard
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.120]   and season one was a hot mess.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:23.400]   But it's getting good now.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.720]   I have three numbers as well.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.960]   One comes from our chatroom, Korean Corn Cops says, "Beauty Pies total views on YouTube.
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.480]   Total views, 12 billion, 47 million, 988, 3037."
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.640]   Oh, make that 38.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.280]   Oh, make that 39.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.880]   12 billion PewDiePie views.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.360]   He's been seen more than all the sitcoms combined.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360]   Of all time.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.360]   Of all time.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.360]   Wow.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.840]   It's just mind boggling.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.400]   Of course, it's the same 58 kids watching it a billion times each.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:01.280]   Well, and of course, TV folks will say you can't compare a YouTube video to.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.280]   Of course not.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   A Nielsen TV video.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.720]   Of course you can.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:09.720]   And I agree with them as an old time media guy.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:10.720]   Damn it.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.080]   Here's another number, $268 million.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:19.640]   That's how much the Japanese satellite cost that was destroyed by a software update.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   What?
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:25.320]   The Japanese X-ray telescope Hitomi has been declared lost.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.720]   It disintegrated in orbit, torn apart while spinning out of control.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:35.240]   TV analysis points to bad data in a software package, pushed shortly after an instrument
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:37.560]   probe was extended from the rear of the satellite.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.560]   Oops.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.120]   So they bricked it in a crash?
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.880]   They bricked it in a crashed.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.880]   Wow.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.120]   Kids, don't root your satellite.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.120]   Wow.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.960]   While it's in space.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.680]   Don't run as root on your satellite.
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.680]   Never.
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.680]   Yes, Matt.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.240]   Matthew Ingram.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.240]   Yes.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.920]   And finally, it was a Windows update.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:57.920]   It really was.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.160]   It was a Windows update.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:04.280]   It was a Windows 10 upgrade.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.080]   The most expensive Windows 10 upgrade.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.160]   And here's another number two million, no, 218,000.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.280]   The all time Donkey Kong record broken.
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   West Copeland.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.640]   Actually, I'm sorry.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.760]   It's 1 million, 218,000.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.680]   Actually, you're missing the one because no one, they never, when they designed Donkey
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:26.280]   Kong, so I'm going to go to seven digits.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:29.960]   One point two million and he played for how long straight?
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.560]   I think 36 hours, something like that.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:33.560]   Wow.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.880]   Wait a minute, no, I can't be right.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:44.840]   But he has been the Donkey Kong champion for a long time.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:53.680]   If you saw the documentary, "The King of Kong," a fistful of corners in 2007, the pair who
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.520]   held the record in that show are now 18th and 19th.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:02.120]   So apparently in the intervening nine years, there have been a lot of people, a lot of people
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.120]   working on this.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.920]   It's an all new record.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.040]   He did it on May 5th.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.520]   Trying to find how long he played for.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.000]   I don't think he was that long actually.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.160]   Oh, the thing that's amazing, he never died.
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.080]   It was all with the same character.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.640]   He didn't lose a single Mario in the game.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.640]   One quarter?
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:25.120]   Well, one quarter, obviously.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:31.200]   The record has to be one quarter, but he didn't even lose a life.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.200]   He's going to retire.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.200]   He said, "That's it.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.200]   You can't get any better than that.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.920]   This is the record that will never be broken."
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.000]   My last record score.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000]   I can put up a game any higher than this, says West Copeland.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000]   He's the king.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this episode.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.520]   I love it that the one is missing because nobody ever thought anyone would get anything
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520]   like that.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.040]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.040]   Was he wearing headphones?
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:06.440]   Do you have to listen to that stupid music over and over and over and over and over and
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.480]   over and over and over and over?
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.000]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.080]   Matthew Ingram Fortune.com always a pleasure.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.520]   Look at the bright side, the lake, the ice is melting and the lake will soon be ready
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:18.520]   for you.
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:19.520]   I hope so.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.520]   I hope so.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.560]   What can only help?
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.560]   Good to have you as always.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.520]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:29.040]   Are you wearing sandals with socks today?
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.080]   I always imagine you wearing sandals with socks.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.440]   I don't even know if you ever do that.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.440]   I try not to do that.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:37.120]   I sort of have a thing about socks and sandals.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.120]   Good.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.120]   Good.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.160]   But you are wearing a laughing squid t-shirt, so that's good.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.560]   I sure am.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.640]   That's always a good thing.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.800]   And thank you, Ronna.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:49.600]   I love having you on the show, ourstechnica.com.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.040]   What are you working on?
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.040]   Google I/O stuff.
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.840]   Wall to wall all day.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.280]   Yeah, it starts next week.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.520]   Things are going to get crazy.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.640]   And enjoy the way ourstechnica looks today.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.640]   Oh no.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.760]   Should be gone very soon.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.160]   It is a little, I mean, this is, it's classic.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.520]   I mean, it's a classic look.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.200]   I'm going to miss it.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:18.160]   So redesigns happen and so stage and that'll be fun.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.480]   And yeah, flying out, what, Tuesday?
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.480]   Good.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.480]   So that'll be cool.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.480]   And I'll have to track down Jason and everybody else.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.480]   Yeah, yeah.
