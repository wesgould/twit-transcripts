[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   photography
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.240]   Well, first of all big day today in our nation's capital. It was inauguration day. We have a new president
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.200]   a new historic vice president
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.960]   Uh, pretty darn exciting all around
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.520]   Get these
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.680]   The Donalds gone the Donalds gone
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.080]   He kind of slunk off but before he left
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   He did pardon 150 people
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.400]   Including
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   Anthony leven dowsky
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.440]   Google angle see we can turn anything into a google story because google controls the world
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.560]   And because you can always say and i looked it up on google leven dowsky still owes like 146 million dollars
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.840]   So that that doesn't get erased right i guess you can't pardon that
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.000]   No, you can only pardon for criminal not civil so you have you have judgments against you you can't
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.760]   Erase them he was a google engineer served anytime it has no no because of covet
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.720]   It was a covet
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.240]   He was a google engineer who was accused and convicted of stealing secrets from google and bringing them to uber
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:55.840]   Uh, he got an 18 month prison sentence on a one count of stealing trade secrets one count of a number of counts
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.000]   Um, the full pardon means he will avoid a prison cell
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   Uh, he
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   Didn't go to prison yet because they could wait till covet 19 was over
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.320]   Yeah, it doesn't void his judge and pray tell why would donald trump care about anthony lewendowsky
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.120]   well
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.480]   So
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.560]   We don't know because they don't when they when they released this and i read through the oh we do too
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   We don't know for sure
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.960]   Because i read through the you know the stuff and they you know say he
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.760]   mr. Levendowsky here's here's the pardon
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.560]   quote they mentioned the
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.480]   Sponsors and then say mr. lennavindowsky is an american entrepreneur who led google's effort to create self-driving technology
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.280]   mr
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.120]   Levendowsky pled guilty to a single criminal count arriving from civil litigation
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   Notably his sentencing judge called him a brilliant groundbreaking engineer our country needs
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.920]   mr
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.520]   Levendowsky has paid a significant price for his actions 179 million dollars although he did declare bankruptcy
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.160]   So maybe he hasn't and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.960]   so jeff is
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.880]   Hinting
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.920]   suddenly
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.400]   I never had it might have something to do with the fact that his sponsors in this included petered teal
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.160]   uh
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.360]   billionaire billionaire who uh facebook billionaire he was the first ally and a trump ally uh,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   and uh palmer lucky founder of oculus who was also a
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.080]   trump supporter
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.560]   uh michael ovitz is also on the list
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.120]   famous hollywood
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.680]   super agent disgrace rich guys just kind of hang out together you know, I guess they all know each other
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.800]   um anyway, um
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.640]   I you know, I don't know about the 179 million dollar award
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.800]   He got 127 million from google as in payment
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.920]   So I don't anyway, I don't know
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.600]   um
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   you know
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.080]   These were almost all of them were white color criminals. There were a lot of rap stars in the list, which is interesting
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.520]   Um, anyway, that's that's the google angle
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:18.320]   Not much more to say about that actually there was some disappointment in the um, uh in the internet community that uh
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.040]   Others like edward snoden julian assange
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.560]   uh were not pardoned or right
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   forgiven um
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.000]   Um, um, why do I want to call her rumor? Um, what's her name?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.800]   The one reality winner. Thank you reality winner. Not rumor winner
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.120]   reality winner
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   I would have liked to see her pardoned
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   Yeah, um
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.440]   But no pardons for them. Uh trump had made noise about pardoning snoden. He said something about that, but uh
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.560]   Apparently did not there was some concern that uh, what I read in the
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   Reports yesterday was that his
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.120]   That that neither the uh, parting of assange or snoden would be supported by the gop and trump was concerned about keeping them
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   Happy, uh, given that he is being impeached again and they will be
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.920]   Uh, trying him in the senate and so maybe they had something to do with that. Who knows?
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.280]   Who knows if you were to take a just a average man's poll average person's poll and say was um
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.400]   Snowden is Snowden a uh, uh, uh, uh
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.880]   One of my trying to say spy a bad guy good guy bad guys should is
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.200]   Should we um just slap his wrist for treason? If you were to take a poll would people say yes or no
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.680]   What would you I want to hear your answer first?
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:49.120]   I don't say treason because he opened the eyes of a lot of people that had no idea about the
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.720]   Surveillance that's going on that they didn't know anything about so yeah, I have no problem with it
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:05.120]   It is it is absolutely a conversation that when when the snowing event happened we had that conversation a lot around here and uh, even among
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.960]   Uh, our viewers were pretty up to date on Snowden and what he
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.360]   Uh revealed and so forth were were torn between the idea that he
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.680]   You know, look he had a promise. He was an nsa contractor. He had a promise to keep those secret
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.600]   Uh and those and those who said no, no, he you know, he was a whistleblower and there is some evidence that he tried to
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.960]   Uh go through channels, but was ignored and so felt like he had to do what he did
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.680]   So maybe that gives him a little bit of an out
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.640]   But I have a couple of them. I'm not as I'm not as sanguine about uh, uh julina sange
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.920]   I'm not convinced that his uh heart is in the right place, but no I I know I agree with that
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.040]   The issue there though is the precedent that gets set if he gets sent to america and tried on sedition
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.600]   Right. Um, there's issues for journalists then right? Nobody likes joy to sange
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.920]   No money likes he's said he's that guy who is creepy and weird
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.320]   But he's going to be the person who sets your precedent because you got to protect the creepy and weird too. Yeah. Yeah
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.720]   That's right. It's it's easy to defend people who are nice
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.120]   fuzzy cozy
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.320]   But uh, you know, it's kind of always been the case. Yeah, I just finished writing part of the book about about uh, uh,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.640]   john willocks not booth, uh, who was a libertine
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.240]   in uh in england and brought about freedom of the press and
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.600]   the end of general warrants and the ability for the press to report on the parlament
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.880]   And the ability to sue government for all kinds of things, but he was he was a libertane
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.160]   He was a he was a tremendous jerk in some ways, but it takes those kinds of people to push the lines
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.600]   Yeah, like you hefner was that who it was? No, not you hefner
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:51.360]   Don't know. Larry. Larry flint. Oh, yeah. Well better better. Uh, nice for example is, um,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.000]   stand-up comedian, um, help me out here. Oh, man. Andrew Deskley. No, no
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.200]   No, luis ck. No
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.240]   Um, lenny barus
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   Yeah, john slinging. I got that one happy birthday john. I didn't even know yesterday was your birthday and I did
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.680]   I neglected to say happy birthday john
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.880]   Who is somehow staying a little bit ahead of me? I don't know how he's doing that
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.040]   um
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.240]   at noon
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.680]   twitter
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.040]   Kept its promise and transferred the potus account
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   To president biden the flotus account to vice president harris
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.400]   But and created a new account. Oh, not
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.360]   And created a new account for
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.800]   second gentleman second gentleman a new account for second gentleman

[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.440]   So, uh, there was a little you know when when uh, this is all new we're making up the rules as we go along
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.200]   When president trump got president obitons account
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.160]   All of I mean obama's account all of obama's followers went to president trump
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.320]   twitter decided this time not to do that so uh president biden who had a
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:09.280]   Joseph our biden account which had three million followers that account just turned into at potus
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.960]   And just and kept 3.7 million followers did not keep how many did trump have at the end like 70 million
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.720]   I was almost 80. Yeah, did not keep all of those
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.520]   so, um, there i know
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.240]   Wait, wait

[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.160]   Oh, well potus potus is not his only
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.440]   7 now. Does that mean that's everybody who signed up today?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.960]   Starts as he started to zero at noon and then he already got it. No, it wasn't zero at noon when I went there
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.160]   I thought that who was there because I was following him at joseph biden and it automatically
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.720]   converted the follow to at potus
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.200]   Oh, because joe's albiden was his um
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.240]   No, it might have been you know and it might have been president elect or something it might have been some other yeah
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.520]   They they switched president elect became that's what it was
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.480]   So
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.640]   Okay, so he still has his personal account joe's albiden is
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.480]   suspended
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.600]   Suspended because it's not him. No, because it's not him. I don't think it was joe's albiden
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.640]   Was that what you were following really I was following
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:23.360]   Because I read joe biden for 25.2 million followers right now on the screen active
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.120]   Uh not suspended, uh even has a couple tweets within the last four years here's from the twitter blog
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.360]   What to expect on an ocuration day it was a little complicated. I admit so
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.800]   Why at white house potus vp flotus and press sec
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.720]   transitioned from trump the trump administration to the biden ministration
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   So president elect biden president elect biden became potus
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.560]   send
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   homa harris became vp
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.480]   floaters biden
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.080]   became flotus
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.720]   press sec pisaki became press sec
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.400]   And transition 46 became white house
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.480]   So I of course very confusing however
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.000]   Uh the but you know what that makes sense because people weren't following potus. They were following
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.920]   president trump
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.120]   Well, no, that's because remember president trump got potus, but he decided he didn't want to tweet from that
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   He wanted to tweet from his own right?
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.080]   You know what? I don't think it'll stay at 3.7 million followers for very long although
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:37.920]   I wouldn't mind. I don't know if you've noticed there was a study watching a post had this that said once they banned president trump saccad
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.840]   the number of
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.800]   Postings about false false news about election
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.520]   Uh fraud went down 73
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.240]   percent it was it turned out it was all being kind of
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.640]   Gend up by his own twitter council. I didn't well, but there's there's a few other factors there
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.480]   One is it was a terrible headline and it had like a repeat it all over
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.840]   Misinformation fell 73 percent on twitter when trump went off. That's just that's just absurd
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   Obviously you can't measure that wasn't miss that measure was it was it was election one hashtag
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.560]   Unless it was hashtag. Okay. Uh, number two
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:14.720]   The whole world shifted about then to yeah where it wasn't so much about of course election fraud
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.400]   It was about the coup and it was about everything else. Right and so
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.080]   Um, you know what it just wasn't the stuff that they were pumping anyway, so it was it was wildly
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.480]   Misinterpreted in stupid media
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.280]   Oh wait a minute
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.280]   I take it back. I was following prez elect biden
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.000]   And I did not get transferred over. I am not currently following at potus. Oh
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.640]   So that's you're exactly right. I have to add unless I screwed something up, but I have to add that following
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.120]   So anyway, you know my my actually my only point is
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.160]   It's twitter. Who the hell cares?
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.640]   And I do hope that
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.000]   The new president does not use twitter the same way the old president did oh
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.880]   Oh
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.200]   You have to you have to debate this you have to wonder this
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.640]   I didn't wonder I said I do hope that the new president
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.880]   No, I don't think twitter is an appropriate place for presidential declarations of war peace
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.360]   Fireings or hiring. Let's not we're gonna see pictures of his dog
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.680]   It's already it's already very clearly being handled by a social media expert and not by
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.080]   Twitter is upset. I always hate that people said twitter is upset twitter is upset because he's already broken his first campaign promise
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.240]   Which was he doesn't have a cat yet
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.520]   No, I'll have a cat by now
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.720]   the internets
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.840]   All this is I have no desire to follow
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.760]   Our new president is just because i'm sure whatever the president says or does or
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.800]   Happens to the president during it their tenure. I'm going to hear about it one way
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.240]   Oh, no. Oh no. Oh no, jiff jarvis says you won't know about it unless you follow twitter and facebook
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   You gotta follow
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.680]   Okay, you start early
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:16.720]   You said very specifically said we've never known about george floyd if it weren't for facebook I could
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.760]   If we only had those instant replay buttons wired
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.360]   By this we
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.200]   We didn't know about living while black
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.560]   Except when twitter cable long this is going on
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.320]   So don't say covered so don't say you didn't say that okay, so i'm just i'm quoting you that's all
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.200]   You're quoting me about it about a powerful white man
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.640]   If you're quoting me about black people that aren't getting covered, you know mean stream
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:49.200]   I look like you gotta be on twitter and facebook no you've said that many times if you want to know what anyway doesn't matter
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.880]   I'm I am I am being I am being censored. I can't talk about facebook on this show. So I won't
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.840]   No, no, no, no, no, that's not true. Oh, it's not true
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.880]   However, I did look there. Well, I couldn't find any facebook stories. Did you find some I wasn't looking?
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.560]   No, but hey, let's talk about google's latest aiethisis scandal
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.800]   Oh, yeah, there's another one. Well, but now this is an interesting one because
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:19.760]   Uh, okay, so there's a union now because it's another woman because I have so many questions following the dismissal of timnett gebrew
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.280]   Last year, which was you know very controversial. We reported on it
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.040]   Uh
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.720]   Somebody who's still there by the way that she was dismissed or do they still try to say that she was she? I don't know what's the latest on that but
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:38.560]   Uh, her colleague Margaret Mitchell who did not write gone with the win, but it is another Margaret Mitchell. She co leads the ethical ai team
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.320]   Uh is in trouble because apparently
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.520]   She hasn't been fired, but her account
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.080]   Uh her corporate account at according to axios at google has been locked
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.960]   Because she has been
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:01.840]   Exfiltrating she'd been using automated scripts to look through her messages to find examples showing discriminatory discriminatory treatment of gebrew
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.720]   Uh, and
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.200]   Then exfiltrating it outside google to other places
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.080]   So google said our security systems automatically lock an employee's corporate account
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.400]   When they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.320]   And this is this is the war when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.240]   In this instance yesterday our system detected an account had exfiltrated
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.960]   thousands of files
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.280]   And shared them with multiple external accounts
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.440]   We explained this to the employee earlier today. She's not been fired, but her account was locked
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.240]   In my opinion for a very good reason
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.600]   Well, so hold on because people can like those rules can be written very broadly to
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.720]   be used as a tool when necessary
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.360]   So if normal use and practice in google is to send certain data places and i don't know if it is
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.040]   But you know, I used to send files from my work computer to my home computer because I was working on things
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.560]   And it could be that she did that
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.120]   Over her tenure for various things and then google is using that now
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.720]   I mean i've been saying over 10 years or something. I understand
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:23.040]   Yeah, we just don't know and we don't know if google like applied this like suddenly looked at her account was like, uh, let's see what we can get her for
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.280]   this
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.080]   I just showed up. She asked mitchell for a comment. She did not reply
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.160]   Uh google her tweet was pretty terrible from a from a business perspective. She's her tweet say you have a problem
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.560]   with consistently alienating black women and have caused serious damage in their lives you could a
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.880]   Try to undo that damage or b find more black people
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.800]   To like you the tokenism approach good luck
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.840]   That's the tweet you're talking about
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.520]   Yes, I because oh this was makes you say it's terrible
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.840]   This was because this was in response to senator pachai meeting with historically black college
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.000]   Yes, yes. So her boss big her granddaddy boss is meeting with
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.600]   uh, historically with black colleges, oh dog
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:17.520]   Um, and you tweet this it it is kind of snarky. That was pavlovian. But it was a really was a really weird pavlovian with a twist
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.320]   Yeah, no so this is triggers the dog or the dog triggers you
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:28.000]   I'm just wondering it is i'm the one who salivating so I don't understand
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.600]   So yeah, I left out
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.520]   And this is the problem I have with twitter context. So so that makes no sense unless you see
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:45.440]   That there is also a link in that tweet to this story on cnm google ceo to meet with black college leaders following racism allegations
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.720]   Is that the problem with twitter or the problem with the story that quoted the tweet without the context
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.880]   Well, uh, yeah, okay, but the axios story has the context you just have to read one paragraph up
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   Right. Oh, let's see if it he doesn't do that
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.120]   He does it's not a picture. It's a whole fair grab
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   [Laughter]
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.800]   Give you give me crap. I'm gonna give you crap. That's the way it works. You started it
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:17.680]   Who wrote this tons of amazing stuff in google research report is that you
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.560]   Yeah, it was too much to read but I thought you might be looking at it quicker than I could to see
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.600]   It's just huge. Do they have pictures because otherwise I don't know if I should just look at this. Okay. Yes, they
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.280]   When I joined google says longer than a tweet though Leo so might be a problem here because
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:40.640]   This is jeff dean senior fellow and senior vice president of google research and health on behalf of the entire
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.840]   Google research community. I'm exhausted already
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.600]   winner
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   Um, it has a table. It's a blog post with a table of contents. Do I
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:56.720]   Do I this is uh item what line is that there? That's uh, 18 18
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   18
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.480]   We're taking over the show. Oh, please. I wish you would
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.200]   uh
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.480]   I don't know what it's pictures. Here's searches for fever. Here's uh, here's some
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:17.440]   Spasio temporal graph for modeling covid 19 spread. I'm just looking at the pictures. You understand here's
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.000]   uh, either that's a river or
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.160]   a biopsy and they assigned it a Gleason grade
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.120]   This is a uh, the green is a Gleason pattern of three yellow is a Gleason pattern of four. So there you go
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.840]   Well, that's why that was me that was me you're Gleason for
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.360]   I think that's why I had it out. Yeah. Yeah prostate cancer
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.280]   Uh, here's a hemoglobin levels
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.520]   One of my
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   This is a jeff
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.520]   Cool accessibility stuff we talked about lookout but the
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.000]   Okay, this could be the ai change log
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.880]   It's the ai
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.200]   It's tons of deep things about ai that they're doing. Yeah, it's basically just I mean
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.120]   That's kind of what this is. It's like a change log for the whole year on ai stuff
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.640]   So nice, maybe we'll forget about their their burt model not being as accurate or as fair
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.760]   Based on the research from the last or we talked about
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.680]   Um, and we can look at all this other great stuff. Yeah, we're not getting excited about a a technique called hydro nets
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.960]   That uses a network of neural models that the neural networks that models a river system
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.600]   Oh, that's interesting all of this
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.040]   All of this stuff here at the bottom of it is just like a whole different language to me
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.320]   I have no idea what they're talking about in that in that section
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.240]   You see there's a there's the accessibility one. This is like hot dog not hot dog. Although
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.480]   Uh, it tells you mustard pickles. So it's called actually you may have used this. It's a lookout
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.320]   Which is an android application. Yeah, I'm gonna look at this. Yeah, instead of uh
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   You know the one where humans help you
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.720]   Um, this is uh actually ai trying to understand but now is this does this still work?
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.120]   Is people are people using this they haven't they I don't know if they actually deployed it to many people
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.200]   They released lookout as an android application
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.320]   Look at it. Oh, okay. I have to put it on the time. I see
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.560]   And then translating asl how fascinating is that?
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.360]   That's actually not translating asl
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.680]   It's pointing out that someone's using actual sign language and then you can say hey, this person's actually speaking right now
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.040]   Oh, it doesn't know what it says, but it knows that it's real. Oh, it's there. Well, that'll be they'll come next month
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.560]   Yeah, that was kind of cool today when she did the pledge of allegiance and sign
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.040]   As well as speaking it. I thought that was great
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.920]   Um, so this detects
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:42.240]   Sign language. It doesn't understand it, but it detects it. Yeah. Yeah. Well first step, you know, uh, there is a uh
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   responsible AI section here, uh
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:54.560]   Fly which could be considered this is irony. This is the drosophila, which is a fruit fly hemibrine
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.200]   connectome
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.800]   Oh wow
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.240]   Connectomes
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.320]   So, uh, this is actually comes from a science or I know about this from a science fiction novel called the fall by niel
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.080]   Stevenson and which he says you know, it was hoping to do the fly if you're aren't going to save
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.440]   You don't really put somebody's brain in a jar that would be dumb
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.800]   What you do is you put their connectome in in a database, which is all the connections that the brain has made
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.200]   Because that's the actual
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.320]   Brain state. So that's what this is doing the actual connectome
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.720]   Of you know, not a big brain a fruit fly brain, but still
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.920]   That's a lot of data. That's a lot of data. The connective
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.960]   I predict will soon be letting readying out our unused brain space for data storage
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:48.080]   Many ring neurons in the ellipsoid body or visual feature detectors that would make sense if you're a fruit fly. That's important
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   Compass neurons in the eb and the protoceribral bridge are key parts of this system
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.800]   You're not serious. Are you Jeff?
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.680]   No, I'm not I was thinking sci-fi
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.800]   It's kind of cool though. Look at that the connect. I'm yeah, I thought you have the of the drosophila
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   Hemi brain
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:13.040]   Yeah, you know what this is a neat this is actually a neat report. I mean this is a lot of stuff on here
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:20.560]   Marketing it's just marketing things here, but it is oh sure remember. This is a marketing exercise
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.880]   But so was you know Bell Labs, right? So we don't have Bell Labs
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   Well, we have Bell Labs, but we don't really have Bell Labs anymore
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.120]   So, you know we gotta have somewhere this stuff happens
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.800]   Well Bell Labs actually personalized a lot of this technology much of Google's much vaunted
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   AI and
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.520]   You know even some of their search stuff has been when deployed in the real world proven less than less than perfect
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.040]   I shouldn't say much some it is hard to really track
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.080]   Well
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.120]   You're right. I'm a journalist darn it and that is my job. So to get back to the
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.680]   The key loss that reputation by being here the Margaret Mitchell story
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.240]   I guess we will wait and see because she hasn't been fired, but they cut her off for her google account
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.560]   For what they consider inappropriate use she says, you know
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.880]   uh, you know the firing of gebrew we've got a we've got a
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.720]   Collect the information the background information you think that google will be a little better at reading the room
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.520]   Yeah, I don't have a problem with her tweet
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.520]   No, she's just it doesn't say in what she feels and granted it's gonna be harsh
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.400]   But it's it's a harsh truth if you look at it
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.440]   Google isn't saying anything about the tweet
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.800]   Um, maybe that had to do with it, but that was axios is you know connection not not googles
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.440]   Right. Well, yeah, it's not like google's gonna be like and we didn't like her tweet
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:52.080]   I mean there is there is actually his I mean journalists newspapers do this a lot
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.400]   They're like uh that was not an appropriate tweet. We're taking you offline or we're suspending you
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.080]   So the war between google facebook and australian news sites is stepping up
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.600]   Uh google is apparently admitting to blocking australian news sites from search results
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.480]   This is as a test they did a test. Maybe it maybe again not them reading the room, but they did a small test
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.560]   Yeah, it's like firing a cannon across a shot across the bow. It's like, you know, by the way
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.320]   We could do this we get his power, you know, we're
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.640]   google spokesperson told told the uh, sydney morning herald
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.120]   We're running a few experiments
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:37.440]   That will each reach about 1% of google search users in australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and google search on each other
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.880]   We wanted to see the human reaction of the head of a head of a horse in a bed
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.680]   That's just eric. Oh, that's hysterical. We just want to measure the impact. That's all
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.400]   It's not a big deal in case we might do it
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.360]   So what is the deal uh jeff that australia government has decided that google and facebook has to pay
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.200]   These news sources for for the snippets they use in their search is that what right and both are saying
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.080]   uh variations of f u
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.040]   um
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.520]   And and the fight before was we talked about this a few weeks ago the fight before was that there was only one
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.240]   Side of value that that supposedly
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.440]   All the value went from the publishers to google and google said hey we're spending these publishers a lot of traffic
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.760]   And they weren't allowed to use that well then
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.400]   Uh australia said okay fine use that in the negotiation, but you must negotiate right
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.480]   And google and facebook are saying this is a form of negotiation
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.640]   By the way, it's not yet. I know you don't google
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.160]   Okay google stop. I'm sorry. I talked about google's always listening. Uh, this is not yet a law
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.880]   Uh lawmakers haven't voted on it. Okay google stop
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:47.360]   But uh, it is kind of I mean look that's
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.480]   We're just seeing what happens
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.560]   If we disconnect yeah, you know, it's people from our search, you know, no big
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:03.680]   And the uh this according to the search engine journal this comes across as an attempt to intimidate lawmakers
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.240]   Into voting against the proposed
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.000]   New rule that would force google and facebook to share revenue
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.600]   Meanwhile, we have vint surf the grandfather of the net
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.160]   The intern saying that the legislation
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   Fundamentally threatens the existence of a free and open internet and I completely agree
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.160]   Yeah, because if you're gonna make everybody pay for everything I can't like you can I can't link to you unless I pay you to link to you
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:33.440]   That just destroys might be worth pointing out that vent is in fact google's chief internet
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.840]   Yes, and he is but then so the father in the net but he works for google
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:44.160]   Then the other story I put in here that I don't know is that the new york post says that our trade reps are asking australia
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.800]   to delay the law, but I don't know in these cases whether it's real trade reps or
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.280]   mr. yesterday's trade reps
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.360]   Well, it wouldn't be I don't think biden has had a chance to get any trade reps in position
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.400]   Well, are they are they career people or are they purely political people? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know yet either. Yeah
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.440]   uh
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.840]   Daniel bahar and carl ailers asked australia to suspend the plans
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.800]   All right, so we don't know
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.880]   Yeah, it seems like a bad idea, but you know google's just really showing that hey
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.760]   If you do this we we can do what we did in uh, where was it spain spain just cut you off
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.400]   Well, there there it's a little differently. Oh because they're what they did was they pulled out google news
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.640]   Right, that's and you know it hurts some newspapers. It doesn't really hurt the users that much but what google's doing here
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.120]   Is saying what if we took news out of search results? What facebook's doing is saying
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:42.160]   Uh, is there threatening to say we're gonna we're gonna forbid both publishers and users pretty news up on facebook
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   So this is the steaks are up
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.480]   I want to take a little break here and we will continue
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.440]   With this week in google boy. It's all google so far good job everybody
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:01.200]   And the crowd goes wild at the crowd is stacey hagan bossom of stacey on iot.com jeff javas
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.920]   from buzz machine dot com and of course sat pruit from hands on
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.360]   photography
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:16.320]   Our show today brought you by a new sponsor, but I and i'm dying to get this the company's called nareva and u r e v
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.480]   a
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.680]   And there's something that's near and dear to my heart. There's sound experts or sound engineers
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.400]   How many times and it happens all the time? I still see it on the news all the time
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   You're you're doing a zoom call. You're doing a google meet
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.880]   You're doing a teams
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.000]   And the person eat it the worst thing is if it's a big conference room and it's just a lot of
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.480]   Noise in the conference room or you know people are off mic
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.280]   honestly
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:52.240]   What we're doing right now social distancing has big app implications for meeting room
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.320]   audio and nareva has a really great
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.480]   Solution for you
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.560]   It's good mic coverage while people are distanced in a meeting space
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.680]   They're sitting six feet apart, but that means at least some of them are sitting six feet away from the microphone
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.120]   Most conventional audio systems just aren't going to handle that well
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.680]   Somebody's going to be too loud. Somebody's going to be too quiet. Somebody you're not even going to be able to hear it all
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:21.440]   You can get a beam forming system system, but then you got to have an intent technician come in and adjust it
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:29.200]   You got a tabletop system that that's going to require more mics spread around and then you what do you got to do? You got to sanitize them
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.760]   in between meetings
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:38.960]   And it both may require participants to sit in specific predetermined spots face in a certain direction. It just doesn't work
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.760]   What if there were a better way to get clear?
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.520]   reliable audio
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:48.400]   So that your team could sit where they want act like they want face the way they want and still
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   Be heard feel safe and still be heard. That's nareva audio. It is so cool. I got a demo and I was blown away
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.200]   It's the first socially distanced mic system
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.560]   Nareva uses a completely original approach to audio conferencing. They call it microphone mist technology
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   And it's really cool. Hey, you were there. We we were talking with them
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:17.520]   It fills the room with thousands of virtual not real but virtual microphones using computational audio you get true
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:24.640]   Full room coverage people can be heard from anywhere in the room no matter where they sit no matter how they face no matter how they're distanced
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.280]   No technician necessary
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.040]   You can install each microphone and speaker bar on the wall but all by yourself
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:38.080]   But the smarts in the nareva technology automatically adapts to the room's configuration
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.760]   And every time new people come in and automatically adapts to that
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.120]   And not just a 10 by 10 room any size
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.960]   Microphone mist technology has four patents
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.480]   They've won numerous awards. They just won the top new technology word at ISE 2020
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.520]   That's for their HDL 200 system from nareva
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:05.040]   It has as you said it doesn't matter what size room they have a full line of systems for small medium and large spaces
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.840]   Uh lots of happy customers that's one array by the tv or their multiple arrays
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.000]   There's one array that thing about that bar above the tv. That's it. That's it
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.680]   Wow, but but see this is where we've come so far in computational
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.960]   Audio it's kind of like computational photography
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.240]   Uh, they can really in and in real time it automatically adjusts as people move around
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:32.640]   Um, they use it at hub spot. Jimmy and they're a principal collaboration engineer at hub spot says
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.680]   We were so impressed with the sound quality the ease of install the ease of the use of the hdl 300
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.000]   It was a no brainer for us to adopt it
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.400]   So if you've got meaning rooms
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.560]   And you want people to be safe in those meeting rooms
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.120]   You need nareva learn how nareva and you are eva audio is the simple cost effective
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.960]   Way to let your team's distance and meetings and still act and converse
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:03.280]   Naturally, if you go to nareva.com/treat you can get a demo you can hear it. It's pretty cool nareva n u r e v a dot com
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:09.360]   Slash twit solve i'm stupid. What I didn't get the the safety angle
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.920]   Oh, yeah, yeah, right?
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:17.120]   So you can be socially distant and still be heard and you're wearing masks. I mean, I think it's cool without that
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:21.440]   Well, you yeah, and that's the thing you get closer to the mic. Hey, can you get closer?
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.080]   I actually you'll love it a lot of universities use it now
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.840]   You love it. It's really I'm thinking exactly for classroom thinking immediately. Yeah, and see you don't know ahead of time
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.680]   Uh hybrid some people off some people on so that's really I can see that never one of our classrooms
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.640]   Yeah
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:44.320]   And it's pandas really clever. This is like anything you've seen before it's really really interesting go and read more at nareva.com slash
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.480]   twit
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.400]   I didn't mean interrupt. You had a no. You can always ask. I don't you know, that's great
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.120]   If you're asking that means the door tech guy right now listeners are asking and so they want to know
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:04.080]   So, um, I thought a really good blog piece. I wanted to share this with you. Uh, not crazy about the name of the blog assassin ate you dot net
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.200]   It's the blog of the assassin
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.160]   But it's actually yeah
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.640]   Uh, he's actually a
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.920]   He or she actually that's a good question. I don't know it's hard to tell with the ninja outfit
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.880]   Um
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.960]   You know
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.040]   It doesn't really doesn't say I didn't understand this one on the rundown. I didn't I didn't explain it
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   So you may remember that github
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.880]   Took down a very popular open source youtube download or youtube dash dl
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.240]   But they took it down
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.840]   For a very interesting reason they got a dmca complaint now normally from the ria
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:50.800]   The recording industry association of america normally these dmca complaints are it's copyright violation
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.240]   That's not what the dmca
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.040]   takedown was
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.440]   They wanted to take have it taken down because
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.320]   Let me see if I can find the exact
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.120]   phrase
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.280]   Essentially because it uh, it was bypassing
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.720]   Uh copy protection
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:22.400]   So uh when it happened there were of course a lot of users of youtube dl were very upset
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.600]   The electronic frontier foundation
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   Uh weighed in they filed a counter notice
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:36.560]   Explaining why the ria's takedown was itself an abuse of the dmca and
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   It was not justified at all
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.400]   The youtube
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.360]   dl code repository had zero zero infringing material
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:56.560]   The ria claimed that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of artists
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.400]   Represented by the ria whose songs were on youtube
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.280]   That is not obviously the primary purpose
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.560]   It's a youtube downloader. You can use it download this show
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:13.680]   The one little mistake they probably made that the project made is they had a um they had test code
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.800]   Which would download snippets of songs from youtube
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.520]   Um, that was test code that was not seen by regular users. It was just seen by coders who were working with it
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.640]   Was already tested and the eff said
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.400]   Even that is is a form of fair use and allowed
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.280]   So the eff's counter uh notice was necessary
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.920]   Even when github was doing it they said
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.240]   We don't want to do this
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.720]   We're sorry, but we feel like we have to
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.240]   And so once the eff filed its
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.320]   Counter notice it gave github the excuse that oh, okay. We're gonna put it back
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.880]   github reinstated the repository
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.320]   And importantly when you're this one's complicated if you're a coder you understand what get does
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.640]   github which is the software which is the hosting of the software called git
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:10.480]   Uh, there's other places you can host it, but besides saving the code it saves all this metadata about who uploaded it
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.200]   Which code replaces which code?
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:18.880]   Uh, what's more recent than others this metadata is at least as impa as important as the code
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:25.040]   You know probably other people have the code, but that metadata pull requests bug reports
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.760]   Our vital and so the reinstatement of that was important otherwise it would have been easy for youtube
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.880]   D'etat
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.080]   Dash dl to move to git lab or do their own thing or whatever
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.800]   So his his point is
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.040]   We were saved it was a bogus pull take down anyway
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.320]   But he also said
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.480]   Folks, this is why if you're an open source project
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.080]   You shouldn't just put it up on github and think you're done
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:02.480]   Because if you do get pulled down and you lose all that metadata that could be disastrous for any open source
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.400]   Project
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.040]   Men he writes maintainers who host their projects in a large
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.480]   Proprietary platforms like github or git lab git lab should always have a strategy
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:20.240]   For such situations they need to set up mirrors proactively you've got to back up metadata, which is really really hard
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:26.320]   The free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. So good news
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:35.120]   That it will be of general interest download the youtube downloader is safe and is up and thanks to the eff for doing that
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.440]   but also news a little more
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.280]   Of of less interest the general public but an important
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:47.680]   Thing to understand is if you are putting stuff on github or git lab or any big public repository
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.880]   You've got to also have a strategy for keeping that stuff safe in case this happens to you
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:43:03.040]   I like to mention about having some type of contingency plan because it seems like that's why someone would use github is because of how difficult it is to
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:12.000]   Back up all of that information. What are what do you suggest as a contingency? Well, he I don't I'm not an expert on this. He suggests
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.120]   A tool called gitia or giti
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:23.760]   He said that's not necessarily the perfect solution. There's an experimental tool called git bud, but I'm sorry git bug
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.520]   But his point really is kind of more like a call to the open source community
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.640]   We got a we got to think about this and figure this out
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.720]   All right, and it's you know
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.960]   No, thanks, but no thanks to the ri which is just notorious and all this stuff. Yeah, they're not
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.000]   Nice people. No thanks to the eff for for solving. They're nice people
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   They're nice people
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.680]   And uh, yeah, so good news, you know the
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.960]   People were still able to use you the youtube
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.480]   Downloader for out in other ways and so forth, but it's good. It's it's still up there
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.680]   Um
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.720]   Facebook you want to do some facebook stuff
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.040]   never
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.040]   depends
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.920]   Are you gonna yell at me?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   You know the judge has said uh
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:22.640]   Facebook in the in the in the United States again versus facebook lawsuit anti trust lawsuit
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.160]   March
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.400]   Is a deadline for
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.880]   both parties to have their briefs
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.920]   So long bet here
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.040]   How long did microsoft and i trust take how long will this one take?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.280]   That's a good question. So here's the time of a couple decades, right? Yeah
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.120]   judge boasburg of the district club he said facebook has till march 10th to respond to the
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.480]   States and the ftc complaint and then the states and the ftc have until april 7th to respond
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:45:01.040]   Uh, there are two different lawsuits going on. There's the ftc and then this what was the 46 states and guam or whatever?
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.640]   um
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.680]   So
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   I don't know if that gives us an idea of the time frame. That's pretty quick. It does actually
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.760]   Well, that's quick, but it's gonna. This is gonna go on forever, right? How long did microsoft go on?
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.240]   uh, it started in 98
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:20.160]   And it didn't ever end it ended because microsoft did it agreed to consent decree
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.040]   And I think that was
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:30.160]   Maybe eight years later. Let me say we should say it could have gone even longer. Yeah, microsoft kind of said, okay, okay, okay
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.320]   Okay, how about this so my prediction here so long bet is that is the facebook
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.000]   Is going to get replaced in three different ways in the next decade and and it's going to be even less
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.640]   An issue. I think people are going to invent new facebook's that are better facebook's. I don't think it's going to be the force that everybody thinks it is forever
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.160]   Here's the timeline
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:55.600]   DOJ in 19 states plus the district clumia filed may of 98
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.040]   went on and on and on until
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.800]   The settlement was approved in june of 2004 so six years six years
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.200]   But you're right it would have gone on even longer had this settlement not
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.880]   Yeah, well wait a minute. I that was page one
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:19.120]   You were
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   Page one page two
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.040]   Wait, can we scroll down to
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.240]   There's page three
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:34.160]   2011 I was 11 it took your math again 13 years
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   13
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.760]   Fight over android and jot's been on it going on a decade. Is that is it done? No
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.560]   Okay
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.840]   So here's my suggestion. I think that we can these these small baby steps on these suits
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:57.440]   I think we can not should we not worry about those? Okay. I don't think we got to worry about okay. I'll take those
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.880]   I think you should google antitrust any of them
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.600]   Yeah, there's a like either an annual update or you should just note them as they happen. They're not that
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.680]   I mean the big moves aren't that
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:16.240]   Page three I mean this this sort of stuff sets the tone of the argument. Okay. I want to know that
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.680]   I'll do a thing every page. So like in six years, we'll do page two. Okay got it
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.520]   It's like the the google annual ai
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:32.080]   Dog and pony show you'll have the yeah the big tech and here's what happened. Yeah. Here's what happened in the lawsuits
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.960]   um
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:43.200]   Turkey has slapped an ad ban on twitter under a new social media law
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.120]   So
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.400]   Twitter and government's not going to be friendly right now because yeah
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.480]   so
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.920]   What Jack did apparently the law in Turkey is at the
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.680]   Twitter periscope and Pinterest have to appoint local representatives. This is a new social
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.760]   media law into the law which critics say stifles defense
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.240]   I'm sorry dissent social media companies that do not appoint such representatives are liable for penalties
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:19.280]   including this one which allows the authorities to say yeah, you can't take any more ads
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.640]   So you you know you can keep tweeting
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.840]   but it's not over because
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.160]   Twitter and Pinterest bandwidth
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:34.640]   If they don't comply will be cut 50% in April and by 90% in may
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:40.320]   Oh my god, that's so wrong. This is going to slowly squeeze squeeze them
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.440]   Wow, that's creative. Yeah
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.560]   And is that because they have they state own their infrastructure? Yeah, I guess
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.840]   Oh, nationalized
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.200]   international so deputy transport minister
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.000]   Sion
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.040]   Says we are determined to do whatever is necessary to protect the data privacy and rights of our nation
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.920]   We will never allow digital fascism
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:15.600]   And the disregard of rules should prevail in turkey. This is by the way what president erton one has also said so he's just you know
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.440]   Well also very related to this is the poland story. We should do it these together poland
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.280]   Says we would never
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.960]   We would never do what twitter did. I'm trying to find the poland story so I can give you the quote
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.480]   Uh, but this was was this the president of poland
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.440]   Yeah, but basically poland said very upset you from taking down us. Yeah. Yeah
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.320]   Uh very upset over uh
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.760]   What twitter did to president trump all I can find is twitter is poland's twitter account
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.440]   apparently uh today is world bego stay
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.520]   one of the
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.400]   best known polish dishes often referred to as a hunter stew
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.080]   The main ingredients of which are sauerkraut and fresh cabbage
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.560]   Poland guardian poland plant
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.320]   I know it's like cabbage and cabbage. That's the main
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.960]   It's okay. There's fermented cabbage and fresh cabbage cabbage cabbage cabbage cabbage
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   There's sauerkraut there's cabbage cabbage cabbage. There's a lot of nuance to cabbage
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.400]   I want some bigos. Let's have some bigos for uh dinner
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:28.640]   Uh guardian poland plans to make sensory and of social media accounts illegal. That's it
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:35.440]   So this is this really is very similar to what uh annila murkel said in in germany and in manuel macron and france
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:40.560]   They just they're they're kind of all stunned by the fact that twitter could take the elected
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.280]   I don't want to do any more trump stories. Can we just not do any more trump stories and just say
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:52.240]   We can just talk about about poland not trump. Yeah, I agree with you. I I have like a hundred gags today and I just stopped
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.280]   I don't want to do anymore stop. I don't want to do anymore
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.560]   But basically that they were shocked that the and I think I understand this to be honest with you
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.280]   Cory doctor wrote a very interesting piece
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.120]   uh all about this they he was they were shocked that
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.840]   A private company could basically deplatform the elected
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.040]   Head of a country and well wait wait wait
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.440]   So if you're if they all contend that that the platform was remedial
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.000]   Yes, let's just go with that for a second though. I'm gonna stipulate that I disagree with that
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.920]   But let's just leave it there right so could somebody walk into marty baron's office at the washington post and say
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:33.520]   You must carry no this op-ed by time. No, you would never do that. Yeah, right?
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:41.040]   So now here you have mackerel and and miracle and poland saying basically we're gonna compel you to carry our speech
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.920]   Hello, does europe not remember a few things
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.320]   Yeah
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.240]   Basically, Cory said the problem really is a failure
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:57.920]   To enforce our our eddy trust laws for for four decades or more
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:05.200]   That's the real problem. He says we have a duopoly of mobile platforms ios and android and ole goppley of cloud providers
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.040]   Amazon
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.560]   AWS
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.080]   Microsoft and google a small conspiracy of payment processors by the way that's
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.680]   One shouldn't overlook that you know that the payment process
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:26.560]   Parliament of crows. Yes, seriously of payment processors Cory says it can small conspiracy. Yeah, maybe that's his new uh, his group
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.800]   Group noun for payment process their choices about who
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:38.400]   May speak are hugely consequential and a concerted effort by all of them could make some points of view effectively vanish
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.120]   But I have to point out ben tomsons good peace and stratecary in which or no
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   I'm sorry mike maznik on tech dirt
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.680]   Who said you know what this is the market speaking?
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:56.160]   You know the free market a bunch of independent capitalist entities said yeah, we don't want this on our platform if our three national newspapers in america
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.680]   Decided or our three 24-hour news networks in america decided we're going to stop putting out people who do this
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.560]   Well, I think it's no different Cory would argue the same thing that that's a failure of any trust as well
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.040]   He's a very clever way to cook Cory's argument and then Cory's very good at that
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:18.080]   But there's a higher level principle here, which is compelled speech is not free speech the right to choose what you carry is
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.240]   Free speech absolutely and he agrees with you. He says the remedy for this is not
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:30.080]   Forcing the platforms to carry objectionable speech. He disagrees with poland and macron and and merkel
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.200]   He says the remedy though break him up is enforcing not break him up
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:38.480]   But enforcing any trust so that the censorship policies of two app stores don't carry the force of law
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.280]   And I don't I don't completely disagree with him
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.400]   I don't completely disagree either, but I think I think it's a it's a it's a speechless tie of the two issues
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.800]   And I don't really necessarily want to tie them together. That's all okay
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:55.520]   I mean far before me to ever call Cory doctor argument speeches. I don't mean that because he's brilliant, but
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.960]   I'm just cautious about tying those two together
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:06.240]   He says and he the solution may not be breaking these things up the solution may be
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.600]   More decentralized platforms. That's exactly right
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.760]   Yeah, and that's exactly what he supports
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.360]   Uh for instance, he wrote on the well. He says
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.520]   uh
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.640]   It's you know, what should app on google do about parlor they should remove it
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:28.080]   And they should say to users we remove parlor because we think it's a politically odious attempt to foment violence
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.960]   Our judgment however is subjective
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:36.000]   And maybe wielded against others in future if you don't like our judgment you shouldn't use our app store
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   Right at least say that
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:43.760]   Yeah, at least say that and then he says that invites a question. Well, okay. How do we switch app stores?
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.520]   Right and he's right, but my fear is just like the 230 debate my fear is this is going to be used as another cudgel
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:56.640]   Uh, right without his logic and without his principles to say oh good another way to punish the platforms another rational finish
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.360]   The plot and I agree with you on that. That is not what we want
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.960]   But it but it is clear that if you have two app stores in the world
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.120]   Yeah, that's a niche and it's a little bit over concentration of power
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:14.400]   It's one of the reasons why I moved off twitter to uh mastodon and why we have a just you know our twit social platform is a distributed
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.240]   Twitter and and I think that that's a much better solution. No one
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:24.320]   Company controls the content thereof, you know, but the same count when the
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:29.440]   App stores did not do a good job of controlling bad apps there. They got in trouble for that trouble
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.680]   They control and they get in trouble, you know, it's well. No, no, but that's but that but see that would all
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.920]   be solved by cori's thing because
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:42.080]   Again, having a choice solves all these problems. The problem really is he says is lack of choice
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.480]   Unless it's also odious
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.840]   That nobody puts it up and then they're still gonna complain. Well if 20 platforms are odi uh, decided sodius
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.120]   That's a little less concerning than if two do right
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:59.840]   It's not like saying no no if we go go back to the media thing again stipulated platforms about media
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.000]   but um, you get the right contending that this entire
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.880]   mess of a hundred newspapers
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.920]   Won't do something and that there's a hundred choices. There's a hundred newspapers you get to mall now
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.400]   But they're saying they're all liberal and they all
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:21.360]   Operate in lockstep and they're all canceling us. So the the volume didn't really make any difference in that argument. Right
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.800]   Um
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   All right, I think I want to change
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:34.000]   Final thought and it's a final thought. Oh no, I said I think this is the one time I'd rather we talk about tick-tock
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:40.480]   Or musicals, how do you feel about musical musical
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.120]   Okay, hold on hold on hold on
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.240]   All right, um
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.360]   Bridgerton bridgerton. I have you oh you already know about it. That's a pretty good show
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.600]   Rundown are we talking about the like soapy Romeo? I haven't finished watching it, but it's a I don't like bridgerton
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.920]   Oh
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.440]   Why not?
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   I feel like it's kind of cheap
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.480]   Like there's way too much CGI and fake if what it looks like to me
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:19.600]   Is a soap opera version of downton Abbey or upstairs? It is yeah, that's what it is. I understand
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.680]   But the only thing that distinguishes by the way soap opera
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:29.600]   From these high-toned merchandise reproductions is the production value the content
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.640]   You cannot tell me it remains of the day is equivalent to no, it's brilliant. It's brilliant
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.920]   Okay, so two things the writing and the production value, okay?
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   Well wait, three things the writing the acting and the production value, okay
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:50.640]   Yeah, so so so but it's all kind of so you know, it needs a little song and dance that'll fix it
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:56.960]   That's the only reason I don't like bridgerton is I just feels a little cheesy, you know, I'm saying is no one say that it's not
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.920]   Cheesy, I mean it's pure escapism. Oh, we're not chosen you like them
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.760]   Yeah
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.400]   No, I just you know what I'm watching instead
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:12.080]   I'm watching the remake of upstairs downstairs. It's great. I'm rewatching you know, what's really good
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.600]   It's the new masterpiece theater all creatures great and small. Did you watch
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.320]   Jeffrey
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   What what you don't like animals?
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.560]   Okay, what's wrong with you? You don't like your sure vets
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.280]   Oh, you're a voice to watch I wanted to be a vet and my mom gave me the James Harriet books
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:35.440]   Including all which were great 10 or I think I was like 10 they were trickily
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:42.800]   They were annoying and he always had his hand up some animals orifice. They did a lot of that
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.600]   It was it was like there's a lot of that. I admit it
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.360]   No, it's
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.720]   He desired to be a vet away from me. Well, maybe that was her intent
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:55.360]   Also made me like hate any novels set in like rural England
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   All you need to do Lottie is put a sheepskin on it
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:08.720]   So that's not a york shag said, but I can't do I wish I could I love the I love it
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:14.000]   Um, I watched the old shows jeff you remember those ancient all creatures. Oh, I didn't watch long
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.680]   Oh, God. I loved them and the new ones are fam are fantastic
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.640]   Bridgerton is like that. It's not like it's not but it's just so it's it's it's kind of
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.440]   Cheesier
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.840]   So again, let's play the cheesy music for aunt. All right
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.520]   It hasn't run me
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:39.200]   Why am I why am I getting too sound go go to her go to the next link
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:43.360]   On the rundown on the rundown on the rundown on the rundown on the rundown

[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.880]   Oh, hey guys. Oh, no, it's your standing there
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.720]   Since you guys love washing the process of bridgerton being made emily and I have decided to do some specific live streams

[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.560]   Oh, no, no, I don't know what I'm seeing nor do I care
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   No one can wait wait
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:22.960]   Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez. I like bridgerton and I'm not even sure I'm ready for this. Okay. Here's here's one. Here's one
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.760]   Here's a dance a dance concept video
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:33.040]   I don't know why the audio is so yeah, the audio is so bad. It's my fault. I'm sure yeah, it's your phone
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.960]   Uh, do the third one on top that's that's an example
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.600]   the next one
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.040]   Far right top. What if bridgerton where musical the dual part two? There you go. Yeah, that's
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.960]   I don't think so. I know but that's what that's the point. We want to torture and
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.320]   It's edgy thanks
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:59.120]   I'm sorry about the audio. I don't know what's going on
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.720]   Yeah, it's something with the mission. I don't care. It's fine. Yeah, you're ruined the bet
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.360]   The buzz no, but it was too annoying. It was ruined already. Jeff. I'm so sorry. I'm I wouldn't be with you, but no
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.880]   I will agree with the head on on that buzzfeed page that says I think we can all admit it that at this point tick tock
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.560]   It's full of talent just waiting to be discovered. That is I agree so true
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.480]   Waiting to be discovered and still undiscovered I might add
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.200]   Because that's a lot of it is a lot of talented people out there doing some nice content there
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.160]   Well, it's not always trying to get into me, but it is pretty talented to see what they come up with
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.120]   And you can have lots of talent, but you also have to have luck
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.080]   Uh, you have to be in the right location. You have to I mean you need sex. So
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.560]   It no, I think I think it kind of belies the fact that
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.080]   I
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.600]   I think this is great in a lot of ways, right? It's like so many people out there have talent, right?
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.320]   We're all pretty cool that way. Um, not all I'm tone deaf, but
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.480]   Yes, you are so many other people have talent
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.640]   Um, and I think that's that's remarkable that we could celebrate that without it becoming
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.800]   this like
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.480]   Celebrity I know that that's kind of everybody wants that but I think it's kind of awesome that we can we can all give that to
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.640]   people for a little bit and then go back to
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.480]   Our lives and it takes a lot more than just talent to be
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.560]   Uh an entertainer as it were I think well you look at Sarah Cooper for example, right?
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.960]   And and so she's got that delicate moment where she hid it she'd been trying to be a comedian for years
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:45.040]   Um, uh, she hits it big with one stick and now she doesn't want to be known for that stick and how does she you know extend her career? It's hard
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.360]   Yeah
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   Speaking of talent. Can I just do a quick?
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:55.840]   Go ahead. Is this a ball Brad to know it's Amanda gorman today at the inauguration?
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:03.360]   Gosh, oh our new poet and a young poet loriah. She was amazing 22 years old
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.320]   What presence and and and and sense of the language
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:16.000]   As poetry that I hadn't heard before I just was I was just blown away. Yeah. Yeah, and 20 what two years old
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.080]   23 there is um, hold on
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.080]   Oh where to go there's all these great teachers guides now for
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.400]   The poet the poem already. Um, so really?
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.280]   Yeah, so I actually
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.480]   Um, I actually bookmarked one so I kid Anna and I could talk about it
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.240]   Um because she wants to be a poet and she's all you know social justice is her channel. They'll be capitalists. Yeah
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.840]   Yeah pbs pbs.org has a
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.320]   lesson plan
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.800]   On the poem it includes, you know, a reading it includes a text it includes
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.600]   Formal curriculum about it. So here i'll pop it in something. Where would you like me to put it?
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:06.320]   Uh, where's our stuff scrolling scrolling scrolling other
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.720]   There we go. They didn't do this at the spur of the moment obviously
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.200]   No, it was coming
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.440]   Yeah, that's pretty amazing. That's really amazing
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   And by the way, what's all about it too?
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.680]   Gaga
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.680]   She sang pretty well. I don't know if I liked her outfit, but she sang very well
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.640]   She that was a beautiful I agree with you. That was a beautiful
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.480]   It was a great round of line to catch a rewind of all this stuff. Do you didn't you didn't get to see? Oh, you had to work
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.240]   That's right. You were doing uh
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.720]   Floss weekly. I totally thought it was tomorrow telling jamerby this morning
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.320]   Um because he was like, hey, all right. We have a new president. I was like what?
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.240]   And that's it that's tomorrow. It's just on its nose right now
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:58.720]   And I totally forgot but I think just both things are up online. Yeah, everything's online
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.480]   This in today's world you can watch it even if you weren't there and you could pretend right
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:11.040]   So here's uh, you know every time we get a new president since I think this goes back to when obama wanted to
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.680]   Uh use his blackberry in 2008 and they said no, yeah
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.280]   You have to use this crappy windows phone because it's secure
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.040]   uh
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.200]   the latest one is uh
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.280]   president biden has a peloton
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.240]   We talked about this at our show
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.280]   presidential peloton
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.720]   presidential peloton
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.600]   He's a must be in great shape because apparently every morning
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.960]   He go he used to I guess he'll have this in the white house now
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.240]   But he'd go to his gym where he has a peloton
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.080]   a uh
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.840]   treadmill and waits and works out every morning very impressed
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.360]   The heel is president. Yeah peloton is an internet connected a spin cycle where they have
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.040]   Uh classes both live and recorded that you can participate in on your peloton
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.000]   And it you know watches your heart rate and your and how much you're doing and all that stuff
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.640]   I didn't realize I have a peloton too and I didn't realize I think in the earliest days of peloton because
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.960]   They they could
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.600]   You could be in the class. They could see you and hear you
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.920]   Because this tablet which is an android tablet that's on the peloton
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.400]   And I after I read this article I said wait a minute
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.240]   I went and looked at mine and it does indeed have a camera and a microphone on it
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.920]   But I've never used that and that's apparently the concern
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.320]   Cybersecurity experts are concerned that the chinese or the russians
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.480]   Might be listening in the white house gymnasium
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:43.040]   Um, so but i'm sure that if they could they could take that windows ce phone and make it secure
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:50.480]   They can uh they can make that uh the president's peloton peloton can it manufacturer special so what?
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.400]   Yeah, I would imagine they'd be put it either
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.040]   You put some tape over the camera. That's a pretty good start
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:00.640]   Maybe clip the wire that leads to the microphone. I think you're you're done. So um
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.680]   But that's going to void the warranty can't do that
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.640]   apparently
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   I did not know this but uh
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.160]   Lauren good in uh on the verge mentioned
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.880]   We have in a review of peloton that's uh somebody close to the company
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:22.640]   Told her michelle obama had a modified peloton without a camera or a microphone in the white house
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.440]   So it's not what i'd be won't even be the first peloton in the white house
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.200]   Um
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.800]   Peloton did not realize its machines are prone to risks according to popular mechanics on a security and compliance page
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.680]   On the company's website peloton says no matter how much effort we put in a system security
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.960]   There can still be vulnerabilities present
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.760]   Well, that's true of everything
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.480]   Yeah, that's actually a responsible way to treat security. Yeah
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.560]   We just don't know how it's going to break yet, but we're looking out for it. Yeah
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.080]   Right now biden is swearing in a point. He's in a virtual ceremony and it's not zoom
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.240]   But it's something similar and god knows what can happen
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.960]   you can you can
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   swear in bob
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.200]   Yeah, yeah wouldn't that be weird?
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.960]   um
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   Any in any event I I encourage him to continue his exercise routine. That's a good thing
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.240]   Uh bring your peloton come on
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.880]   his uh pick speaking of nominees his pick for the security and exchange
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.880]   commission head gary gensler is an interesting pick because he is a crypto
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.760]   expert
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:42.560]   Yeah, I don't like crypto people. I'm worried about that. I just I just I like like BMW drivers. He's he's a former really
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.960]   There was so much wrong with that
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:57.360]   Gensler is a former banker served in the treasury department headed the commodities and future trading commission
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.880]   uh in 2018 he joined mit to teach courses about blockchain technology
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.840]   And as an advisor to the media labs digital currency initiative
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:14.880]   He predicted in his 2018 speech that unlike bitcoin digital tokens ether and xrp exhibit
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.440]   Characteristics of a security even though their cases are different. You know, I think it's a very good thing to have the head of the scc
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.120]   At least knowledgeable about these things, but you gotta admit you know a lot of
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.160]   Uh obnoxious crypto bros, right? Oh god. Yes. Yes. That's all I'm saying
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.600]   Jeff, I know a lot of what makes a little obnoxious white guys
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.800]   Well, you know, at least are you are you say is
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.120]   I'm just making a point about generalizations
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:47.280]   I think a lot of people. How about BMW drivers?
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.080]   I drive a BMW. Well, I
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:53.200]   You got you. Yeah
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.960]   We are the enemy
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.120]   He what is what did pogo say we have met the enemy and he is us
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   Yes
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.280]   The the blacklist with um
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.920]   China that that
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:16.560]   Picked my interest a little bit especially with more information from the new jami phones and it's just another piece of hardware
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.920]   That we'll never get over here in the u.s. Did you see that? This is interesting. Yeah, this is a trump's commerce department. So
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.800]   Unknown, uh, you know, obviously
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.040]   Just because there's a new administration doesn't mean all this stuff gets wound back
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.840]   but the commerce department added
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.320]   Xiaomi
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.360]   to the Chinese military blacklist saying
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.840]   Xiaomi and another manufacturer of planes komak were
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.720]   in effect the Chinese military and
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:54.720]   So that they're part of a new u.s. Investment ban which forces american investors to dis divest their holdings by november 11th
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.640]   Of this year
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.960]   Um, I'm not sure, you know the Huawei ban the Xiaomi ban
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.040]   Um, I don't you know, I don't know how much impact
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.280]   They had shalmies a phone company. They don't make 5g infrastructure. So
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:14.960]   They make a lot of connected devices for the smart home. They do make iot devices. That's right. Yeah
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:22.880]   So and the other thing is like to ya for example in the iot is the baseline for like a lot of walmart's connected gear
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:28.240]   Um, we haven't seen anything against that but i've talked to vendors who are like, yeah, we're not gonna use to you right now
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.680]   That whole thing with china is a problem. So I feel like
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.520]   I don't know what I feel like I feel like going to sleep
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.240]   Have you
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.200]   I feel like we have when we have options out there for especially like the phone geeks out there
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.920]   They love just getting their hands on the latest greatest phones
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.160]   We we saw what sam san could offer from the photable technology last year in the year before and to this day
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.360]   I still think the Huawei phone was the the better one that I had my hands on and yet
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.440]   It's something that I would never be able to get right here in the us and then with what's going on with shalmi
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.920]   That's another option of flagship devices. That's not at that
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.920]   flagship pricing of well over a thousand dollars for a phone
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.640]   That's just something else that we are continuing to miss out on is um us consumers
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.440]   Yeah, we had a jow me item on our gift list this year
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:27.600]   It was the me smart desk lamp and it was great and so inexpensive
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:33.360]   If you uh if you go to the new website for white house dot gov
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.080]   It had the changeover has occurred
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.280]   There's a picture of the new president the new vice president
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:45.120]   And if as many do because it's a fun thing to do you view source
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.520]   On the page
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.640]   You'll notice a comment right up top if you're reading this
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.680]   We need your help building back better
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:01.840]   usds.gov/apply which is a very familiar URL for anybody who watches our shows because of course
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.040]   That's the united states digital service headed by matt cuts
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.040]   That's pretty awesome plugs it every time he's on this show and on twit
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:15.280]   And then now he's plugging it on the white house website. John you said there's a picture of a crab in there too
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.400]   I haven't I haven't found that yet
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.080]   Um
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.240]   What is a crab like an asking crab and ask he crab somebody said uh, well, I think that's rusts
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:32.720]   Uh, the rust language is a mess though. So but I haven't found that in the source code
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   But that has become the thing to do by the way
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.160]   To hide stuff like this in the source code
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.920]   Because there's something about geeks. We just like to view source
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:50.000]   So, uh, I don't know if matt cuts did it, but uh, it's clearly a plug for matt cuts united states digital service. There's the crab
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.840]   Oh, okay. There is the crab. I don't know if that's a restation crab
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:01.040]   Um, that's cool. I don't know. God bless matt. He has he kept his head down and he's I hope he's saying there
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.840]   Yeah, I hope so too. We need him. Yeah, he can he can fix the darn vaccine signups
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.400]   Hmm
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.240]   Well, is there even a federal thing? No, but maybe maybe there's a lot of there were
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:20.240]   Yeah, well, there's not a federal distribution program. So it wouldn't make sense for the first that you got to establish that first
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.120]   Yeah, yeah, Washington state has a a
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:29.440]   Phase something checker, but i'm so far i'm gonna be like the last person to get vaccinated
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:35.920]   So it laughed at me when I checked. Oh, I get it. This is on the this is on the usds
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.920]   Website the source code on the usds site
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:49.280]   Um, and and actually it's not the restation crab. It's molly the crab the unofficial mascot of the united states digital service
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.520]   It's apparently a crab a crab wielding lightsabers
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.520]   I
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:06.800]   Love it. I love it. That's gotta be matt cuts right there in a nutshell
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.480]   Matt you will get mad on i'll tell you what
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:17.440]   Make a note of that Jason we we should see if matt can come on to it anytime soon because i'd love to know
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.840]   How the transition affects or twig you just come on twig all the time. Yeah, yeah
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.800]   I probably won't be here next week. You can replace me with matt cuts. What are you gonna be doing? What you do
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.520]   It's a day before my migraine shot. So i'm usually like dying. Oh
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.000]   It gets worse and worse as you go up
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.720]   Come up to it on it
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.160]   I'm sorry. Let me cheer you up brat brave
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.280]   The browser brave has added support
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.320]   See how this would cheer you up for the interplanetary file system
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.520]   IP F s i p f s what is i cfs Stacy? Um
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.480]   It powers the distributor web. Um, it's just a peer-to-peer
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:09.440]   Data sharing storage protocol. So it's it's like peer-to-peer
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:16.400]   We would say dns. I mean it's but it's also has it's not just where to it's where to store stuff where to find stuff
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:23.120]   Um, and i'll tell you the tell you the value of hers not her was like bit torrent in some country. Yeah, for instance
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.000]   Uh, wikipedia is blocked
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:34.400]   Right because you might read about tenem and square following gong or something like that. Right. So there is an ipf s version of wikipedia
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.680]   That cannot be blocked
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.600]   And people can find it if they're running running the
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.080]   Yeah, if you're using an ipf s enabled application, you can find it and now brave the brave browser is one of them
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.080]   So you can enter ipf s
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.120]   Uh colon slash slash instead of http colon slash slash
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.560]   And uh, I guess it would be wikipedia.org. I'm not sure what follows that so
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.320]   Because by the way in turkey they're blocking wikipedia they have for years. So there'll be a good
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:12.240]   I every ten years. I get so excited. I'm like now we're gonna have a really distributed web
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.040]   I seriously do and so I feel like
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.280]   I'm
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.720]   cautiously optimistic that this may be the moment we have both the technology we have the political impetus
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:30.640]   We have tech savvy people maybe out there and we have a backlash against the big platforms. Do we have the business models?
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.280]   Well, I hope you're right. I'm just wondering about that. How do we?
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:42.320]   That's the question. So the question, I mean you get you get smaller companies trying to differentiate themselves. Do I ever think
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.280]   How does it tip over into the mainstream?
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.160]   Once you get to the mainstream then it gets kind of corrupted for business models and I and I don't mean
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.360]   I mean that's that's what happened to the internet itself, right? So then I think you move to something else
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.880]   um
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.360]   So no one uses like napster or bit torrent really much anymore
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.200]   um
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:10.960]   And the reason is because people saw the light and they moved their official content into places that made it more easy and accessible for people
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.760]   Who wanted to get it to get it in a way that was almost what they wanted, right?
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.920]   They just had to pay but not as much as they used to so I think that kind of always happens
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.160]   but
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.160]   I I think we're ready for that
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.240]   In a much more wide widely
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.520]   I would love a far more federated architecture to so many things. Yes
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.960]   Well and as ant said it's like bit torrent with bit torrent
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.040]   Uh many people can host content and you can download it from slices from a bunch of different people
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.280]   That's exactly how ipfs works
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.760]   So you don't have to go to wikipedia.org to get your copy of wikipedia
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.120]   Many many people may be hosting snapshots of it
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:53.680]   Uh, and then you can potentially get it faster on your side. It might even be faster
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.080]   That's you know, certainly bit torrent. That was the promise
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.040]   That's how we distributed our shows before we got to a cdn before got cash lilies bit torrent
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.440]   Well, it's also the hope I have for adjax
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.520]   blue sky
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.320]   Well is that is that you add is that if you like wordpress if you have a an open
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.800]   Uh software layer even an open data layer, then you add value on top of that
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.160]   That's a better model
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.040]   Uh, I think you know something like that exists already for twitter that's masted on and again
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.240]   I'll just give a big plug for twit.social because it's exactly how it works. It's federated
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:34.400]   You know, uh one of the advantages and disadvantages is anybody can make a mastodon instance. So there's a gab
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.360]   Mastodon that gab is on mastodon
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.960]   But I as a host of a mastodon instance can block it. I you know, I don't want any nazis on my
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.760]   uh using my uh, so my
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.840]   Twitter social so I just block it
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.760]   um, so you have you
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.320]   Every individual has control over what they see and what they don't see just like twitter
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.120]   You can follow anybody on any other mastodon server unless that server is blocked
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.040]   Um, it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. It's exactly what
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.440]   Twitter will never do because the reason you knock a c twitter do that is because
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.160]   It undermines their entire
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.200]   Advertising business right there is no business anymore if twitter doesn't control it
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.240]   So that's why you need a central twitter
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.920]   Site as opposed to distributed twitter sites. So I don't know how
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.520]   Committed jack is to that. Do you know any more about that jeff is?
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.680]   No, I think he's mentioned again recently and and I think it it
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.800]   What excites me about it isn't just the tactical end of it
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:40.560]   It's relocating where the value is and this goes to the to the discussion earlier about twitter and and social media and so on and
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.920]   Cory, if to my mind the value is not going to be in hosting people talking
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.120]   That's commodified already. Right too much of it already. Right?
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.840]   The value is in finding that which is worth listening to
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:58.560]   And you you can you can subscribe to a service that finds you good people i'm a subscribe to a different service that finds me people
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.200]   Um, and then i'll yell at you that your service isn't good enough because you're still complaining and then
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:09.040]   The discussion is on a different plane, right? So i'm i'm then paying for the value of
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.720]   um, maybe it's verification maybe it's it's it's
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.680]   Uh of people or facts or or things. Maybe it's curation
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.640]   Maybe it's it's not unlike david rumbnick of the new yorker finds the good writers who finds the good tweeters
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.640]   Is their value in that?
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.600]   And that to me is where it gets interesting. That's why i states about the business model piece because once you get it to a federated world
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.160]   uh, you know wordpress as
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.880]   What is it a third of the whole web?
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.000]   um
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.280]   But it's just a platform and the value isn't in that
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:46.480]   The value is at a higher level of service of of curation of creation. That's what i want to see us get to
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:55.200]   Yes, but as you start doing those things and people become reliant on them. They become the next platform
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.440]   That is that is technology and a nutshell right every layer of abstraction
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:07.680]   gets but but but but but you have the the opportunity don't just ac then to have to go into cori and and um
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:16.160]   What's his name? Who's our boss here leo's point? Uh, me you forgot me already. I forgot you for a second. Yeah, I try I tried
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.680]   um
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   Uh, you go to their point earlier of if you had more choices and so I don't think you end up with one
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.000]   Chooser of the best of twitter. I think you had multiple choosers
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.160]   But with tech unlike with like choices in like shopping
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.440]   um
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.760]   Think about it like if i'm shopping for food and I need i'm making a recipe for something
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.760]   And I need a can of tomatoes I can buy any number of tomatoes and I think you would like your your platforms to be like that
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.680]   But in tech what happens is if i'm choosing a recipe
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:56.480]   In it come what what happens is I end up choosing and integrating my stuff to other things to make a bigger service or more value
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:03.040]   Right and then suddenly my tomato has become linked to the type of cheese I use and all of this because of
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.200]   This is a really stretched analogy. Yeah, you're going to be here. Go ahead
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:14.000]   I i'm starting. I'm starting it's not as interchangeable in tech because you have to tie so many things together
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.480]   And that's here's my argument. I don't think it's tech stays
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.920]   It is so like there was a rest. Hold it. Hold it. Hold on. Let me finish my thing. Let me give you a tech analogy
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.320]   My my blog runs on WordPress my podcast blog runs on WordPress
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.840]   I
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:34.320]   Have a service that I syndicate or that that hosts my podcast and then I use a syndication service that
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:39.440]   Pulls my podcast to my blog and then also syndicates it to all the RSS feeders
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.320]   if I change
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.160]   Not WordPress. Well, if I change WordPress, I have to change a bunch of other things down the line
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:50.640]   So it's harder. It's less fun to do and if I change maybe one of the many
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.160]   Podcast syndication or link services on WordPress
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.280]   I then have to go change it elsewhere in it is still very complicated
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.760]   So the network affects the integrations all make it very hard to switch
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.720]   It's not
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.240]   prohibitive but
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.280]   Well, it is prohibitive, but it's not the end of the world and I can't do it
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.040]   Okay, so let me just look at the other
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.240]   I take your point from the creator end from the public end
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.640]   Right because I helped start Epicurious back in the day. We thought we've got gourmet
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.920]   We got bought app. We got all the recipes you could possibly want who could possibly compete with this
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:27.760]   Bingo all recipes, you know, bingo tons and tons and tons of services because recipes
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   We thought our gourmet recipes were valuable. We're actually made invaluable was the
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.240]   public coming in and improving them
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.680]   and the layer of value changed immensely
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.880]   I'd say if those recipes are way too complicated. No one wants those all recipes are like
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:48.080]   Dubacana soup on some pasta put it in the oven. Well, that's why all recipes succeeded. Yes, exactly
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.960]   Right. But that's actually a really interesting point
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   So there's an effort right now
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.760]   Like recipes are one of those weird places on the web that are incredibly stagnant because
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:04.160]   There's not a like an html or an xml for recipes, right? We don't have we don't have a standard for that
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.800]   So I can only get my recipes on like the internet, right?
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:16.480]   I can't pull them other places like my fridge or my oven or my even google assistant very easily because or your june oven, right?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.000]   Yeah, right you weren't here. We talked about that being purchased by
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.920]   Very excited. You think that's a good thing? I do the Weber guys built they they've used june os really well
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:33.920]   And they I've met I've met there. Okay. I talked to the Weber folks about good to hear what they're doing
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:38.560]   So yeah, I'm really actually I really wanted to get your take on that. So I'm glad you mentioned it now you have it
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.360]   Yeah, I'm sorry to meet interrupt, but I wanted to
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.320]   I mean that was that's the point
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.040]   Here's a picture of matt cuts in a crab costume
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.360]   And now for something completely different what he does
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.440]   Beautiful. I'll be loved. Oh, you do love him
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:02.800]   So what are you? Okay? I'm really curious because I've been reading a lot and I I have again mixed feelings about this
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.680]   uh two weeks ago to the to the day
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.600]   uh
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:14.640]   There was as you know an invasion of the us capital by a number of demonstrators many of whom were armed
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:19.600]   Uh, some of whom were chanting killed the vice president or gancy Pelosi
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:23.360]   Uh, there have been many arrests, but one of the things law enforcement has done
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.480]   Is put out calls to social media help us identify
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.640]   Uh, this person or that person they're using face recognition
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.840]   They're using you're doing all the things that we've had qualms about in the past. They're using
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.040]   uh
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.360]   cell phone geographic location gps data because of course
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:48.400]   If you were in the uh capital building between one and two in the afternoon
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.080]   on uh
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.000]   On that wednesday. Well pretty good chance you uh you were part of that group
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.080]   so, um
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.280]   What do you all think about it? Do we know if do we know if the fbi is subpoena that uh geo location data with it?
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.360]   I mean because to say
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.040]   Hey
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.360]   We'll actually know I guess know who was in this area
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.840]   I mean
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.240]   I mean you could presume obviously some people were there innocently or maybe you were a reporter
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.520]   They're covering it. No, but you don't want to scoot people up in those that does feel incredibly fraud
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.320]   Well, I've been looking through some of the indictments
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:30.720]   And it's really it's really interesting. So you know, it's had to have all the fun remember. Yeah so much fun remember
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.680]   uh
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.680]   For a long time police have been looking for
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.160]   uh, remember one officer was
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:42.960]   There's graphic video of him being crushed in a doorway. Yeah, right? Uh, they have arrested
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.080]   Uh somebody who allegedly was doing that and I was going through the pleading
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.680]   Uh, and it's really interesting because it is
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.120]   Layden with pictures from social media
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.240]   pictures, uh from youtube
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.600]   Selfies that he shot
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.320]   YouTube videos that he shot
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.280]   And yes, there's a cell phone location information in here that they cite
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.360]   This is this is the actual video of the officer being crushed
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.320]   Um, but pulling the stuff from social media that he posted there that features him
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.560]   I don't think that's not a problem
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.000]   He posted some of he didn't he's in it. Oh, well still. I mean, he's he's in a public place
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.120]   He's in a public place committing a crime. Yeah, that's so tough. How about putting out
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.760]   Uh, the video and saying hey, who's this anybody know?
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:39.360]   I think that's I think that's morally difficult. We don't have laws against it
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.320]   I mean, it's kind of like the opposite of revenge porn in some ways, right?
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.160]   Well, stay is it any different from the point in the post office and you have the 10 most wanted
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:53.440]   Well, that's kind of similar to that. Yes, because it's searchable and it lasts for as long as it lasts on the internet
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.160]   So I do think there are actually differences there
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.960]   I've not seen you use of official subpoenas for this information from the different cell phone carriers out there
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.880]   Did you was I I didn't but they pulled it when I'm just saying hey, can y'all help us out? I don't see anything
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.960]   Different from like mr. Jarvis said just putting up the wanted pictures up in public is the same approach
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.240]   so no because they I mean
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.400]   It's it's like if they went and asked you for your I mean
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.800]   They asked you for your photos like hey everybody at a high school
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:34.800]   There was some murder here during the assembly if anyone has pictures during the assembly. Can you share them? That's different what you're saying?
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.760]   And there's different
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.800]   What is what is getting people's if the stuff is already public and and what i'm saying is hey
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.960]   This is already out there. You know who it is?
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.640]   That's what i'm saying
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.720]   I still think that's I still think that's okay
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:53.920]   I think that's okay too. Yeah using facial recognition on those images and like pulling them against databases
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.760]   Like all your like driver's license database that gets a little dicey
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.240]   I'm still iffy on that part of it
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:05.120]   The AI but i'm not saying that was down here. I'm just saying that that's that's a little more
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.280]   Yeah, but I tweeted as soon as this happened
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:10.000]   Provocatively knowing we were talking about it here that gee
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.240]   I wonder if any attitudes toward facial recognition change after a coup on the country
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.880]   Um, the other issue obviously is is the misidentification the the screw-ups
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.200]   That's where your right stacey that things can be damaging. I just put up the bottom of other
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.480]   technology review put up a guide to
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.200]   ethical online investigation
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:34.080]   Ethical traffic is a portage. Oh, that's good. That's really good. Yeah, right. I haven't read it yet
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.600]   I just I just found it the other thing that's interesting to me is here's here's another
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.920]   You know twist on this
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:44.400]   Politico and not political pro publica took all of the parlor videos
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:48.320]   and then put them up and um
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.920]   Uh put them in timelines and locations
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:57.120]   Superb job. It's some it's a somewhere. I don't know what line number it is. Oh, it's somewhere in the in the thing
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.960]   But it's really quite amazing
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:04.400]   Uh, now I don't know what the of course we know the circumstance by which the parlor stuff was all scraped because parlor was an idiot about it
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.920]   Um
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.360]   Were those things up there for small groups were they up there public in parlor?
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.800]   I don't know. Well, that's the problem. Yeah parlor had really secured it. I think they've got everything which includes
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:18.400]   Yeah, whatever that's that's uh, that's using a bad platform
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.200]   That's like when your journalist takes your picture and the geolocation data is on their picture and then the feds find you
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.800]   That's not trusting the right platform right there
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:31.600]   Which I would say you're going to play in insurrection
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.640]   You probably should be on a pretty secure platform
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.600]   What are idiots? They're freaking idiots
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:44.320]   Again, uh, we can be very grateful that they were not not very competent. Yeah, exactly exactly
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.280]   Could have been a lot uh a lot worse
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.640]   Amen
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.320]   Uh
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.400]   You want you want a light moment here a light moment? Yeah
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.720]   Bernie memes
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.600]   I love these mitten memes now. Where did the mittens come from?
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.040]   Uh, it was a woman. It was a teacher who evidently did it for him and he wore them where?
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.920]   At the inauguration
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.640]   Fastest abbation this was for this morning
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:17.120]   Uh, Bernie sitting wearing these mittens and now they're putting him everywhere in fact. There's a sticker already
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:24.240]   It's just the greatest here he is in that line of workman, uh building new york
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.360]   You gotta love the internet man. You got a lot of it

[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.760]   Yeah, you know, it's partly because his his attitude and there's a sure a t-shirt already
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.720]   Here he is
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:47.040]   I don't know in the boondish stock. I don't know here. He is in the hall of mirrors in verisai

[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:56.000]   Oh, yeah, he was part of this very important photograph
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.960]   His mittens
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:04.480]   They're pretty cute. I'm gonna say oh and this happens of course all the time to me when I wear mittens
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:07.120]   Uh, the very famous meme
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:12.720]   So bernie is this is how he was dressed. It was apparently very cold. It was a snowing for part of it
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:19.920]   So he's he's wearing his snow suit and some big knitted mittens and he's sitting with his legs crossing his arms crossed
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:25.280]   and uh, you know, okay, great killed man life is like a box of chocolates and just

[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:29.280]   This this was I think the first one I saw he just said the table selling the sound CDs the back of the concert hall
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:33.520]   merch concert merch got it here get your t-shirts here
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:39.360]   There he is the fly on pence's pence's head. Yeah. Yeah, he was at the debate people

[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.920]   like
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.040]   10 o'clock joe's thing 11 o'clock run by post office
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.280]   on one of those special chair elevators they sell
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:01.600]   All right, he's on the beach with oh wait a minute
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.440]   This is actually on the inaugural stand chris christie's decided to join him in the beach chair. That's good
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.240]   That's a reverse meme. That's a reverse one. Yeah
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.600]   So stacy you see this is this is where
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:19.520]   Um going back to the prior discussion. This is where the unlimited creativity is so wonderful
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.120]   Now there's no business model behind any of that but people did it for joy and love
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.480]   And the question is how do you give credit for that if you wanted to to encourage that?
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.120]   How do you create business models around that? I don't know, but it's it's fun
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.240]   This is the freedom. I mean we see this it's obviously out there and people are doing it
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.960]   Yeah, that's great
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.360]   You're gonna have to make I mean
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:46.640]   You have to make it easy for people to find things that they I mean any of us who like used to alt of easter
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.560]   Remember the original yahoo pay or yeah yahoo pages like I mean
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:56.160]   You have to even if you have like a distributed system
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.160]   You're gonna need to find ways to
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:06.560]   Get people to see what you're building. I mean, I don't know how else to tell you jeff there businesses
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.920]   Gonna be a new book. It's a bit of where wall though. Where's wall those? Where's bernie?
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.200]   Oh, we got the copyright trouble. This is the last that's the last supper
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.520]   Yeah, the last supper in there he is you want audio. Yeah, yeah, I feel bad if you're an audio you're missing all the fun
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.680]   Um because it's just the perfect bernie pose. It's it's everything. It's the mittens. It's the pose
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:37.680]   It's the whole thing. It's his personality. It's the whole thing. Uh, it's just look. Here's a guy actually selling
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.640]   a kid
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.200]   Look
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:50.320]   Still his look you can't quite get those mittens though because those are those are handmade handcrafted
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.680]   Made by they're not mittens
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.280]   Are they don't know? These are gloves
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:03.680]   He's wearing mittens. He's made by jenn ellis a teacher from s6 jen junction vermont who gave him to him
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.320]   Two years now two years ago
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.440]   She was surprised when he began wearing them on the campaign trail
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:16.080]   They're made from repurposed wool sweaters in lined with fleece made from recycled plastic bottles
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.040]   Of course, of course
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:28.160]   Oh golly, I love it. I'm glad we can happy happy again. We can we can be joyous
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.720]   happy again
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.280]   I think this would be a good time to do
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.400]   Our google change log you all up for it. Okay, sure but first
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.160]   I gotta get the musicians
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.680]   Ladies and gentlemen
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.160]   the google change log
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.000]   For this day january 20th 2021
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.360]   chrome 88 big update
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.920]   You can now edit saved passwords. Don't know why you want to do that
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:09.840]   Maybe mess with somebody edit saved passwords. There's a new UI for granting permissions, you know, they change the UI
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.840]   That's okay. Maybe it's a little bit clearer
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.080]   um
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.560]   Let's see what else?
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.560]   The next one is part of that
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:24.800]   You can uh, tp dies. Yeah, they take an ftp colon slash slash out
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:31.920]   Um, there's a lot. There's a lot you actually uh, steve gibson talked about the new chrome as well
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.680]   No more support for macos 10 10.10. That's over
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:43.040]   And no more ftp. That's right because how many people use their browser to do ftp really
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:46.880]   Really like four people. Yeah, come on you can
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:52.000]   Better dark theme support if you like dark like jeff jarvastas. He loves the dark
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:59.360]   Uh, no more legacy browser support for uh add-ins
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.240]   So but that's actually because it's built in so they don't have to you don't have to add a plugin for that
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.520]   Less intrusive permission requests anyway, we can go on and on but you know what if you're using chrome
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.800]   You're going to get a the a whether you like it or not new shortcuts
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.680]   With google docs
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.200]   I use shortcuts in google docs all the time
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:27.680]   Um shortcuts that go beyond the basic options already built into the service give you a more slack like command line driven method
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.000]   According to jr. F. L and android uh intelligence column and computer world
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.800]   um
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.040]   He says they totally change the way you use google docs
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.680]   Okay, I don't know
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.680]   Wait a minute. This is this is a chrome extension. Never mind
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.120]   Never mind you have to install the extension. So forget it forget it. This is how you would do it
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.600]   But it's not from google. So never mind
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.920]   How did it make it into the change law? It's an error error and forget I say anything think I put it in there
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.000]   No, I'm should be idea
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.720]   Gmail now lets you resize google chat and rooms in the website bar. I'm just reading them
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:17.280]   Okay, google cuts off access. Oh, this was a problem people were using google chrome sync in their open source chromium
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.080]   browsers and that was a problem because it's a private chrome
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.840]   API it's not part of the open source. So it is no longer
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:34.000]   Possible in chromium to use that was unintentionally supported. Yeah, I think I think it was excellent. No, I think it was accidental
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.320]   Um, and it was and it was potentially security hazard
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:43.760]   So I don't I think that they discontinued it not because they didn't want people to use it
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:49.520]   Because the sync had some potential side effects the google play store has icons now
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:52.240]   that show you how
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.120]   The app is doing on the charts kind of like with a bullet
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.080]   You know at like and they used to do in a billboard. It's number one with a bullet
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.000]   Um, see these little these little graphs. It's going up. It's going down. It's going up. It's going down
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.680]   I don't know if anybody cares about this at all, but
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.600]   Hey, it's a challenge and we're logging it. You're right. It's changed. It's what we do is change. We log them
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.840]   They happen. We log them
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:25.360]   Uh, winter's seasonal savings a new feature. You might know about this in nest thermostats stacy
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.560]   So yes, yes
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.200]   It'll it'll try to help you lower your bill. Good. Thank you
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.400]   Yay
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.680]   Hey
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.680]   Winter's almost over but okay
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.320]   No, isn't it? It was 80 degrees yesterday. Oh, you live in the pacific northwest. Yeah
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:50.160]   I was like it will not be over to like July. You're always just always cold now. And they're juicy. Is it still cold?
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.000]   We got about two more weeks, right? Yeah, we're almost done. Yeah. Yeah. No
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.080]   Yeah, I mean up in like up in the northeast. It's also like you don't get warm until April. Yeah, I know
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.600]   I know
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.600]   That's why i'm here. Yeah
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.920]   Uh, google's previewing new alarms with your nest hub
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:14.320]   Uh, yeah, and the sunrise I haven't tried this yet, but I use it in this tub for my alarm. I love it that little
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.960]   cameraless one
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.200]   And uh, they're gonna have this sunrise feature
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.240]   Which I guess will kind of ramp up the
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:25.600]   It'll it'll start they just hadn't had one other
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.280]   Companies have them
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.160]   So it lets you take any of your smart lights that are tied to your google assistant that happened to be in your bedroom
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.040]   And it will like let you set those to go off
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   And gradually lighten if they're dimmable
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.320]   And you can also they would also do that with a screen on the google hub
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:48.080]   Yeah, it's nice. Um, I just like it that I can shout stop
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:54.720]   I do yeah, we shout a lot. I kind of feel like we're getting a little rude. We're like stop it
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.800]   Much more detail
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.680]   In google maps
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.680]   streets and nature
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.760]   Are getting more detail
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:12.640]   Uh exploring a place gives you a look at its natural features so you can easily distinguish tan
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:18.560]   arid beaches and deserts from blue lakes rivers oceans and ravines
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.680]   You can know at a glance how lush and green a place is with vegetation
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:31.200]   Okay, is that more for like doing ai for things like, you know how they're trying to detect how what areas need more trees?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.360]   Maybe yeah, is that like a byproduct or it's a little different
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:42.880]   We look at them episodes here from image one this park. That's the old way image to the park
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.160]   See, it's a little bit more you can see a little bit more detail and its color
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.480]   Same thing here with the paths and so forth. I guess it's you know, it's a subtle. It's a subtle. They're doing their job
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.120]   But improving it right here. Yeah, that's what they do. Yeah, you do it. Well, yeah
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.280]   I still love the the feature where if you're just going through town and it gives you landmarks
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.320]   Hey, you need to turn right at the so-and-so building
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.200]   Which is street so-and-so instead of because sometimes you can't see street signs
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.520]   But you can see that big building right there is already going to say okay. I do need to turn there
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.480]   I haven't driven anywhere in 10 months
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.880]   Really? No, I have used that far either, but I remember I remember using that feature
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.320]   Like you remember when we used to use maps because we didn't know where we were
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.360]   Now I never go anywhere
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.760]   Nope
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.760]   You really haven't driven in 10 months
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.320]   Um
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.000]   As good. I've been in New York City once he has allowed to go to the drugstore
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.960]   I've been in the doctor a couple times
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:51.280]   Do you walk in New Jersey or where we live? No, I drive but that's it. I said 10 months. It's not a lot
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:57.600]   Yeah, I bought okay. I've eaten in one restaurant in 10 months once yeah, right
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.960]   And you regretted it and I regretted it immediately. Oh, yeah, you get sick. No, that's not how I got sick
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:11.600]   I just felt like boy. I think that might have been a dumb thing to do. It wasn't as it turned out, but uh, yeah, I am
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.360]   I'm getting a new car and I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna drive around in a circle. I guess in the driveway
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.480]   But do you get it? Uh in about a month valentine's day
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.640]   Oh
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.440]   Yep, you're moustache my moustang moustang
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:29.520]   Uh
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.520]   Better than driving to bmw
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:35.440]   Oh much or a tesla. I got her beat both come coming and going
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.920]   The google story has no longer to sell the type c
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.720]   pixel earbuds
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.360]   Everybody's gone wireless. You know what? I cherish these
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.240]   Along with my lightning uh air pods
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.840]   They're not air pods. Whatever they call those headphones
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.520]   I'll be because I still like to connect direct
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.640]   And uh, so I have a pair of these
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.560]   Given the google's wireless ones never freaking terrible. Yeah, I'm not I don't like bluetooth that much for headphones
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.120]   Anyway, I have a pair but I now I won't be able to get any more. They were only 30 bucks. They were cheap
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:11.760]   But the google has stopped selling them
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.960]   Uh without a replacement. I might add it's all wireless and finally
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:19.520]   hitman
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.040]   three
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040]   lands on stadia
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:27.920]   And they finally added a feature they call state share
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:32.320]   Uh, what is state share? I don't know
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.840]   I don't know state share allows you to share your state. I guess
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.080]   I'm just sitting here at home. That's why state all the time. Don't change if you're a stadia person
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:48.160]   Yeah, if you're per stadia
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.840]   Oh, this was the thing that they were good you could on you were on youtube and you could share
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.840]   You could say join me in the game at this point and people could just join you right there
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.920]   Now I remember they were talking about that
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.480]   Let's you share your missions with friends
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.200]   So that's part of now hitman one and two and three
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.160]   And that's the google change
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.960]   All right, I'm gonna do one trump story because it's
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:19.040]   Mostly it's just a really good example of and the new york times have been so good at this
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.760]   uh, their digital content
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.560]   Um, oh man. It's not looking good right now. I gotta log in and then it will look better
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.200]   but they have taken
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.680]   All of the president former presidents tweets
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.000]   actually
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.160]   Twitter insults would be more accurate from the year 2015 and the years almost all the tweets anyway 2021
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.960]   And you can sort it alphabetically
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:53.040]   You can sort it chronologically. It's actually kind of cool. So, uh, you know, it's good to go to one like uh,
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.880]   joe biden because that'll
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.800]   Give you a lot of material
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.920]   And then you can see the this is chronological
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.560]   And then when you hover over the insult
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:05.520]   You could see the entire tweet
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.280]   This is an amazing record and it must have been a huge amount of work
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.320]   Yeah, is this really
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.040]   The best use really why is this your peeler surprise?
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.560]   Oh, yeah, well, maybe not a purel of surprise, but and i'm sure they did it programmatically
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.160]   But that's I mean, it's kind of cool. Don't you think?
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.880]   Maybe not
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:29.760]   Yeah
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.720]   I'm like
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:36.480]   I mean, I guess maybe somewhere sometimes someone might be like, oh, he wasn't that bad and then you can point to the side
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.840]   I just don't know
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.480]   Here is here's how you can you too can be banned from twitter just just an example
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.680]   So
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:50.000]   I I wanted to go back to to a story that I think some of our
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.080]   Regular folks would be interested in and that's the malware bite story online one. Yeah, so they were part of kind of sucked into
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.600]   the solar winds hack
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:08.560]   malware bites, which is widely used by both back-end windows users to eliminate malware from their systems
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.400]   It's not exactly an antivirus. It's more like a malware detector
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.840]   Apparently they were hacked using it looks like office 365
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.520]   uh
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.280]   and azure
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:24.160]   And but the bad guys the solar winds hackers
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.720]   Did not get anything but some internal emails and not even that many the fourth major security firm
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:36.320]   Targeted by the solar winds hackers microsoft fire eye and crowd strike and now
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:39.120]   malware bites
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.600]   Uh, they don't use solar winds. They said it didn't come from solar winds it came from
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.760]   uh a dormant email protection product within its office 365
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:53.920]   Wow, yeah
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   did y'all see brad smith's um
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.080]   Talk at virtual ces
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.920]   He he I mean he likened solar winds he kind of compared it to
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:09.200]   9/11 and he I mean he was he was pretty emphatic about
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:18.800]   About the impact of this and how unprecedented is for that type of attack to occur and how it's really an attack on
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:24.320]   But all we hold dear. He's microsoft's a chief legal officer and president. Yeah
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.480]   Yeah, and um
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.600]   Yeah, I think I think he's probably not wrong. The problem is and the reason I don't think you hear a lot about anymore
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.920]   A lot about it even though
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:38.320]   Uh, these bad guys probably uh the russian military uh intelligence
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:46.720]   Got into everything, you know, many government agencies many private companies is there's not much to do about it except go oh
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:54.240]   Right the actions need to be taken. I mean we just need to but his point is we shouldn't just
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:00.080]   Go away. We should say oh my gosh. This is like a new threat vector that we need to deal with as a people
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:03.120]   As a society. Yeah, although
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:11.680]   Uh, we're doing I'm sure we're doing it to them as fast as we can as hard as we can so it is it is an interesting issue
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:14.560]   you know, I
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:21.840]   Well, I don't know maybe I'm incredibly naive. Let's just not one of the last uh executive orders the president signed on his way out was in fact
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.840]   uh to prevent gives the commerce department authority to
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:28.160]   bar transactions
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:33.760]   With foreigners and cloud computing products or services if the foreigner uses it for cyber attacks
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:37.440]   Is this is the know your customer bill or know your customer?
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.360]   Uh order
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:43.280]   It's basically saying you need to know who's hosting on your company so you can
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:47.280]   Pritt so basically you could protect yourself. I don't actually think this is a bad thing
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.560]   No, I don't think it's a bad thing
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:51.520]   But I think it's closing the bar and door after the horse is gone
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.120]   Well, yes and no, I mean, yeah, you throw stuff. Well, yes, but people are
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.760]   But it's not sweeping it under the rug either, you know, right
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:02.160]   Sorry to interrupt Stacy
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:08.640]   No, I'm just like it'll stop the next way to I mean, that's how you have to deal with security like we said earlier when we're talking about
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:16.000]   A peloton security things. They know that someone's gonna figure something out. You just got to be aware of it and then take steps to
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.760]   You still have other horses in your bar. They have an all left. They're not all gone. That's true
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.320]   Let's close that door before the rest of them are over the horizon, but some are still there
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.400]   Slowans
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.560]   You're requires
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:37.040]   The commerce department to write rules in six months for us providers of infrastructure as a service
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:43.040]   Azure would be an example to verify the identity of foreigners with whom they do business
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:49.520]   And to keep certain records. So it's really a burden upon the american companies who have foreign customers
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.440]   right
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.440]   Okay, so i'm hurt
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:56.400]   I was hoping to find my
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:04.400]   My trump insult in the new york times, but it came before 2015 did he insult you? Oh, but i sold yeah, he's the only oh really
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.400]   They only kept them more recent in so
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.640]   He called me a terrible editor so
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:15.040]   Called you
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.360]   um
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.360]   Bill Cosby
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.760]   Yeah, that's the other one, yeah
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.600]   Um
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.600]   Make sure we add that to his lower third
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.640]   And be um
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:36.000]   I'm kind of sad pocket cast is now up for sale again
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.640]   They were purchased by public radio, which lost a ton of money on them
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.400]   Public radio being npr wnyc studios wb
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.840]   Or why this american life they well they used to charge three bucks for it
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.840]   And then when public radio this consortium bought it they stopped charging and actually uh, you know
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.600]   calmness
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:01.200]   Npr said that they lost 800 thousand dollars
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:07.360]   Their share their share alone of podcast media's net loss was 812 thousand dollars
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.600]   so
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.600]   What are they planning to do with it? I never fully ever
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.640]   There's a hot thing everybody had to have more podcast
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:20.160]   Yeah, lots of podcast, but what was the but podcast didn't make podcasts. It was just a podcast client. It didn't I know
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:22.480]   Yeah
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.800]   So there was an acquisition no apple says they're gonna create subscription podcast
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.800]   So I was curious about your thoughts on that did that happen this last week or would say that was a rumor apple hasn't confirmed it
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.800]   Okay
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.000]   But I think it's it's reasonable. They've hired a lot of people with podcast backgrounds
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000]   They basically just read your sub stack
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.600]   I don't know what you know, and I don't know what it would be
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.600]   We actually talked about this on neckbreak weekly
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.160]   Whether it would be more like an apple tv plus thing where they hire big name
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.920]   producers and stars to record audio to make audio content
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.160]   I don't think they would be doing shows like this, but who knows, you know, I don't know
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.440]   I don't know anyway. It's a game apple give you a call
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:08.880]   Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, somehow. I don't think apple is ever going to call me about anything
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:18.080]   So but it is you know as spotify and amazon and yes apple and are all investing in podcasting in somewhere or other
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:23.600]   I don't know what's going to happen to pocketcast. It's still my favorite podcast clients the only reason yeah, yeah
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:30.160]   Uh, but I use play a pod my friends app. That's because you're a player
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.720]   Not even close is it play a pod or ply a pod
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.840]   Playa pod play a pla ya pod. It's the best post it by my man
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:46.400]   Todd mora tms soft. Okay, that's it. There you go
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.120]   It was or if you brought it to burning man, you called the ply a pod
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:54.080]   I'm just saying
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.080]   I spoke with him over to weekend actually
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.840]   He's looking to move over to the the podcast directory
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:06.800]   Did I believe that i'm curry? Yeah, they just added podcast index support
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.600]   Uh, yeah, it's interesting
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:15.920]   I don't curry ever heard that name in a while getting out from under the apple reach, you know
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:21.840]   Yeah, I mean I guess somebody uh, you know like play a pod isn't going to make their own directory
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:30.240]   Right. Um, I don't know what pocketcast does so adam decided most of them are going most of them are scraping the apple side of it is my understanding
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.240]   Oh really? Oh, okay
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:34.480]   Yeah, I think that's you know
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:38.160]   The reason adam's doing it is because apple blocked
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.040]   Um, Alex jones
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:48.640]   And so he you know his old big thing is no censorship censorship. I see play a pod says the same thing no censorship, which um
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.320]   Okay, you know
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.680]   Fine
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:59.120]   I don't know if the world needs another let's let's not yeah
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.680]   I think it'd be a good time to do picks even though we stole your pick
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.840]   And you just take any of my you want to add any one of your
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:16.480]   And you can't always has a lot of picks so I'll let i'll let aunt pick another pick. What do you got for us?
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:22.400]   Oh my other one, uh, because I didn't I couldn't come up with the uh alternate to the one that was stolen
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:28.880]   So very near and dear to my heart and it's saying image this out there
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.440]   I don't know who to credit the image to i've asked I asked the person that posted this on twitter
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.800]   If they created the image because I wanted to give it give them credit
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:40.880]   But it's basically a salute to the heroes and if you look at it
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:44.000]   It is a depiction of some nurses
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:49.360]   Walking down a hallway and all of the uh comic book heroes are bowing down
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:54.400]   to these nurses walking in the hallway because they are working their
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.040]   their ears off and uh
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.200]   Fighting a good fight for everybody out there even the people that don't like them
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:08.560]   Yes indeed and I see you have a link to the hill we climb
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:14.240]   No, I didn't do that. Oh, maybe oh, no. Sorry. That was that was my thing. I put it in the wrong spot
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.480]   You you stuck the thing in the wrong spot. Well, lay me ladies and gentlemen. Let us give you
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:24.880]   Stacey's thing. Oh, well. No, this is the thing I told you about earlier. It could also be my
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:28.720]   Well, what is your thing if it's not? So the link is by the way
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:30.480]   to uh
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:34.480]   A discussion of Amanda Gorman's poem that once you read at the inauguration the hill we climb
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:40.800]   Which is very beautiful and uh, so and this is the text of the poem and her reading it, which is
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:45.760]   Fantastic. All right, and actually a study guide for students, which is actually great. I
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:52.400]   That's a great idea. Kids of a certain age like this is for six through 12. You could actually learn a lot
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:57.760]   It's a good conversation topic. Yeah, maybe not for everybody, but yeah, we were gonna use it
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:02.960]   Yeah, um, okay. You want to think yeah, I want a thing. I got something
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:06.160]   Y'all know I am obsessed with plants
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.560]   latest plant thing
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:11.920]   This is a $10 or a grow light you can buy on amazon
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:18.320]   Oh snap. Oh, wait, I'm gonna stop the weed jokes right now. Um, I'll show y'all. I am
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:23.200]   I'm right now. Let's see. Can you see incubating? Oh, look
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:25.840]   She's growing a little basil. Oh
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:33.680]   It's a br 30 light. So it's not an a 19 a traditional light bulb is one of the flatter ones, but you can stick this in a
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:38.640]   All over the place. I mean you can stick it in any sort of lamp and
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:46.240]   It gives normal looking light. It's it's kind of a daylight esque if you're talking about like color lighting colors probably at the
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.800]   3000 maybe even
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:52.960]   3500 range. Um, so a little wider, but
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.080]   It gives you the exact
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:02.640]   Type of light. It's it's the all spectrum full spectrum leds and when I measured my little lumens
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:04.720]   I have a little lumens sensor for my plants
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:12.800]   Um, it was given me enough if you're up close like at that level. I'm getting about 4500 lumens from it for my
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:16.080]   My little basil germinating seedlings
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:18.560]   Um, so it's 10 bucks
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:23.840]   Why wouldn't you do it? It's it's not connected, but you can I I had a drop it in the um
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:31.280]   Did you drop a link in in our rundown because queen prue it has been asking about grow lights and I said $10. I'm in
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.760]   Yeah, you know what my plan
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:36.160]   I'll add it
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.480]   Okay, here we click click clicking click click. I want to I actually was thinking of
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:47.360]   Building a greenhouse maybe even a hydroponic greenhouse outside so we can have like
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.200]   lettuces
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:54.960]   Justine was saying she's grown. She's got a vertical garden of lettuces and she says it's more lettuce than you could ever eat
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.560]   Oh, yeah, the vertical gardens are nuts, but you could only in a vertical garden. You can only grow lettuce
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:05.120]   Well, maybe not only lettuce, but not tomatoes, not cucumbers, not zucchini
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.040]   So I was thinking I would I want to just like a greenhouse
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:15.440]   I don't know maybe 15 by 8 something like that. We got a little room for it and uh, I could just
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:18.560]   Tomatoes year round zucchini things like that
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:21.120]   Um, I would like to do that. I would like to do that. I would like to do that
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.160]   like little
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:23.760]   the the
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.600]   Grow plant growing market is ridiculously saturated right now
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:31.440]   You can actually buy a very cute greenhouse. That's a good time. Integrated LED lights
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.720]   For like herbs, but these are only these are like two by three
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:39.360]   I want a big one because I want to grow a lot of stuff. I might even have a couple of sheep out there
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.920]   So I can help for lamb chops. Okay. Well, yeah, that's that's how petaluma of you
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:49.600]   Um, there they are
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:55.520]   Yeah, just b g e b r 30, but you know what when I did a search for this I found four for 19 dollars
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:57.040]   So I'm wondering
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.800]   Yeah, I have to go back to my grow light search. These are
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:06.480]   I'm not the same one. That's the same one. Where was the one I found?
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:09.120]   Because a lot of the LEDs out there
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:14.800]   Are either ugly like they won't fit into your normal fixtures or they they cast a really crappy light
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.800]   But this this can be like hidden in your living these these are a 19's you like your br 35s better
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.560]   Well, the br 30 the ges don't come in an a 19. They only come in the br 30
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.320]   Um
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:34.320]   Sure use an air. I just this I trust g e that was that was one of my things also
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:40.240]   And so far I am not disappointed next week. We'll check in on the seedlings and see how they're going. Yeah
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:43.600]   All right
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.760]   Jeff Jarvis Jeff
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:52.880]   Time for a number could do that the wikipedia is 20 years old, which is pretty amazing. Isn't that awesome change the world? Yeah
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.200]   Um, but I'm also sure you don't use our official use them. Pardon me. Yeah
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:02.720]   Make sure you make a donation to them as well. Oh, I do people every month. I give them 10 bucks
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:04.480]   Yeah, yep
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:08.560]   They're the best and and jimmy whales plus you you change the world never took ads
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:14.560]   That's why I give money because I don't want them to take ads. I remember I remember sitting at an event at harvard
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.560]   probably
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.520]   Like two years after we could be started and editor of the New York Times
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:22.320]   You don't understand how expensive it is to have a magnet bureau and he said
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:28.720]   Sorry, but the world doesn't care you can take all this labor from all these people and put all the world's knowledge. Isn't that amazing?
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:36.480]   And we could have done that too, but we didn't yeah, uh, but but but all media just uh, sir official at axios who's wonderful
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.080]   uh reports on book sales in the pandemic way up

[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:04.720]   Wow
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:11.040]   Axios is usually like we're the first to have it. Yeah, never mind. Yeah, well, I'm really sure I stole somebody
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:16.800]   So you steal in mind and use the old story. I'll give you another number Netflix 200 million
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:19.280]   Global subscribers. They had an amazing
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.280]   Quarter they had another eight and a half million subscribers
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:29.600]   And up and up and in fact they've been living on debt, but they say we're okay. We're we're very close to be
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:32.240]   being sustainable
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   free cash flow positive
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:39.440]   What a turnaround of turnaround said all the history is amazing. Yeah, can you remember?
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:44.560]   I was reading something about the other day about little red envelopes at the what oh, yeah, remember those. Yeah
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.800]   I'd always have I'd always have three lying around because I had the three
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.840]   Envelope deal always forget to mail them back
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:58.160]   You want to get three at a time? It was good. It was a good those are good days. Some you still have
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:00.880]   uh
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.640]   I might
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:06.400]   No, no, no, they bill you believe me afterwards, you know, if you don't return
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:09.920]   They go well, that'll be fit. They used to sell them too when they were done
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:13.840]   Or after a certain number of things you could buy them for cheap. Yeah
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:15.760]   Oh
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:19.680]   My goodness, you made it all the way through stacey. I'm so proud of you
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:26.480]   Me too. Oh, we didn't talk about google finally acquiring Fitbit. I don't know when that was the first story I wanted to do
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:30.560]   You know, I oh I skipped by it and then I forgot to go back
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:34.080]   It literally is this it is the very first line of our run back line
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.720]   There's the number one thing I wanted to talk about
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:44.880]   Actually had one other big story this week, but okay. No because we skipped we skipped around and I forgot to go back so
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:51.840]   Is it mean anything? I mean, you know, they rick oaster loan his blog post said no, don't worry
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:55.120]   We're not gonna take the data and pass it along to google
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:58.240]   Around data. This was never about data
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:03.840]   Well, this was never about using your device data for ads. So this deal was never about ads lemme rephrase head
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:11.840]   This deal is all about pulling better contextual clues. So with a wearable that's bluetooth enabled
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:16.400]   You know, I think we're going to be able to use it for presence detection
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:23.360]   We looked at the the forthcoming google next nest hub has bluetooth on it that's capable of
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:31.280]   Managing a bunch of different peripherals, which is unique. So I think we'll see that come very soon
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:37.280]   Now maybe not very soon. I think we'll see that in like a year or so and then we also see you know the
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:44.080]   Any sort of health efforts that they want to make it's it's essential for a digital assistant to have more context about your life
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:48.400]   You see amazon trying to do this. You see google doing this. It makes sense. Yep
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:56.400]   Stacy talks about all this stuff on our podcast with kevin toffle and of course in our newsletter. It's all at stacy on iot.com
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:03.440]   Thank you stacy. She looks just like princess Leia today. If you imagine that you will have
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:07.840]   a perfect she was she was also known as bad cop on our show last week
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:10.400]   She was
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.400]   Did Matthew Ingram call me bad cop?
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:19.440]   No, no, no on your show you and you and mr. Kevin were talking and you went into a discussion and good cop bad cop
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.640]   You were you were bad cop
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:23.280]   Aunt listens to everything
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.880]   And a lot of time he's amazing like I don't have a lot of time trust me. So

[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.960]   that is a sad to say a
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.160]   very
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:07:59.520]   disproportionate
