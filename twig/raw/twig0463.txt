[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.440]   Breaking news just came out half an hour ago
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.880]   Samsung and Apple have buried the hatchet
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   In their what is it nine years now?
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.320]   long-running court case in
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.960]   Which went back and forth Apple sued Samsung on patent infringement Samsung countersued seven years?
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   I guess it's been going on since 2011
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.440]   Initially resulting in a $1 billion ruling for Apple
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.880]   then the Supreme Court heard it and
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.640]   Then sent it back to the lower court
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.400]   approving the decision but saying
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.280]   Now we got to figure out how much money you own the
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.400]   Last we heard five hundred thirty nine million dollar
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.240]   Find a Samsung and on Apple's behalf
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.920]   But the judge Lucy co-set I want you guys to go and talk. I don't want this to go to trial. I
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.480]   Don't I don't want this to go to trial so the companies have
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.200]   Buried the hatchet no comment from it. Do you think the settlement was yes not clear?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.440]   What is clear is that this was something that Steve Jobs kind of launched and he wanted to go global
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.160]   Thermonuclear war on Samsung
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.440]   That you said nuclear I remember those is that crazy
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.960]   And the company waged this war even though it wasn't even with a victory for Apple
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   It's a lot of stuff was revealed about Apple's process. You know there was definite definitely collateral damage on both sides
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.720]   I'm sure Apple
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   Got some money
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.600]   But I think really the what really happened is that both sides had leadership changes and lost their stomach for interest
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.520]   Yeah, well and so they should have it was a waste of time and money. I think I don't know about you
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.680]   But I mean the fact that they spent months and who knows how many millions arguing about whether Apple invented rounded corners like
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.920]   Yeah, you know
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.440]   Yeah, in fact, I think Apple probably
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.140]   Felt vindicated because the jury agreed that Apple's patents were good. They were they upheld the patents
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.680]   There was some debate. I think over
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.840]   You know what did Samsung copy Apple the jury decided that it kind of had kind of not totally but kind of had
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.720]   Samsung no longer really copies iPhones. That's pretty clear. This is about anything
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.940]   They've sort of dropped that about three versions ago what didn't it although the irony is now pretty much
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.140]   Everybody's copying Apple's notch which I think many agrees. It's least desirable feature of the
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.980]   I thought that seems weird
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.380]   Like some phones have notches. They don't even need them. Yeah, I
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:23.940]   That was what I wanted to point out is just how important is the notch because they have sensors in them and if people are going to
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.100]   Wine and claim that they have to have a zero bezel phone
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.800]   You got to put those sensors somewhere or do what Oppo did with the fine decks, which is a very strange design
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.520]   It's a phone that has a motor in it that raises the camera
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.560]   So we don't have to have a notch and then it slides back down
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.860]   Because moving parts are always awesome. Yeah, that sounds like something that should go bad
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.540]   Well, you know, we'll see I mean it's a beautiful phone and because it has no notch
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.040]   It has a 93.8%
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.280]   Screen to body ratio, which is as high as you can get pretty much. It's just the smallest little
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.120]   bezel
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.480]   It's definitely pretty slick looking I give them that you know, but personally I'm not into this whole
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.360]   bezel-less movement or what have you because I
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.240]   Swipe from side to side, you know on my Android device going to different screens and it's so much easier
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   With somebody to have you know meat hooks like mine
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.920]   To have a little bezel to give me some type of you know breathing room
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.280]   Well, the idea is to give you a bigger everybody wants bigger screens
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.560]   But nobody wants to have bigger phones
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.680]   So the idea is to how big can we get the screen without making the phone any bigger and when you that is a
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.720]   6.42 inch phone the Oppo fine decks because it has no bezels. I don't know
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.080]   Do you have you tried the Samsung?
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.920]   S8 and S9 the with the very little bezel on the side that they kind of curve around do you not like this?
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   It I didn't enjoy it
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.800]   It just seems like I fat fingered on the screen a lot
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.840]   When you have these really really thin bezels I even struggle with the pixel - well, I have the excel
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.440]   But I still struggle with just going from screen to screen, you know with the horizontal swipe, you know, I agree
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   I'm I'm the same. I don't like the
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.000]   The lack of in fact, I didn't like the edge Samsung
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.600]   Edges for the same reason I just found that I was triggering things all the time
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.520]   Just like picking it up Matthew. Do you use an Android or are you an iPhone guy?
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.440]   I'm Android and and are you and you're Android as well? Yeah?
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.320]   Yes, sir
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.600]   So I'm the only one here with iPhone 10. I use them all I mean
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.360]   But I get why you use them all it makes
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:55.480]   11 phones or something the instant interesting, you know, but I carry two my deal two or three maybe four
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.000]   No more than I just don't have enough pockets. You know, yeah, it's two hands and five I would say today though
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   The dominant phone is the iPhone
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   You know, we had on Friday interviewed Phil Zimmerman the creator of PGP
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.560]   Who and he started to remember?
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.920]   Silent circle and created the black phone which was a privacy focused phone which failed
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.400]   He said it failed not because the technology was bad
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.120]   But because we didn't understand that in the cell phone market if you don't have a carrier you don't have anything
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.000]   Nobody's gonna buy a phone. We just couldn't sell enough of them to justify the manufacture of them
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He carries now an iPhone and he says from a point of view of security and privacy
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.400]   There just really isn't anything but the iPhone to be considered that's your primary concern. I
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.720]   Think that's fair if you care a lot about that then they are
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:53.580]   Better for that the only the only reasons I've like anecdotally friends and family they want I message
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   Right and they rose gold
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.720]   Their lock ins right there those two right there they're like
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:08.780]   It shows you have trivial really how trivial the advantage is for most we go on about the cameras and the
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:15.960]   Processing from the OLED screens or whatever and really my all my daughter cares about is can I I message people?
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.080]   Samsung today sent out invitations to the Samsung Galaxy s9 launch
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.920]   Which will be appropriately August tonight? So we're only a little more than a month away
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.640]   from the launch of
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.120]   The note 9 in fact the FCC already has the note 9
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.640]   Everything I've seen it looks very much like the note 8 which I thought was a great phone
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.400]   I really like the note 8 the 9 is a pretty slick device great hardware
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.280]   Yeah, and it'll probably have an updated Qualcomm 845 in it
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.360]   and the X and O's of course I
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.800]   Hope it continues to have a headphone jack. It's one of the last flagships to have a headphone jack
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.240]   I'll still miss mine. I know that's a really big thing to give up
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.440]   That I don't mind the notch. I can live with the notch the head for the headphone jack back
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.960]   You know after a while you sort of train yourself to look around that notch if you will it's about I don't see any glasses
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.160]   Yeah after a while you don't see the scratches on your lenses
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.880]   Right and the notch does have function. I mean, it's not a cosmetic thing. You need to put the cameras somewhere, right?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   What's interesting is the new iOS 12 which the public beta just came out this week on Tuesday and
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.760]   yesterday I guess or Monday and
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.600]   on on the iPad they've moved on
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.320]   iOS 12 they used to have the date in this time in the center
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.440]   They've moved it to the edges to make room for I'm guessing a notch will be on the next iPad
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   So the notch is here to stay
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.880]   I
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.240]   can live with that
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:02.600]   But I'm sorry about the headphone jack. I think that unfortunately that's gone forever as well and maybe Samsung will take a you know a clue
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.120]   Continue with a fingerprint reader in the in the headphone jack
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.380]   I'd be okay with losing the headphone jack if you could get better headphones like wireless
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:17.280]   Cluted, you know a lot of them are just garbage. They just drop out. We don't you know
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.840]   There's a lot there's latency in Bluetooth as well
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.480]   Although I have to say Apple's AirPods are less latent than normal Bluetooth headphones
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.320]   So they're doing something to speed those but there's still a
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:35.080]   I can't wear a lot of in-ear headphones. They just hang it out of your ear like that. Yeah, or they fall out or they hurt to right
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   Yeah, I
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.960]   struggle with just the protocol the Bluetooth protocol because
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:48.160]   If I want to try out some Bluetooth devices like just regular headphones to walk around the block or work out in
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:54.240]   There's always this interference. They sound great the few that I've reviewed and tested they sound great
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.840]   But the second I put them in my put my phone in my pocket or something
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   I start getting all of this static and interference and I'm like man
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.800]   This is just this is just ruining it, you know
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.720]   So give me a wired headset and I can continue to have high fidelity audio
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   You know without all of the
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.920]   Trap as a point. I don't see why if the phone is literally in your pocket
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.080]   It can't make a decent connection from your pocket
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:26.360]   I mean this got nothing to do with the the speaker quality. That's just a protocol. Yeah, yeah
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.120]   Well, maybe yeah, all right, maybe yeah
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.360]   I agree if you get rid of wires and still be as reliable as wired that probably is the future
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.560]   My favorite was was the Google headphones where they tried the pixel buds
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.640]   Yeah, and you had to in order to pair them you had to like put them back in the case and reset them just
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:52.240]   Such a bad design the rumor is that there will be with a new pixel 2 or 3
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.200]   I guess it'll be there'll be a new pixel buds design as well. I hope so because that's like oh, I got rid of mine
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.920]   I couldn't use them. Yeah, you want to use our headphones. How about we kick you in the face?
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.880]   Yeah a couple of them and the thing that they
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.880]   Touted the trans simultaneous translation didn't work at all was terrible didn't even work. Yeah
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.960]   So those you know they sounded all right, but then they had a wire. I don't know
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.400]   As long as we're talking cameras
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.080]   I'll quickly run through some other rumors
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.920]   This is Android police saying the next version of the LG which is the V30 very nice phone thin cubernized from the V40
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.960]   well, I have five five cameras and
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.480]   two two on the front and face unlock and
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.520]   And three on the back I have a three lens
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.080]   phone I just bought the Huawei P20 Pro and
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   It does very nice imagery, but I think I think it's a kind of gimmicky one on the P21 is monochrome one is color
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.560]   Okay, and they work together to give you a better image
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:01.160]   DXO they shouldn't they give you better HDR right yes exactly and better low light right
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   And in fact the XL mark gave him the highest camera phone rating well
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.960]   I think a hundred three something like that they've ever given
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:15.720]   Remember the onion about the razor with like three blades and four blades 80 blades
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   There is a phone we were talking about yesterday a Mac break weekly with like what is it 14 different sensors on it different all the
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.520]   That's the stupidest looking thing - it looks like something wrong with it nice looks like it's a genetic
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.080]   mule
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.200]   Missal report with that Huawei phone
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.560]   How are you feeling about it from a performance standpoint because it has that care and chip in here
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.280]   I just own chip
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.960]   I mean as far as I could tell it's just smoothing you know, it's there it is
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.400]   What is the name of that phone that is that weird?
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.960]   It looks it looks awful it looks
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.920]   It looks like an abomination
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.880]   Software where the AI puts eyes on everything
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:11.400]   Literally a creepy looking phone because they don't put everything in any logical array or it's just
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:19.320]   Like a glitch let's put some more cameras on there. So the P20 is nice. I would not recommend it
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.800]   Okay, this is the Huawei Chinese phone. I was thinking about the P20
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.120]   The cameras okay, but you know you the pixel 2 is great camera the iPhone's got a great care
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.160]   Good great cameras kind of table stakes in the Android or iOS
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.720]   Sphere right now almost all the flagship phones have very very good cameras P20
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.200]   I could maybe marginally better, but there are some I'm I think some serious privacy concerns
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.920]   I'll reset. Yeah, well, but to add that to that
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.160]   The first thing I wish I'd gotten a screenshot. I'll do I'll reset it and do it again
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.520]   The the very second question they ask you is before you get into Android setup
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.760]   Huawei says would you like to have accurate weather forecasts? Oh, yeah
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:19.480]   Well for that you need to give us permission to access your location. Okay, that makes sense your IMEI number and your
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.040]   For weather
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.400]   I mean, I guess kudos to them for telling me they're spying on me
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:35.640]   They're not hiding it. No, they know us Americans are just gonna hit next next sure
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.840]   And now well now I don't want to do I want to put anything do I put my last pass on there?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:46.200]   Do I want to put my my checking account on there? I mean I'm it sounds like this phone. They've got it completely
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.080]   bugged
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.240]   You have a really expensive burner phone sir. Yeah, well and the screen is an LCD
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.120]   It's a 1080p LCD. It's not very good. It's not a great panel
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.480]   So it's not particularly cheap if you buy it in the US it might be cheaper in China
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.680]   It probably is but you buy in the US. It's not particularly cheaper
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.000]   I I would say get a if you want a really nice feature
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.120]   I mean very nice feature rich Android device with a great camera
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.840]   The S9 is a good choice to note 9 will probably be a good choice
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:20.680]   I would stay away from the P20 do not get it. Yeah, that would that would make me nervous. It's that's scary
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.920]   That they want my I am EI they want per so basically in the very very early setup
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:34.560]   They under a completely bogus pretext. They're they're saying well. Can we hit can we track you? Yeah?
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:42.400]   Down to the device down to the device that is hilarious and having given that permission not to Android but to
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.920]   Huawei
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.520]   Now you can be assured that everything you do is tied to your device ID
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.320]   Yeah, this has nothing to do with Google. This is all Huawei
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:18:02.120]   Well, yeah take a target government services to you, right? Yeah, well
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:07.080]   It's for your for your benefit. So that's the question actually. This is a larger philosophical question
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:14.240]   So what if China knows everything about me what it what could what could go wrong unless I go to China?
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.160]   Maybe but but assuming that I'm not gonna go to China
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:26.040]   What do I care if the Chinese government has a dossier on me? Is that something I mean, you know, there's a obviously a it's it's
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.360]   insulting and you know, they shouldn't but what can they do to me really?
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:38.440]   Yeah, I mean, that's fair. They could you're just as likely to be a target of hackers with or without the Chinese government
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:47.120]   I'm not advocating for it, you know, but I'm saying it definitely depends on the person if there's somebody
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:54.440]   That's working on the hill. Yeah, they they got no member of no, but of course nobody cares in in Washington
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.200]   We know there's many many stingrays in Washington many run by apparently foreign governments
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.940]   Yeah, that the president refuses to use a secured phone
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.920]   We know that Pence's phone was hacked very early on
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.360]   So yeah, if you're a government
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.160]   And and that by the way is the I can't remember his Department of Commerce
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.960]   It's the recommendation of the US government that you not buy phones from CTE Huawei or Xiaomi
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.800]   And now I see why
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.040]   You know, it's funny though people pay a lot of attention to the phone
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.800]   but
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.720]   like
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.960]   Dozens of people I know lots of people I know have routers and and other devices in their house that are Chinese made
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.280]   They've got everything's Chinese made
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.360]   Everything in your house, you know, it's got you can track all kinds of
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:49.200]   Activity and but no one thinks about that. It's just a box. So this is a this is a pixel - that's made in China
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.320]   This is an iPhone 10. That's made in China on the other hand. It didn't ask for permission
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.760]   right
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.200]   from
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.800]   That's what but ultimately that's why I think Phil Zimmer and
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:05.560]   Says trust Apple because even though they're assembled in China Apple's paying attention to what's going on
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   Presumably in five Foxconn and they're not allowing stuff to be put on the phone and so forth
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.760]   Although I got to say Apple, you know, I think they get a lot of positive marks for their commitment to
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:22.120]   privacy and so on but did they not agree to give the Chinese government effectively a backdoor to
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:28.400]   To their devices and to their users in China. I don't know. Did they not do that? Oh, they do do that. Yes in China
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.900]   Yes, not to America. Yeah, right? So we get privacy, which is great and thank you to Apple
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.040]   But HD editor in our chatroom said actually something that's really a very good point
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   I think people don't consider the friend of a friend problem sure
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.120]   I may not care that the Chinese government can spy on me through my Huawei phone
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:53.600]   But I'm also giving up information about friends and family and that is a really good point
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.340]   That is good. So I will go home. They do allow you to
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:03.200]   unlock it they have a website where you can unlock it and root it and
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.940]   Maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll just say this is my burner phone for rooting purposes
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:14.860]   But that's a really good point and something we don't we often don't consider I've talked about this before we did when you say yeah
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:21.660]   You can have my contacts. You're not only giving your information. You're giving everybody in your addresses book information to this company
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.540]   That's the kind of the flu analogy where I where I use that with people I say well
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.660]   I don't want to get a flu shot, but doctors will say well you might not want a flu shot
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:38.340]   But everybody you come into contact with is gonna get the flu from you. So it's kind of you know
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:44.360]   It's not for you. It's for the people coming to contact with you. Matthew Ingram is here from the Columbia
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.820]   Journalism review. He's chief digital writer there. Hey, Matthew. It's great to have you one tea one tea everybody
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.620]   Matthew I on the on the Twitter and prove it to only need yeah
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.540]   Yeah, you you're sufficient one is sufficient
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:06.760]   And Pruitt is also here from tech republic and guess what Jeff Jarvis is arriving as we speak we're gonna shuttle his
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:13.160]   Discussing his fly in his TV set in just a second while we take a break to talk about
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.380]   Mugh soft. I love the name Mugh soft and the logo is a little cow
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.080]   So that's the Mugh and the founder loved synthesizer
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.600]   So that's the Mugh and it's software that I T people know and love because
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:35.460]   it takes all of those noisy alerts that light up your monitor all those tickets like a Christmas tree and
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.800]   Shrinks them down by up to 99%
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.180]   Guaranteed Mugh soft AI ops. It's out. It's not AI as an artificial intelligence
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.920]   It's AI as an algorithmic it and it's an ops platform that can reduce your IT and alerts and tickets by 99%
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.620]   Now, I know you could do that by just unplugging, but this doesn't unplug no
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.660]   It in fact it plugs into more everything all of your existing IT tools, but then
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.800]   Mugh softs patent technology correlates all of those events
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:10.020]   Into actionable work items they call them situations and you can then instead of seeing a hundred alerts
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.560]   Look at one situation say ah, this is what all those alerts are telling me. Let's fix this
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.780]   so you're more effective you're more efficient and
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.320]   This is a relief. Let me tell you eliminate unhelpful noise
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.820]   Focus on making the changes and the fixes that you need to make
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.900]   I'll give you a great testimonial you'll see it on the website from HCL technologies
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:38.660]   They're a global IT managed service provider and they use Mugh soft AI ops as the event management layer within their award-winning dry ice platform
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:47.380]   They say it's helped their clients streamline their operational workflows and reduce the time and the detects to correct life cycle of incident tickets
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.360]   In fact a significant reduction 33% reduction in meantime to restore
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:58.220]   That means they can support more customers with quality service and keep operational costs low and
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.700]   Maximize efficiency let the machines do the boring work
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:12.780]   You do the stuff that really matters with Mugh soft AI ops you can you reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 99% right now
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.820]   You want this it's the next generation platform for IT incident management. You want this
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.540]   Go to Mugh soft calm to get a demo m double OG s o f t
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.920]   Dot com Mugh soft calm. We think of so much for making their IT
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.940]   Operational what is it algorithmic IT ops?
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.380]   platform available
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.780]   To all of you Mugh soft calm
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.660]   Jeff Jarvis you got back in time. I saw not really I was late
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:52.020]   Sneak above my lower third finally got your whole title in here the Jeff Jarvis is a Leonard Ta professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.780]   Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University New York also director of the townite center for
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:02.460]   entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University New York
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:12.420]   That's that's actually yeah more like a lower half or it's a second chin now
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.980]   Well, we'll get you a normal one there you go. There we go. There we go. Sorry. I'm late. Sorry
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:24.460]   So I was an aspen doing the aspect ideas festival
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.420]   Well, actually I can I can right now that I'm gone
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:35.620]   I can actually rant on aspen but we'll get to that in a second, but I was doing the intelligence squared debate and
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:42.580]   The proposition this time was that social media is good for democracy guess which side I was on
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.260]   Guess how bad we lost oh really oh, yeah, so it was Emily Parker
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:55.260]   Who's wonderful just wonderful. She among other things had started a did a startup with while go name with ex of Google
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:01.100]   To have civil discussion online and the other side was Roger McMean Franklin for
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.300]   Did they change your mind or did you just use the debate?
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:11.340]   We lost in a day because what they do is they have a vote beforehand then whoever has the greater delta afterwards
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.500]   We lost one percentage point they gained all of the undecideds
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:21.540]   So Friday we're gonna kind of keep part two of that debate because we're gonna be joined by Siva Vaija Nathan who has a new book
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:27.100]   Saying a bit part of the debate. He sees it as a form or to wolfo on these topics
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.860]   Well, you've agreed and he's agreed and we're gonna have him on
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:37.180]   With Jeff Jarvis on Friday as part of our triangulation show to talk about it
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.820]   His new book the premise of his new book is anti-social media how Facebook
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.020]   Disconnects us and undermines democracy
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.900]   Which was exactly
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.100]   Yeah, well we know why obviously
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:56.540]   So this will be and it will be a civil it won't be a debate it'll be a civil conversation
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:02.340]   See was great. We disagree about tons of things, but but I love discussing with you. He's wonderful
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.420]   He said if I can butter him up enough, he'll be nice to me
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:11.660]   He's a smart guy a professor of media studies right at UVA. Yes. Yes, so
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:17.580]   Yeah, yeah, I just got his book. Yeah, I've been reading it. It's really interesting. I haven't got I haven't is it out?
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.700]   I
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.420]   Might as it arrived. I got a copy from the publisher. Oh, okay. It may not be out yet
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:29.500]   Let me just check if it's out. I'll send you a copy so that you can I got it up to our inaction
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.380]   Let me see on
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.540]   Facebook
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.580]   You know, I was thinking the other day, you know, we're doing right now
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.220]   Which doesn't make for great airtime. I know but why don't what is it every TV?
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.580]   You know MSNBC CNN have still have the laptop
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.300]   But it actually look up facts while they're on the air because they make they do have laptops
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.020]   But I never see him any check you know
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.660]   it's actually TV
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:58.380]   Because it because you know why in fact I I didn't watch the MSNBC in a while because my stress level is so high and I watched it
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.060]   And it seems like they're all rushing through all the segments
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:08.460]   Yeah, it's a great time for Chris Matthews is particularly bad. Ari Melbert pretty bad. They they feel like they're
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.060]   That they and and so you really never feel like you have enough time to finish a conversation or a thought
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.180]   Oh, yeah, I've been on a couple of those shows. I know yeah
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:23.500]   I'll get the Kindle right now. Yes, so it's I thought it was out next month. Yes out June 12th. It came out good
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:29.340]   I'm MSNBC since Windows XP when they made it your default home page
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.540]   You know they're on TV now and
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.340]   Uncle and here
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:42.280]   Jeez I think I've got big machine behind you might be able to get television if you put the other
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:50.040]   I think it's why aunt is so serene. That's true. Then it's he doesn't let himself get stressed out
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.360]   New yeah playing lands. I turn on the phone. I mean
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.060]   I'm gonna take a lesson from you aunt. Let me stress you out
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.660]   Let me go ahead Jeff and then I turn the phone and I see you know, Justice Kennedy retiring. Yeah
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.380]   I got nothing to do so these two guys I said I should have said nothing a word to the whole time
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.860]   I'm gonna show them a poison. What would happen over the air?
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.700]   I'm stressed
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.980]   It's very stressful for people who were worried about the tilde the Supreme Court's gonna suddenly take
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:26.260]   But I want to talk with you aunt because as a person of color you probably have some interest in this issue of face recognition
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.540]   and
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.060]   There was a really good editorial
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:38.140]   By an african-american CEO who works in this
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.980]   Field he wrote it for a tech crunch Brian brachine
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:49.220]   Saying he's chief executive officer of Kairos which develops this stuff
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:57.380]   He says law enforcement absolutely should not be using existing face recognition technology because of
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.460]   racial biases
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.900]   He said as a black chief executive of a software company developing facial recognition services
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.260]   I have a personal connection to the technology both culturally and socially and he's
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.340]   Seriously concerned that a lot of innocent people will go to jail
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:23.860]   Lot of innocent people of color will go to jail because there's no place in America for face recognition that supports false arrests and murder
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:33.060]   Agree 100% it's not there yet. It's just not there. It must concern you because you could be a victim
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:40.780]   Mm-hmm, you know and I can just take this take this back several notches just as something fairly simple
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.700]   You know right now you're looking at me on the screen and I have a beard okay
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.060]   and
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:54.820]   If I was to shave my beard and just go with the whole van dyke look go T. Look what have you I'm categorized a certain way
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.900]   Because I'm a black man with beer and yeah, you look like
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.180]   Unstinguishable, you know, and it bugs me because
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.660]   I've done I've done that a few times just experiment and see what happens
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.780]   with my social media and engage with certain people online or whatever and just
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:21.580]   The communication that I get from people based off of this look versus when I've shaving it off
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:26.500]   It's fascinating, you know people think I'm less intelligent for whatever reason. Oh my god. Really?
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:34.100]   I've been told you're just a beat head because I'm bald hit it and I have a well and another another point of
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.860]   Prejudice you have a southern accent southern accent, you know, and and I'm thinking
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:46.620]   This is the type of data that's being fed into all of these AI systems and it's just not right
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:53.940]   You got to fix this stuff. So, you know, that's one good area about the whole gorilla stuff. Oh god that that you know that
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.520]   And that that's an important point to we keep on considering the algorithm itself
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.620]   But it's the incoming data that needs an audit to yeah
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:07.380]   Well, that's some medium. I'm trying to remember who wrote it, but it they basically the argument was
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.320]   The facial recognition should not be used period by a government
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:20.140]   Forces or law enforcement that it's basically the technology in the implications of the technology are so
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.180]   Enormous that it shouldn't be used period at all
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.420]   So though it depends on the use if you're going to use it to find a missing child
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.240]   We're going to use it to find you know a missing Alzheimer's patient
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.140]   But it's you know start carving out well well, but no no you
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.300]   The technology is not bad. It's use is bad you regulate not the technology
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:44.020]   But the use and I agree it should not be used law enforcement. It's not ready. It may never be ready
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:49.540]   I'm not arguing with her, but that doesn't mean that technology should then be cut off for other purposes that could save lives
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.780]   Microsoft and I have a problem with that
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.100]   Yeah
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.100]   Yeah, cuz that means we know that
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.820]   See there's still though risks. We know that concert venues for instance use Amazon's recognition
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.420]   To identify bad actors people have had problems within the past and refused admission
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.220]   I presume casinos have been doing that for as long as they could right. Yeah
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:18.380]   Hard converse the Scottish but if this fate, but if recognition thinks all black people look the same
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.620]   That's not that's not a good use of it. Yeah, it's a look. It's a lower
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.900]   Harm but still not a good use of it
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.300]   I mean the promise of facial recognition is we can recognize
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:37.420]   You individually and yet the technology just cannot do that. Yeah, here actually
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.220]   Bald guy with go T on my left here
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:50.420]   Microsoft does say that it's been using
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:58.860]   Additional training to improve results. They say their error rates are down 20 times
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.700]   Isn't this business only a data problem?
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.500]   Arguably
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:12.260]   Right, which is which is to say what the all which is a bigger issue here is what the society have photos of
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.620]   I
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:21.340]   Think if there is a larger problem and actually my daughter's doing her college thesis on this which is that
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:28.260]   Unintentional biases introduced into all of these automated systems because the people who are creating the systems
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.420]   past their biases and ignorance and
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.980]   abilities on and
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:41.160]   The problem is so unconscious is what Kathy O'Neill writes about with weapons of math destruction
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.380]   And zane up to Becky too
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:49.100]   I mean the algorithms that drive social platforms that drive Google that drive you know
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.700]   They're designed by human beings and human beings have biases
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:58.620]   Unconscious biases largely and those getting coded in the algorithm and so are newspapers and so are
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.540]   Movie studios and so we're TV studios and it's true across all of that not justify any of it
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.000]   I'm just saying that's exactly the problem is that is is that the process of
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.860]   Civilization of improvement over time is that we that these biases we you could I mean you could trace his the history of America
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:22.420]   In to some degree is as we we learn about these biases we try to correct for them
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.660]   And a lot of it is really just mass mind and cultural consciousness
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.460]   And it's a process of getting woke and then getting woke again and then getting woke again
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:38.940]   Yeah, it's a process just like you said and we're making progress. I hope we are sometimes two steps forward one step back
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.100]   Used over back and it feels to me like oftentimes
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.660]   algorithms in particular YouTube's recommendation algorithm Facebook's news feed algorithm are actually entrenching
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.500]   people's biases
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.980]   Instead of trying to help correct
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:00.900]   Yeah, that that is something that has changed and I think it's probably what C was talking about is what we'll talk about on Friday on
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.540]   triangulation is that big data and fast computation
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:13.060]   Have kind of weaponized these biases in in new ways and they happen faster and more powerfully than they have in the past
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.900]   And so maybe that's the two steps backward is
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:24.180]   That these biases are getting writ large and when police are as a perfect example when when when law enforcement starts using
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.260]   biased face recognition software to arrest people
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:33.900]   That is an example of how the bias can real. I mean, there's always been bias, right? I mean
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:41.900]   Witnesses eyewitnesses are notoriously biased and bad at being faces, but it's a slower process
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:48.300]   Right, and you're not talking about bias in an algorithm that controls what two billion people are seeing
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.460]   I mean, we've never seen anything on that scale
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.980]   well, um
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.460]   I'd say you write and I take the point back here
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:04.260]   But I but I think we have to acknowledge that all of American society and scale as bias. Yeah, it's just and it's not just
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:11.420]   Algorithm that makes billions of decisions a second. Yeah, that's kind of my point is that that it's yeah
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.180]   We all have far we all have biases that get acted out every one every day
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.740]   But when a computer is doing it at mass scale that can have a much right with law enforcement
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:26.420]   Mass scale to when every police officer in the country. Yeah, he's making decisions every few minutes. I'm not knocking all police officers
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.740]   I'm gonna be saying
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.020]   that
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.060]   Is there bias their decisions? Well? Yeah, we have the data and and we know that and that's at scale
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.940]   That's the issue. I think there's one thing that that we're trying to fight
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:46.300]   I think now is that people aren't accustomed to thinking of algorithms as having biases and they're not encouraged to think that way by
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.540]   platforms that rely on those algorithms
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:55.940]   the the sort of you know the story is well the algorithm is a magic box that computers run that that
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:02.020]   Performs certain functions and I think part of what people like Xana up and others are trying to do is to say look
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:07.260]   These are products of human beings human beings have biases. They should be treated in the same way
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.420]   Just like we thought doctors were God
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.300]   We think the algorithm is God, right?
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.060]   But we've learned I mean the you know news algorithms have not produced better news
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:28.020]   And a lot of these companies wave at the algorithm, you know as the kind of the man don't look at the man behind the curve
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.500]   Right. Oh, it's just the algorithm. Yeah, and you were saying
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   It just makes me think back to
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:41.140]   Maybe two years ago at most when all of the techno panic come out about the AI and algorithm
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.700]   causing people to lose jobs and
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:51.180]   To an extent I could see that because we can build robots to do dysfunction and that function and not have to hire
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.260]   manpower to do it
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.700]   But on the flip side of that I always said well
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:03.100]   Why not hire people to help feed the algorithm to help make the algorithm better than what it is right now, you know
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:08.100]   Exactly, and I saw some stories. I was just coming in and it was talking about
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   More algorithms being more human. He was hired
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:17.780]   Google said in their in their YouTube blog that
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:25.980]   Using AI and machine learning doesn't mean fewer human beings. It actually means more human beings. Yeah on the other hand I
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.660]   Do want the the burger making robot
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:35.620]   And and I know it's gonna eliminate some jobs, but I want to see the burger making robot operate
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.180]   You see that story this week. Why would you just keep it out there? Don't bring that to my house
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.180]   I cook my own burgers. I
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.540]   Here is the creator
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:52.780]   This is a startup restaurant called creator and this is the burger making robots
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.180]   This is kind of great of knit. Oh, look at those
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.300]   This is John Constantine at TechCrunch
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.580]   Well, it's not what I thought John Constantine looked like that's
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.300]   Josh I mean, yeah, that's he's quite the hipster, isn't he?
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.020]   So let me see the robot in action. This is the interview, but let's see the robot
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.100]   Well having worked at a McDonald's I
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:24.620]   Was basically a meat robot when I was the the grill at McDonald's and I could do this by the way a lot faster and a lot more efficiently
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.420]   Yeah, oh
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.420]   You all you old guys say that
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   Man, I could okay
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.620]   Come come behind the grill with me sometime here
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:38.140]   Sunny come behind the grill with me. I'll show you whippersnappers
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.420]   We used to get used to get a tray of 12
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:47.260]   Regulars, right so that's 12 patties. They they give you a spatula. That's a foot long
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.700]   So that you could flip six at a time. Yeah, that's right foot foot foot
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   You got the the the the ketchup squeezer and the mustard squeezer
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:03.560]   Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo. I could crank out 12 patties in three minutes like that and they were delicious and they were delicious
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.740]   They were good eating
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:11.140]   Notice you said patties you didn't necessarily say burgers. I wasn't that's why I'm meeting the patties
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:18.800]   Look at this this is disgusting this thing is a mess. I don't want to eat this. This is gross
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.920]   You're the wrong did everything you did everything you know that does that look like there's ketchup on the sloppy
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.860]   First if I did that a McDonald's I would have been fired
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:35.300]   All right, and and Matthew a junk food experience working experience earlier in your lives
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:45.140]   I won't wear you particular, but I did my I did my fast food run for a little while and which chain I know it was pretty much
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.140]   You're pretty robotic yourself working on those little lines
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:56.180]   But it was because you don't have any thought process on on what the ingredients are you just see what your order is
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.460]   Yeah, you know that it is two ounces of this four ounces of that
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:05.700]   Rapid-sended period. I just don't know I just read Anthony Bourdain's kitchen confidential
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.140]   Oh and pretty much every kitchen is that the whole point of a
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.260]   Comer of a commercial kitchen of a restaurant kitchen is to produce
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.380]   identical food every single time
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:21.540]   Yeah, and keep costs down because it's already costing a ton of money just to run that restaurant
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:28.740]   So that's how you you know maximize those margins by knowing that it's only four ounces of cheese that goes like this
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:33.460]   Oh, man. They got mad at us if we gave them two ketchup packets every ketchup packet is four cents
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.100]   You give them one pack manager. I was the kitchen manager at potter versus steakhouse
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.220]   And I don't know if you can be able to see this or not don't take no offense
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.860]   What I'm about to do can you see the difference between those two fingers?
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.300]   One shorter than the other. Yep lettuce slicer. Oh god. Oh
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:54.660]   Yeah, yeah, Mike the manager who trained me was very short and had short stubby fingers
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.020]   So he when he showed me oh, just don't move the plunger. Just put the lettuce in
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.500]   And so I made true chef salad
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:10.020]   So somebody got your finger in their salad well to to aunt's point he did debate for a while whether to throw out the lettuce
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.580]   That stuff costs money
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.340]   Somebody picked that lettuce
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:21.300]   So I thought that working at McDonald's and I did that it was my first job when I was 15 and a half
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.700]   And I did that for every summer for three or four years through half of college
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.260]   And then I worked in the college dining hall where some of the best that was a great job. You move fast
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.900]   You you never the worst thing in job is to be standing around right aunt
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:40.500]   You the harder you work in the better the faster the day goes the more I had a great time
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.900]   And I learned how to work
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:48.500]   Don't ever stand there if you don't have something to do you're cleaning right right you lean in you need to be cleaning
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:54.820]   Or as as my or or as the leader of the machine. This is not the dishwasher. You are
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.660]   Where did you work matt? Did you work at fast food?
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.860]   No, I never did any fast food. I pumped gas
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.380]   um, okay worked at a little gas station then
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:10.580]   Had to counter, but I didn't that is not a good job pumping gas. I would far rather
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:15.860]   I really enjoyed it really really enjoy. Yeah, I don't know why I like the smelling gas, which is weird, but
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:23.220]   And uh, so I would go home smelling like hamburger grease you'd go home smelling like petrol
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.940]   Yeah, I loved it. I love the smell of gas
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:30.340]   Smells like victory. I can still sing the theme song
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.420]   Go ahead
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.580]   If you like your steak give your appetite a break get your steak get the ponderosa steak house
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:44.260]   Grab a bucket and mop from the floor to the top. Tell me what does it mean at mcdonald's. We're clean
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:52.820]   It's my era. I worked in mcdonald's with golden arch with the old-fashioned two golden arches and everything was
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:58.340]   It was originally a billion burgers ago. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it still said millions on our uh sign
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:08.980]   I loved working at mcdonald's the only and one summer if finally they said, you know, either you have
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.540]   We don't get that you want to have a career here
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.860]   You think
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.020]   No, did you try to argue them out of it?
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.780]   Um
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:25.220]   I I think they said look if you're willing to go to hamburger university instead of Yale university. We'll think about it
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.100]   And I said, you know
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.100]   Mm
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.180]   What if what if all those jobs went away with that?
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.260]   Would society be worse off?
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.860]   I think it was good for us to have those entry-level jobs for each one of us
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:44.260]   We're critical in the early days, right? But you could do robot repair now
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.780]   That's not as much fun
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:55.700]   I kind of I don't know. What do you think aunt? Your kids held your son is getting to that age, right?
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.140]   10th grader and is in a seventh grader now
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:03.700]   So they're getting to that age where they might get their first job. Are there jobs out there for them?
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.340]   No, actually
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:12.260]   Here jobs that are available for them would be like a grocery store attendant service
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.940]   Service jobs
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.460]   Stuff like that the the fast food those are going away
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:23.140]   Market of it is is usually for the older kids is usually for the the high school seniors and people like that
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.380]   Yeah, work your way up to that. Mm-hmm
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.260]   Yeah, I still see it's full time. It's full time work for a lot of people, right?
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.660]   The Amazon has its way. Nobody'll be doing working in grocery stores. You need it
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.740]   Part of me is fine with that
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.940]   Because I like the not great delivery system, you know, I like the whole idea of
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.420]   I need about
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.340]   Six pounds of ground beef by tomorrow. Can can you work that out?
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:55.860]   And I really don't feel like driving across town, you know, or better yet. I need a nice
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:02.020]   Six pound pork belly because I'm gonna be barbecuing in a country. You're a real chef
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.540]   You were actually we're a cook. Hey, I'm a southerner
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:09.940]   We we don't mess around when it comes to cooking
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.340]   There ain't no pork belly in a McRib sandwich. I could tell you that right now
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.940]   There ought to be but there isn't
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.780]   Uh, I like I like the idea of a delivery system from
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.140]   Amazon and they have that whole prop was it called prime now?
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.860]   Yeah, I think that's what it's called and I've I've seen it pop up on my feet or whatever
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.420]   But a lot of the things that are offered to date is not of use to me
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:40.740]   But I'm sure they're gonna expand that and start, you know, bringing more things that I'm interested in because yeah, just hey deliver it
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.380]   I'm all for it
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.660]   Somebody woke up like google somehow
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.900]   Earlier today there was I think an outage on the google home there was which was
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.620]   Google home and chrome cast they weren't talking
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.500]   Uh, I kept asking my google home because I want there's a thing you can do with the google home
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.060]   You could say look who can get it belgium's belgium just scored a goal and it'll go
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:08.100]   You can say it's a whole other thing
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.180]   So I just asked asked for this I said, well, we'll get
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.820]   Are you up again?
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.860]   I'm always on the clock
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.260]   The good news is I love my job
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:27.940]   Well, I love my job. Yeah, say tell her uh tell her somebody just scored some country just scored a goal

[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.180]   Well, we'll get germany just scored a goal
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.340]   Sorry, I don't know how to help with that. Oh, shut up. Oh man. Oh, it's still down
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   I
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:52.180]   Didn't go down because I assume they have special canadian google home servers. So
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.860]   I wonder if i'm wondering if that's the right uh syntax
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.140]   I did get the day it was so much fun
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:04.660]   Germany just scored a goal
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:10.740]   It was my syntax it was my bad
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   pronunciation I think that's fun
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.140]   I was a machine is training you. Yeah, exactly. You have to be trained by the machine
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:22.020]   Uh, let's see. Where do you want to go? You want to do facebook? You want to do amazon?
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:28.180]   You have jeff you uh, you have a story you uh said hold for jarvis the gline didn't say that karsten cars
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:35.380]   The google news initiative journalism fellows who are these good looking minor? Nope, but I think it's really great that uh
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:42.180]   They're all women that they are all women. Wow. Wow at last. So that's good. That's cool
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.180]   So what is the news fellows program?
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:49.380]   I don't know what this one is the google news initiative is the new thing that kind of expands on what they did in europe
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:53.060]   The digital news initiative now is the google news initiative where they start their guessing
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.460]   This is what it is. You have to be the news lab fellow camps
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.180]   They've been going on for quite some
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:05.060]   Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's good. That is uh, that is really
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.220]   fantastic to see
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.380]   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 women
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:15.540]   Yeah, although somebody wrote about uh google and facebook funding journalism and how it's problematic
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:23.780]   Didn't it is it? Yeah. Yeah, who who could have done that who might have been the contrarian trying to argue that? I don't know
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.100]   I remember it was a good piece matthew. It was good piece
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.980]   Who wrote it matthew?
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:38.740]   I'm sorry. I'm not in on all the that was matthew subtle way to plug. Yes. So
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:44.900]   Mr. Ingram you care to elaborate on yeah, thank you. It was uh, so I was looking at for the
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.700]   columbia journalism review. I was looking at weather
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:54.420]   google and google in particular has spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.700]   fellowships and research and training and
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:01.220]   um, and so the I was just looking at whether that's
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:08.100]   uh, whether there's an inherent kind of conflict there for journalists or for journalist againities to be
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:14.180]   taking money from large platforms that they are increasingly relying on
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.900]   for their journalism or for their
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.420]   business
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.020]   and of course
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.060]   I have a good full disclosure full disclosure matthew talked to me
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.380]   So i've i've accepted money from facebook and craig new mark obviously and
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.420]   the fort foundation others, but I am independent of facebook and none of their money goes into my pocket
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:37.300]   Well and matthew you wrote about the fact that both twitter and facebook
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:40.980]   uh, effect recently, I think jack dorsey just had
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.380]   uh
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:49.860]   meetings with shawn hannity and a bunch of uh conservative commentators to reassure them that they weren't
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.500]   liberal slanted
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.540]   right
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.260]   And facebook has been doing the same thing trying to convince
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:02.420]   Conservatives or sometimes and the platform isn't biased against them. Yeah ever since the trending
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.500]   rule off
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.540]   But I think that's so the what I the point I tried to make in there is that
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.700]   You know, it's fine to to try and do that, but it
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.300]   If you bend over backwards to to reassure
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:19.380]   Conservatives that's going to have an impact on what you do on your platform
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:24.020]   You could argue that you could draw a line between what happened with trending topics
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.340]   and then them firing everyone and feeling sort of under the gun about
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.900]   bias and then
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.580]   You know effectively
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.420]   Conservatives and the right wing weaponizing facebook to help elect on trump
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.260]   And we talked on the show about about the current kerfuffle
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:47.060]   There being always a kerfuffle about facebook and labeling political ads with the who?
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:54.580]   Um places that we talked about that in the show. No, we know they're doing it now. Well. Yeah, why is there
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.700]   a couple here's here's here's why is it a couple of kerfuffle because
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.620]   Um
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.740]   I'm not if you correct me if I'm wrong here and you're understanding what they've said is
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:08.420]   Anything with political content has to be labeled. Well, the new york times does ads promoting their political coverage
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:12.420]   And so oh we have to ask for acquiring them
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:17.220]   Do the same disclosure and when they don't they say that facebook has rejected their ad
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:21.540]   Now on the one hand I think the simplest thing to do here is to say if you're a news organization
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.940]   You're a different thing. But on the other hand, we're gonna get into a fight right off the bat
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.500]   Who's at his organization? Is it bright part? Is it in full words?
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.660]   And so what facebook has tried to argue now in which one more sentence then
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.940]   Well, place book is tried to argue became well-rounded on stage with the new york times
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.340]   New York times went after facebook and her hard
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.980]   at an event at columbia and
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:46.340]   And camo brown from facebook came back and said what's wrong with transparency on the behalf of newspapers
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.260]   My view is that every ad should have full transparency as to who bought it
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.780]   Um, and and that would be the wise way to go
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.820]   But the way facebook rolled this out once again got them in war hot water
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:03.940]   Matthew well, and and so what what the new york times and other new organizations have said is that they want to be exempt
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.580]   from this policy so that they
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.060]   They're from they're from i don't think so i'm
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:15.620]   To be if you promote a story that's an ad that's called an ad and so if it goes into an archive of ads
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.860]   I don't see how that's
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:24.420]   A problem like the the argument. I think that emily bell and others have made is that this that's a very slippery slope if you start
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.260]   um
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.380]   categorizing
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.980]   what amount to
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:33.380]   News stories promoted or otherwise as political advertising that encourages
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:40.500]   Users and readers to see them as somehow biased when they're not so what does she argue in the end Matthew
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.860]   No, she's what
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   So i'm not sure she has an answer. I mean, I think she she said she understands facebook's perspective on it
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.340]   That they are trying to be more transparent
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:55:00.420]   This you know, they're trying to get get on top of the whole advertising problem that that they wound up in front of congress for and so this is a step that they
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:07.220]   Believe will help do that they've created two separate archives one is for news and one is for non news
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.780]   so that's kind of their
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.500]   concession to news organizations. I mean to be
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:18.580]   This is a problem that's inherent in facebook's platform a promoted news story just looks like a news story
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.180]   so it's not an ad in the same way we kind of think of
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:25.620]   Ads it just looks like a news story. It's needed
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:32.020]   Truly. Yeah, right and that's an inherent so facebook on facebook everything can be an ad
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.740]   And so everything is an ad in a way
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:41.060]   So it's kind of it's a it's a definition problem and and we can't facebook can't solve that
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:47.460]   Yeah, are we just going to accept that people are going to use facebook for news, right? That's just given
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:51.940]   Kind of use whatever they want to use for internet is
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.180]   Allegedly, right?
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:56:00.900]   Internet it's the internet. It's the internet. Yeah, so it does have to be solved. I mean you you have to somehow solve this issue
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:06.180]   Another angle so that the other sort of aspect that the reason why media companies
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.380]   I think are so upset or part of the reason is because facebook has
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.940]   Decreased their organic reach
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:18.420]   Gradually over time to the point where they have to promote their news stories in order for people to see them
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.140]   Because they can't rely on organic reach anymore
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:26.900]   So on the one hand facebook is saying you have to promote to pay to promote your stories or no one's going to see them
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.060]   Or that's how it's structured things
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:34.740]   But then as soon as they promote those stories so people will see them they get labeled political advertising and
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:39.060]   Wow
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.100]   This is hard stuff that's tough
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:47.540]   It's very hard and that's and I think that just the analogy that it's hard is the important part of this
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.020]   Um, you know, it's I'm going to be working on another project soon on the kuny
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.020]   I'll talk about it some future week
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:58.820]   But try to define what news is then what quality news is those are those are really hard things
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:02.020]   Not just hard. I would argue that's impossible
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.980]   I mean quality news and it goes back to
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.340]   All the surveys and people try to focus on trust
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.380]   Facebook wants to define what's a trusted news source?
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.820]   Well you and I might have completely different views
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:23.060]   Problem with it is it's a little patronizing to humans like oh, we've got to let you know what you could trust or not instead of saying
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:27.060]   Yeah, that's why I think trust is the wrong is the wrong scale, but I think I think that you can
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.140]   You think it's like the trust project named trust
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.340]   but in which papers like the washington post and
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.300]   global mail say that they will
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:43.300]   Agree to I don't know six or eight standards. They will label opinion versus news
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:48.340]   They will put up the names and biographies of their writers and the masthead of the entire publication
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.740]   That's an indicator of quality
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.620]   And I think there's there's lots and lots of indicators like that
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:58.660]   And I think that's fun what you do with that indicator should be up to each individual in each platform and and so on
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.580]   I don't believe in having a whitelist or blacklist
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:05.140]   but I think doing a better job of of of gathering and
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.780]   Progating those those indicators those signals
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   Um helps make better decisions because the algorithms are making decisions
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:15.940]   Yeah, and I'm not I'm not saying the trust indicators aren't a good idea
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:21.460]   I'm not saying, you know fact-checking and those kinds of signals aren't a good idea. I think they are a good idea
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:28.020]   I just think they're a tiny tiny drop in a very large ocean. Do you do you guys all use do you use
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.820]   You said you don't watch news channels anymore, but do you get where do you get news? Do you use
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.380]   Facebook for news
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.380]   Twitter is my news twitter
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.020]   And many of the same is right
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:43.940]   And most of you follow links on twitter when you when you get news on twitter do you
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.820]   Then drill into whatever the link is
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:52.260]   Yeah, it depends on the source because most of the time like I can't sit here and say I follow CNN
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.820]   okay, and
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:00.100]   The people that I follow they will retweet a CNN or some other news source and
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.980]   I basically say well if so and so retweeted it I probably should take a look at it
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.900]   That that kind of thing, you know
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.780]   Because if I just followed CNN and clicked on every single thing
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.500]   I would end up getting pissed off because some of it is bad in my opinion and it just
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:20.580]   Doesn't necessarily add any value to my to my day, you know, but if one of my peers
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:26.420]   Retweets it that's how I go about news of the day. So you have curated news from it or friends
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.780]   Go ahead. Correct. I used twitter in exactly the same way
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   I mean to me, it's a social news reader
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:40.260]   So people that I respect or organizations I respect tweet things and and I use that as kind of the way I used to in RSS
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:46.260]   You know and and
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:50.820]   Nothing against CNN their job is to report to quote-unquote news, but
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:56.820]   A lot of stuff that I've seen from the likes of CNN and other news outlets is
[00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.380]   Something is it just over sensationalized and I'm like, this is not
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.500]   Not worthy and then the the headlines
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.220]   Really pissed me off
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.340]   You know
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.940]   I write for tech republic so I understand that the idea
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:17.700]   Behind having a good headline to get people to want to click on your story
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:23.220]   But there are a lot of times when stories pop out there. Uh, I think the last thing that comes in my mind was
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.580]   Flight was diverted from
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.780]   Was diverted to Charlotte
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.260]   That was supposed to go to London
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.500]   You know and I'm thinking it just didn't make any sense. Where did the flight come from?
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.900]   You know if did it come from jf k did it come from from maryland?
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.620]   You know, but it made sense when I read the story because the flight was coming out of spain
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:51.380]   Uh, well, no, I came over it just it was all confusing the headline just didn't make any sense
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.460]   I can't remember the story, but
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:57.540]   But and usually headlines are used to manipulate. That's the other thing is it right?
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.860]   You know, that's my argument of this this debate
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:04.500]   We had was that was I kept on going after the fact that media are who polarize society
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:11.700]   Media pitted red versus blue black versus white 99 versus 1 percent media invented the business model of clickbait
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.340]   And sensationalism and all that we accused the platforms up now just following
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.020]   The trajectory that we set in media. Well, yeah
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.100]   But I mean even if a newspaper
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.500]   invented clickbait
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.540]   A newspaper was only going to reach, you know, maybe two three hundred thousand people if that
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.220]   um
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.260]   You've got
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:38.260]   Facebook and google and and even to put her for that matter instagram snapchat have kind of weaponized
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:43.540]   Clickbait and turned it into something. Well, no, I think you weaponized it
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.220]   But it's it's an orders of magnitude bigger problem
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:52.580]   No, aunt was just talking about CNN. You're talking about television was the invention of the notion of mass
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:57.220]   Look, I'm using my local my local news station
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:02.020]   If I were to turn on the television and they do their teaser before they go to the commercial break
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:07.460]   You know, it's it's really really played up and yeah, it's a little heaven. We've been used to
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.460]   They've been doing this. Oh, yeah, right?
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:12.180]   You know, you're fault
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.180]   And you wait around and you're like that's all that was about yeah
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.460]   Oh, wait, that's
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:24.100]   Then at the end they play a video that they found on twitter. Yeah, that's the that's what really cracks me
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:28.580]   All right. Well, we sound like a bunch of old guys sitting around on a porch saying, you know
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.380]   a problem with this world is
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:37.380]   Do you think technology can get us out of this? I guess is the is the final question. No
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.540]   No
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.020]   People can use technology to get us out of this
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.460]   Technology can help all right
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:52.500]   Technology didn't cause it all so we can acknowledge you can't solve it all no the first fake news was in the first herald tribune
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.060]   in the 1800s
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:00.820]   When they were trying to gin this was a great story in um fantasy land kurt uh
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.500]   And is it anerson kurt innocent great book about uh fake new the history of
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:15.460]   imaginary stuff in america in order there was a circulation war and in order to gin up circulation they pretended that
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.780]   telescopes had seen
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:23.300]   The lunar that was the new york sun new york sun that was it the new york the lunar population that is series on
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.700]   The people living on the moon
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:34.100]   Yeah, and they had wings and yeah, they had they had scientists talking about how they lived in these caves and so on and other newspapers picked out the story
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.100]   So it's been as long as there have been newspapers
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:44.340]   So indeed, I just I just finished rereading this magnificent book by lizabeth isosine
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:49.460]   Who's the key scholar of get your drinks ready gutenberg divine our infernal machine
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.460]   For the machine about from gutenberg all under the present and and she has a chapter on newspapers
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.860]   Uh, just give you one or two quick quotes
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:03.620]   Doctors expressed concern about the state of the nation's mental health and Simon alarm is about the effects of sensational journalism on the national psyche
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.140]   When was that fair that was in the 1800s
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.700]   um
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.700]   the
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.900]   German is a critic
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.460]   Quote a newspaper is a business undertaking which produces advertising space as a commodity
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:26.340]   Which becomes salable only by means of non advertising space right then the model has been there forever right?
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.220]   Um, uh, where was it here up?
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.860]   Until your buddy craig new mark disrupted the whole damn
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   Mm
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.180]   My favorite was benjamin franklin actually created a fake news story
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.500]   Really then published it himself. Yeah
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:45.700]   Published it himself in it pretending that it appeared in an issue of an actual newspaper
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.180]   And it was designed to basically
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:53.620]   Get people angry about I think the british empire. Um, and he just made the whole thing up
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:58.020]   So it does strike me that it is neither different in quality or quantity
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:04.100]   What fate what's happening on facebook or cnn or anywhere else but I think there's this this moral panic
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.820]   It's a ball terra said
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:12.500]   It reaches a different quantity and I think it's a different in speed and magnitude speed maybe yeah
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.220]   So votel votel terra said
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:21.780]   Uh journalism was discredited by the multitudes of papers which greedy booksellers are published and which obscure writers filled with incorrect
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.100]   extracts stupidities and lies
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:30.660]   But you're a dev newspapers were invented for the solace of those who were either too busy or too lazy to read whole books
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:36.420]   Rousseau said a periodicals and ephemeral work without merit and without utility
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:41.220]   Ah, so what exactly was that about books things were same thing with
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:47.220]   I couldn't trust what she says anybody could just write a book. Yeah. I found that headline
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.660]   Oh, the headline the headline reads
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:56.100]   American Airlines airbus bound for charlotte diverted to london airport
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.340]   That does sound odd doesn't it?
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.500]   You know, but then the very first line is
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:07.460]   An american airlines jet headed from bar cilona spain to charlotte was diverted. That makes a little more sense
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.180]   Oh, yeah
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.980]   But that's just sloppy. That's just sloppies. That's that's neither link
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.860]   Or it is sloppy. Yeah like a lot of a lot of this is driven by the economic model
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:27.220]   The only way to make money or the only way lots of media entities have figured out to make money is advertising and the way to get
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:33.940]   Advertising money is to drive clicks and traffic although in order to do that you have to sensationalize your news
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.180]   I do want to point out that the charlotte observer seems to have a real knack for link bait
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.500]   Here's some other local headlines
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.740]   Where is the mercedes that a witness says seem to accelerate as it hits cyclist?
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:51.620]   Question mark good question hunt for cereal flasher at virginia shopping center leads to mma fighter, please say

[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:07.620]   Wwe star charlotte flair featured naked any spans body issue man. I want to read every one of those stories
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:12.340]   Hey, you just say rick flayer and charlotte everybody's gonna stop rick flair
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   There you go
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:20.500]   Is there any tabular outbrain down there? No, you know they don't need tabular outbrain at the charlotte observer
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.260]   They're creating their own
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:26.900]   Wow
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.980]   That's a that's a that's a that okay, so but your points well taken jeff
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.500]   By the way, let's give her a full plug elizabeth l iron stein
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:41.460]   Divine art infernal or isens isens no iron's isen stein. Yes. Yes. The vine art infernal machine
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:47.460]   The reception of printing in the west from first impressions to the sense of an ending
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.260]   Oh, I want to read this university of pennsylvania press
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:55.940]   Uh very interesting point to your point. I think whether it's clickbait or fake news
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:04.420]   Or I mean these are human problems. These are whole that's kind of my point. They're human problems. Yeah algorithm tweaks are not gonna solve
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:08.740]   His problem. Yeah, the problem is not technology, but human behavior on technology
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:13.300]   So that's not to say that technology shouldn't be designed differently to deal with that
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.260]   I think that it's true. I just wrote a book chapter about this and argued the same in aspen
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.500]   it's true that
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.820]   People like me and the technologists were believed too much in openness. It didn't recognize the result
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.980]   We didn't recognize efficiently the manipulation that would occur not just economic, but also
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.380]   A psychological and political
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:36.660]   Um, we haven't been they haven't been open enough. I mean all that's all that's true, but but you're you're all right
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:42.580]   This is not this it's not the cause. It's not the solution. It's a fact. I was on a I was on a panel and trying to remember
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.540]   Who was all we doing panels right back to yes?
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:51.380]   I'm trying to remember who was who they had a great analogy and I can't I can't remember who said it
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.020]   but if if I think of it all mention it and
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:58.100]   They said that social media is an accelerant
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:04.820]   Uh, it doesn't create problems like political or social or cultural problems. It's an accelerant
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:10.660]   For those problems. It's like pouring gas on a fire. So it isn't the underlying problem
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.700]   But it but it can exacerbate a problem
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.900]   So
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:22.900]   Does this let twitter and facebook off the hook? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.420]   But it doesn't it doesn't we have to be where the moral panic
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:32.420]   That blames everything on them and then creates legislation and regulation around that and there's worse because neither
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.300]   Mm. Did they create it nor can they cure it?
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:41.860]   And I think they are a factor they have a role they can accelerate there. They can help they should but we have to work with them
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:46.340]   Right and part of the problem was the sort of technological solutionism
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:52.340]   You know that the kind of utopia idea that a great algorithm can solve society's problems
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:57.860]   So I think this all becomes uh relevant because we're headed into a midterm election
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.540]   and uh
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.100]   There's concern
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:13.220]   That whatever happened in 2016 could happen again. Mm-hmm. I it seems a little late to be worried about it now
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.540]   But maybe
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.500]   But it's ever ever thus. Yeah hindsight
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:24.340]   And I think that's why facebook and twitter been meeting
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:29.460]   There was another story about them meeting with government and intelligence sources to say hey
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:33.700]   Can you guys give us the heads up about anything that we should be well
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:38.820]   They were very frustrated because when they met with it, they got nothing they got the guys said well
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:43.620]   Let's give it tell us everything you know, but we're not gonna tell right you anything. We know
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:48.420]   Right. This was a meeting that took place May 23rd at facebook headquarters
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:56.740]   Amazon apple google microsoft oat snap and twitter were there the times spoke to three attendees of the meeting
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:06.580]   Uh, also there christopher craves under secretary for the department of homeland security representative from the fbi's newly formed foreign influence task force
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.220]   Neither the department of hormone security nor the fbi had anything to say about it
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:18.420]   And apparently didn't have much to say at the meeting either they got shut down. Yeah, they got nothing people attended described a tense atmosphere
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:26.260]   Which the tech companies repeatedly pressed federal officials for information only to be told repeatedly that no specific intelligence would be shared
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:33.060]   I can't understand that they for whatever reason. Well, they want to protect their sources. I I disagree to this extent
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:40.820]   Um, i've talked to people from both facebook and google very high level very frustrated with government because there are
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:46.260]   Cases where government knows there are crimes and campaigns and other things going on and they don't share anything
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:51.300]   Right and in the case of russian manipulation if they're not sharing information to try to stop it
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.780]   Gee that smells a little suspect. Well and in fact
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:02.340]   Others at the intelligence agencies have testified in congress and other places that the russians are already well added
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:09.700]   And I don't think they need to provide sources. They could have just said look these are some general patterns that we're seeing or
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.860]   There's other, you know
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:16.340]   internet research agencies or things like them and we've seen them meddling in this or that I mean it
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:23.060]   Well, but they told the senate that they said russia's using fake accounts on social media many of them bots to spread this information
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:31.700]   European elections being targeted to as brexit was the uh, we expect russia to continue using propaganda social media false flag personas
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:36.820]   sympathetic spokespeople and other i mean, it's the same playbook they used last time so
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:40.820]   It's not like these companies don't know what happened last time
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.900]   I wonder if I mean, okay, I hear what they're saying, but is this a little bit of saying?
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:52.420]   Well, they didn't tell us anything. There's nothing we can do about it. No, no, no, no, I've heard them personally
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:57.940]   They're very very frustrated. Well, what do they want? I mean, they know what's going on. They know about bots
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:00.660]   No, well, yeah
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.220]   And people kills a million a million bad accounts a day
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:09.700]   What they want is some measure of intelligence to be able to know better the way it goes back to the alfrancan moment at the
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.220]   Hearings sometime ago when franken said ripples you should have seen because it was rubles
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:21.620]   Well, they didn't know to look for rubles. They didn't know this was going on now that they know they need clues and signals and governments not cooperating
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:26.420]   And gee once again, it has to do with this administration and russia starting a political for a moment here
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.860]   But I think it's all the more reason why they should be revealing
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.700]   Um in some way or another so the government's not helping them at all
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:38.900]   Zero well platform is trying to do the platforms are on hot water. The government's not helping them at all
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:43.540]   That's the it's a classic meeting though. I mean the fbi or wherever you meet with them
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:48.580]   They're not going to like hand over information the number one thing they're going to do is try and get information out of you
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.980]   So they're going to try to get you to help them
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:56.820]   More than they're going to help you yeah, and I'm not sure that that's unreasonable
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:03.860]   Uh twitter has done some things. I mean today they announced new new plans to make it harder to
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.380]   Create spoof email accounts to create accounts on twitter
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.580]   Um, they are I think twitter is doing as much as it can to make sure that account creation
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.380]   Um is harder for bots, right?
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:20.020]   And they said their AI is getting better in terms of spotting
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.460]   Suspicious account creation. So hopefully that's going to
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.580]   Help
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:31.860]   The thing that troubles me. I mean facebook. I don't know if you guys remember facebook came out with its own
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.500]   internal security report
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:40.980]   um looking at bad actors and bad behavior on the platform before the russian thing blew up and there were
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:46.420]   There were some significant reports from insiders that
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.780]   The report was basically
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:55.140]   Cleaned up so that russia wasn't mentioned as a big factor
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.740]   Yes, so this is a two-way street
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:00.580]   That troubles me
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:06.660]   It seems easy to blame the fb. I didn't tell us anything when they're doing this they're doing what they're accusing the fb. I have doing
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:10.500]   I don't know
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.660]   attempted to just to give up on the whole damn thing
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:16.260]   you know
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.860]   Well
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:22.420]   There are things the platforms could do that are positive like get out the vote campaigns, right?
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.580]   Well, even that's controversial because you know, it does not have bias in it. That's for who?
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:30.500]   Well, don't say for who just say everybody needs to vote get out there
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:36.100]   But voter suppression was the largest issue that we really have in this election voter suppression is the entire issue
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:41.860]   So trying to get the vote out is a political act. I agree with you. They should it should be mom and apple pie
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.340]   But even that isn't in this crazy world
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:47.140]   facebook did an interesting experiment where they
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:52.980]   allowed you to say, you know, I voted yeah, you can sort of put a flag. I thought that was cool
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.140]   Yeah, would they do that the primary here
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:01.620]   And they tracked it and they found that it increased voter participation by measurable amount. Yes
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:08.980]   It put and now's the time to say are you registered to vote? I don't see how that that's controversial
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.300]   I
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:17.540]   Like that because people you dig into the peoples. Uh, was it FOMO fear missing out? Oh, wait a minute
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:23.380]   They got a little check mark on their app. Yeah, I want that. I want the button. Yeah, they should make it really cool looking
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.940]   like an animated gift or something
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.340]   so yesterday of twitter
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:32.740]   Published how twitter is fighting spam malicious automation?
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.820]   Um
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:39.540]   They're showing the number of accounts challenged. This is this graph has got up significantly
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.700]   Um
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:47.620]   And then it went down and then went down, but it's back up again to a peak now in may it was 10 million accounts challenged
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.660]   We're moving twitter says
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.940]   214 percent more accounts for violating spam policies year over year
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:59.060]   the average number of spam reports we use three through our
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:02.820]   received through our reporting flow continued to drop
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.620]   I I guess that's a good thing
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:11.940]   You know, it was interesting to me in that in that facebook report was it wasn't bots or spam
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.940]   Or fully automated accounts that were the biggest
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.660]   Problem or the were the most interesting
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.980]   It was semi automated or bot like accounts
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.580]   So people where there was a real human being
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:32.740]   Theoretically behind the account, but they were basically mimicking sort of bot like activity
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:38.900]   Right, and that's a really really hard thing to detect because they look human. They are human. Right. Exactly. That's the next step
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:44.660]   And the the thing the big takeaway that I took from
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.180]   Facebook's report was that
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:54.900]   And and intelligence sources say the same thing the majority of the activity was not designed to try and convince people
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:18:01.460]   To move from one side to another. It was just designed to create chaos and uncertainty
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.580]   That's the goal
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.020]   Yeah
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.500]   But then then did you all watch the paul bacartney
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:17.220]   Carry open cars video. I didn't I wasn't I wasn't going to watch it because
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:24.340]   I can't sit here and say I'm a big Beatles fan or anything like that, but I respect the the art
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:26.260]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:31.780]   And boy, I'm glad I watched that video. Yeah, you know, and I'm breaking it up for two reasons. It's a cheap
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:39.060]   Segway, I admit but it also, you know, in leos in my grandpa's grandpa's age
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.300]   You know the 60s and the Beatles
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:47.780]   And it was amazing to see because that what that well that era meant in terms of fighting on the barricades and people at risk
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.540]   and government buildings we didn't want and all of that and yet there was a voice of
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:58.660]   A English and hope from the Beatles and I just brought it back out again. It was just I was I was in tears
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:06.100]   Made you happy to see Paul James yeah, so that's so that's why I didn't watch it, but then eventually I did
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:10.580]   I haven't seen it yet. We haven't seen it yet. Oh, you know, watch the entire
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.940]   The entire so
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:20.340]   Are you allowed to have music on the area? Yeah, but I don't I can't hear it. Are you are you do you have me potted up? I'm I'm up
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:23.540]   Oh, sometimes we have problems with the
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:27.940]   Audio anyway, effing technology effing technology
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.580]   We usually try to check this before we do the show
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:38.260]   The audience if you haven't watched the whole thing take my word for it take answer word for it watch the entire thing
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.060]   I I do think James cordon in a Beatles wig
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.300]   You're a sergeant pepper outfit. That's pretty funny
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.140]   I just find him incredibly annoying. So that's why I
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.180]   I sort of like him. You don't like him. Oh, I like him. I
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:55.700]   It's great. It's really great. Okay
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.820]   All right, it's good. It's so much for that effort for a musical interlude
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:10.260]   Oh, why have these troubles audio's hard california kind of
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.220]   I'm sad to say
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.580]   Blanked on that neutrality
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:20.580]   Angle their wild and who's
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.740]   You would think with silicon valley
[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:27.780]   Is it is it is it back to soap of people is it is a hollywood versus silicon valley? What are they?
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.540]   um
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:33.620]   Sides in this that you think that california would be easy to pass
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.580]   No, you know it came from
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.180]   Miguel
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.180]   Santiago who apparently
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.740]   Did not want the zero rating
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.740]   uh
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:50.340]   Provisions and of course zero rating is a big issue, but it's a tough issue because it's hard to convince
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.380]   I think voters that something that saves the money is bad fight them
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.980]   Same with Amazon right? Uh
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:02.420]   Uh and actually people I think he's in orange county
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:09.700]   Assemblymen people have started to take out uh somewhere in southern california people started somebody bought uh bill board in uh orange county
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:14.660]   Saying remember he's the guy who torpedoed net neutrality california
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:18.740]   Uh washington state though does have a good net neutrality uh bill
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:27.860]   Uh law so at least there's one state that has it. I you know, it's funny. I don't know if this is related, but I was looking at this variety
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:30.660]   uh lineup of att
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:34.260]   Their new wireless plans will make it free to watch
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.020]   What a surprise a bunch of att properties
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:40.340]   Yeah
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:41.620]   convenience
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.500]   So this is what we're talking about when we're talking about zero rating is that
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.860]   AT&T which is acquired time Warner is now going to make a bunch of time Warner stuff
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.500]   free on AT&T wireless
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.220]   Which is why Comcast wants um
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.620]   And w only
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:01.540]   Well, and why would that be a bad thing consumers say well, that's great. It's free. Well because then you
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.340]   Are right? This is picking winners
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.860]   This is exactly what everyone was talking about when net neutrality first became a debate
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:15.140]   This is the future where the carrier or the cable company that you choose determines
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:17.540]   What content you get because it's free
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:21.540]   Yeah
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:26.980]   Well, the other way to put the problem is it's fine if you have at and t but if you have Verizon or t mobile
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:30.980]   Um, maybe you can't get it. Maybe it'll be really expensive there
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.620]   uh, and and so it's a it's a
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.020]   Fencing
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:40.100]   Of content. Maybe that appeals to consumers. I don't know it's a really hard message to cross
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:44.820]   Yeah, I mean if you're an AT&T customer, you go great now. I can watch hbo for free
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:50.980]   No, not hpo or not hbo cnn a mc cartoon network tbs tnt
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.620]   All the time Warner stuff
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:58.820]   Um, exclusivity has been around forever though, you know, just remember you remember the iPhone
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:04.340]   You couldn't get it unless you were using AT&T's really really bad service back in the days. Yeah
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:06.260]   Oh, yeah
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.540]   Yeah, that's true
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:08.500]   but that
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:14.820]   Content like news and I'm just I think zero rating is a slippery slope you could argue
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:19.540]   That the reason the iPhone is so dominant in the United States
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.220]   I mean it helped AT&T and I helped the iPhone didn't it?
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.820]   It did
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.500]   um
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:32.340]   And I I think you can very much argue that if a phone doesn't get carrier support like Phil Zimmerman's black phone
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.660]   It's dead in the water
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:41.060]   And when shao me had a phone that they thought they had AT&T and verizon all signed up for yeah, and then the federal government
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:45.940]   Lay, you know put pressure on carriers. Oh, don't carry those chinese phones
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:52.180]   So 18 horizon dropped them and it and it practically put shao me at a business
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.620]   It certainly did bring a business in the us. So yeah, these are
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.220]   I
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.540]   Don't think it's good for consumers competition is good for consumers, but it's hard to explain
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:08.580]   Why saving you money is a bad thing it really is and uh, but I think if you if you explain to people how
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:15.380]   You know, you like that last right and so sure great net reflects might be zero rated for you
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:19.780]   But what if something comes along that's better than ever? Yeah, it's an opportunity cost
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.980]   Nobody understands opportunity costs and
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:28.260]   Talking about something put you know imaginary the next netflix. Yeah, what is that? I don't know
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:34.260]   I like netflix. I'm happy to get it for free. Why do I need a new netflix human being you talking about the amazon brand buster story
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:40.580]   That's a fascinating story. Isn't it's really actually related because amazon can come in and because it has
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:45.780]   mechanism to promote the market to recommend to make and distribute
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.460]   um
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.820]   It can beat
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.460]   All kinds of brands and consumers will say
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:58.420]   And then it's a little sneaky then it's a little sneaky because if you search for underpants
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.940]   Uh, and you might get amazon basics
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:05.380]   I kind of want that smile on my underpants. Yeah, I like that
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:07.380]   And you might get good briefs
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:11.700]   And what you might not know is they're all it's both amazon all amazon
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:14.260]   They have 100 private label brands
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:19.620]   And why would you do that? Well, so that you can do these recommendations and not be seen to be
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.340]   favoring yourself
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:28.500]   Spotted seabroids kids clothes. Yeah, but on the other hand, you know, macy's has house brands. Oh, it's good for consumers
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.740]   Um
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:34.180]   Amazon was good for consumers in book prices until
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:38.980]   They had a monopoly and then it was bad for consumers. Yeah, sure
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:44.340]   The problem the hard part is you've got companies like amazon that are
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:49.220]   It's hard to define whether they're monopoly they're monopoly in some things
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.540]   They're a monopoly and
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:57.860]   You know certain vague vaguely defined things facebook is monopoly and I don't know social connections
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:05.220]   Is that even a market and yet so we don't we literally don't even have the terminology to talk about the things that these companies are monopolies
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:07.220]   No, it's a new way of
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.820]   Monopoly and
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:13.620]   It's very difficult. I you know, I went down to our local bookstore after Anthony Bourdain's death about a week later
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:18.660]   I wanted to get kitchen confidential from my son because I wanted him to read that before he took a job in the restaurant industry
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:23.060]   Which he wanted to do and uh, and I went and they said oh no, yeah, we're sold out
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:27.780]   Because that when he died everybody bought up at the board a books now if I had been that bookstore
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:31.060]   This was a week later. I would have rushed I would have gone
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:36.340]   To borders and bought all the other I would have gotten every source possible and loaded it up
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.580]   But they said no, we don't have it we can get it for you
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:44.660]   And I said no thanks because I can go to amazon and have it delivered to my son tomorrow
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:47.220]   right, yeah
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:52.180]   We actually had a conversation with a friend about this retailer in Canada
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:57.060]   Chapters, which is a bookstore. He went into buy a book
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:03.460]   Uh actually wanted to go to the store. I don't know why and the book is there nice bookstores are fun
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.260]   Yeah, so he looked around and found a book
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:13.140]   He's like I want to buy this book and it was 22.95 or something and on the chapters website. It was like 1699
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:18.820]   So so are you gonna give me the price on the website? No, no, no, that's the web price
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:22.100]   But if you come to the store you have to pay this other price, right?
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.300]   Are you insane? Why would I do that?
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.620]   Well, that's why there are no more stores
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:33.300]   Right, there's and it's a set but that's a sad thing. There's another example of something that's not good
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:37.060]   For society. No, not have bookstores. But getting both sheep is good, right?
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.700]   So i'm getting but sheep is good
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.220]   Right. I like that
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:46.260]   You can't wait. So sure that then the warehouse, you know, is empty and the store goes under and but
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:52.900]   I got a cheap book now if you want to really want to make money create a free game and put it on iOS
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:57.700]   Fortnite is generating more revenue than any free game in history
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:00.340]   300 million
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.380]   in
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.380]   In a month in one month in may
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.900]   Yeah
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:06.340]   Compare that
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:10.660]   To poke remember how pokemon go was eating the world in 2016
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.540]   200 million in in its biggest month august 2016
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:21.700]   So when I was in aspen I had to get my haircut because I was gonna be on tv after all and I go to a nice lady there
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:26.340]   I go to one place and they're gonna try to be 60 bucks. I said no, you know the next place is 45 bucks
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:31.780]   Still aspen pricing. That's another story. So we're talking about all the incredible wealth and aspen
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:34.900]   Major of what's his know who's the big
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.380]   Alan
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.580]   Cleveland
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.580]   Basketball the
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:43.620]   I think the brand
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.180]   But another
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:51.940]   Bauda old house and aspen had to raise the entire house up to dig down to create a basketball court, right?
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:56.180]   This is the kind of wealth you have there. So she said, yeah, one of my clients, you know, he created
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:02.420]   The candy game and he never thought yeah, I make a game. I would be a billionaire. That was an aspen
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:07.780]   Well, I could just assure you if anybody buys to it for hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:14.660]   I'm not moving to aspen no poor. You know, I I tweeted this or I think they're even the dog who's got facelifts
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:24.980]   Yeah, it's funny because fortnight not only is it a free game they they make all the money through
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:29.700]   Digital goods, but they're not digital goods that help you play better. They just help you look better
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:35.860]   Scaling the skins and dancing and yeah, it's not about better guns. It's just about looking better
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:42.500]   Is it not on on Android? Yes, it is. Yeah. Oh, it's not yet. It's coming. Oh, it's coming. Yeah
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:50.500]   But it's on everywhere and what's interesting is that it's playing it's doing so well on mobile because it's really a
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:55.940]   You know a desktop or constant. Yeah, I'm surprised. Yeah, I mean that it's a complicated game. It's on the tenth switch
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:30:02.340]   That's right not not Android. Yeah. Yeah, overwatch did the same thing the skins my both of my daughters were so getting a skin
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:09.460]   Fortnite kind of eight everybody alive. I mean even overwatch which I love I think overwatch is a great game
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.820]   But what's the what's the life cycle though? We get how long how long before it?
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:17.940]   Yeah, they think they're gonna take over the world. I think he's gonna win and stuff that pokemon goes a good example
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:23.860]   I've never seen more obsession about pokemon go we were down in san diego when it was at you know at its peak
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.780]   and uh
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:30.180]   There was us, you know how they have median strips of nice lawn and some trees
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.500]   And it was like woodstock you could there was jammed because there was I guess some
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.380]   valuable property there
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.980]   And people were just camped there. You couldn't it was like
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:45.460]   And you see this all over the place at golden gate park at central park
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.380]   You'd see it all over the place and then it's gone. It's over
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:53.460]   I actually started playing it again because they've added all the features they promised to add two years ago like trading
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:00.420]   Friends and apparently the active player count is higher than it's been since the launch. Oh, interesting. Yeah, so it's coming maybe it'll come back
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.420]   There's still lots of people playing it just doesn't go
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:08.260]   Yeah, and seriously, you're the one who has actual gaming like real equipment stuff. Do you play fortnite?
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:11.220]   That would be no I have better things
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.300]   What's your game? What's and what's your game?
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:21.940]   My game is still good old fashioned team fortress too. Oh, well, that's the same game
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.580]   It's just a copy of tf2
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:29.940]   Oh, no my kids sat I sat my kids down one day to try to play tf2
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.100]   and
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:34.660]   Actually, you know, I told him to come watch me play
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:38.820]   And this his eyes were just all over the place. Let me show you how daddy does
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:45.540]   You know because fortnite bores me. It's so slow. It's like it is just slow. Yeah, sniping
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:49.460]   It's slow until everybody gets pushed together. He'll let everything right, right?
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.860]   And that was everything really
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:55.700]   I don't think you could say that I fairly could say that I play fortnite
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:32:01.780]   I enter the world parachute in gliding and die immediately and then watch for the rest of the game
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:04.180]   So playing
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:06.180]   Right. He's a fortnight tour
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.180]   Yeah, I'm a fortnight tourist
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.820]   Die materialize die

[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:32.820]   I love it. I love the verges now young people still love twitter
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:36.660]   as screenshots on instagram
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:39.540]   apparently this is the new way to tweet
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:44.020]   Is to is to post it on instagram take a picture of the tweet
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.660]   and post it on instagram
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:52.500]   pew research center reported the fewer teenagers than ever are using platforms like facebook twitter or tumblr
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:57.860]   It's not though that they're finished with content from the sites instel inst instead instagram has grown
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:05.300]   A home into a home away from home to consume screenshots of the best content from those surface surface services
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.540]   It's all memes though, right? It's all memes
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.380]   Yeah
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:13.140]   manic because i'll pick look at manic
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.860]   pixel mean queen is an example
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.500]   Although I have more followers than she does so I don't know
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:25.380]   I actually this is a trend. I loathe on instagram instagram
[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:33.300]   I like to see pictures of your canoe and lake. I like to see photographs. I don't want to see memes
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.380]   Yeah
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:39.860]   That's because you don't want to read all of these parables and stuff to share instagram
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:42.820]   Come to instagram to read want to see pictures
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:47.140]   Here's a guy with 1.9 million dollars see reigns
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.620]   That's because we're all
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.500]   I
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.500]   Domino's pizza posted
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.860]   I like this domino's pizza australia posted so what did your parents tell you when you were younger so you'd eat all your food
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:03.060]   Somebody responded eat your food or i'll make you domino's
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:07.540]   See
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.340]   See
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.860]   Don't you this is meme
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.260]   I'm a limer good some of them are good. Yeah
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:17.940]   It's a good way to keep up with I guess what he does is reposts others
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.740]   So if you want to keep up with
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:25.380]   You know what I got to say this is in so my daughter youngest daughters
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:29.540]   20, but for the last like three four or five years
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:34.820]   I've noticed her almost the entirety of her media consumption
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:37.620]   is
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.140]   remixes so
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:45.940]   And that covers everything not just music but so it's reposts of reposts or memes that are created out of other memes
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:48.340]   It's like meta every
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:53.940]   Is met and so it's not she's not consuming the thing
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:35:02.020]   It's someone's take on the thing or the meme of the take on the thing. It's fascinating like it's it's next level
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:05.300]   That is fascinating. I see a lot of these
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:08.740]   like the lady that that
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:12.340]   Wanted to call the police on the black man at the barbecue
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:17.700]   People will redo that 50 times. Yeah, I got so sick of seeing it
[01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:21.860]   You know, yeah one or two times it's clever, but she's under bright
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:24.660]   be original. Yep
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:27.700]   Ah
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.020]   Let's see what else you guys want to talk about
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.620]   Sierra
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:36.260]   Young people's young people still love twitter
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:43.940]   Um, so so the gadget makers bracing for trumps trade war
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:50.100]   Right, well, this is kind of an interesting back and forth. Yeah, what's going to happen to an iphone in china
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:55.540]   So tibok who's you know, there was a great picture on the new york times of a two-faced
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:36:03.620]   him cook facing a president she of china and president trump of the us and playing both against the other of course china is
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:07.940]   vital to iphone manufacture most iphones are made there
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.540]   uh trump has promised that administration has promised not
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:16.340]   to uh tariff phones or tv's
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:19.300]   um on the other hand
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:23.220]   Uh, if we have you know, we've got 250 billion dollars of tariffs on china
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:27.060]   There's nothing that could stop that would stop china from retaliating and otherwise for instance
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:31.300]   Terrifying incoming parts for iphones
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:37.140]   Right. That's that's the issue right say we're on cars. This is the problem with
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.940]   I guess trade wars. I've never lived through one, but uh, there's a lot of
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.140]   Well you are an alge
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:50.500]   Well, I don't know if we are yet or if it's just posturing. I mean it hasn't it's coming. You think so it's well with canada's there
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.140]   Yep, or dear friends
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.140]   No more Canadian aluminum
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:37:01.220]   Yeah, exactly or all you really a medium aluminium well if you spell it right we wouldn't have to tariff it
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:05.700]   We got really good aluminum here. I'm not lying
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:09.300]   Yeah, I know it's it's unclear
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:14.020]   Uh, right and you know, honestly, I think the american
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:21.380]   I don't hear a lot of people saying. Uh-oh is my iphone gonna cost I I don't think that it's that price sensitive for one thing
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:28.500]   Uh, I mean my god this iphone 10 is a thousand dollars. That's the you got a point there. Yeah, so it's an interesting
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:32.420]   Yeah, and then um
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:37.220]   I think people are honestly I think more worried about their uh retirement
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.740]   funds
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:41.220]   And they're they're 401ks and all of that
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:45.540]   And but the problem is that could also be collateral damage in a trade war
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:51.620]   Well, I heard somebody on msbc as I was driving here speedily to get to the show say that um
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:57.620]   The 40 40 40 odd percent that trump has he calls them the 401k voters
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:02.660]   There's always a 401k is in good shape. You know, that's what that's why he's not the right
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.980]   But will it will it be is a good question?
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.940]   Uh, if you look at apples, uh, stock price over the last month it has come down a bit
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.660]   um
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.580]   Probably over these trade fears, but again the iphone is so far exempt
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:20.660]   So I you know, it's just it's so hard to uh
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:26.340]   So hard to figure this stuff out to be honest with you. I don't I don't understand any of it
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:29.220]   I should read more facebook
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:30.740]   Yes
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.940]   Well, I got another question for you have you been playing with iG tv?
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.580]   There's a good one. What do you guys think?
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:43.220]   Uh, and are you using I know you do the friday night youtube videos you're looking at iG tv is another venue for you
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:49.620]   I actually planned on releasing a video with my thoughts on this but in but in short
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:53.860]   Well, you're doing it here and well, you can edit it and put it on iG tv
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:56.980]   No
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:58.980]   You have to turn the ants monitor this way
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.980]   We actually posted some stuff on iG tv
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:07.700]   Uh, I guess our people are have jumped on the iG tv bandwagon
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:11.780]   But because it's vertical video and we shoot normally like oh you
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:17.780]   We were the edges are cut off on all the lower thirds and all the information is weird have to plan all of that and
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:21.060]   I think it's a decent idea, but you have to
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:24.100]   Plan forward and and also figure out
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:30.500]   What your strategy is because I personally don't want my youtube content
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:35.300]   To be replaced by iG tv i'd rather use iG tv
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:39.460]   As an option to get you over to my youtube content
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:42.500]   Or use it the way I did with today's video
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:49.540]   Is just giving you a behind the scenes and a thought process kind of quick tip and tricks because I don't think anybody's going to watch
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:53.860]   Something on their phone for 10 minutes or eight minutes or five minutes like that
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.460]   You're just not going to do it
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:40:01.700]   But I could still give you two minutes something like that of decent content in that same
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:08.340]   Aspect ratio without an issue as long as I plan for it and make sure that I shoot in that particular aspect ratio
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:12.260]   This is uh, what if this right now i got is i'm watching you
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:18.740]   No, what are you looking at look at him? I'm not there you go. Yeah, there it is. That's this morning. Yeah, that's this morning
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.380]   So a 16 views two comments
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:28.340]   Uh, it's a couple of minutes long get out earlier or stay out later. I like right. I like that
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:31.460]   Uh
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.660]   I know i know i know
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:35.300]   By the way, I keep doing that you got to swipe up from the middle
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:38.260]   And then you can and then you can see the other stuff
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:42.900]   I'm not sure by the way. You were number one on for me. Look at that
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:46.900]   So that's where you that's where you want to be. I don't know how they know
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.340]   I don't know how they know there here's another uh, uh, twit review. So we putting we're
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.580]   We're oh look. They I
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.620]   That looks great. Yeah, they did a little editing to make sure it all fit in
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.500]   You are cheating
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.340]   Because we're using
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:08.500]   Well, the other thing about it is it doesn't have live streaming you it is designed for you to upload video, right?
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.700]   I've done live streaming on i know you can live tv. Sorry
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:13.860]   No, i live stream on instagram
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:18.020]   But what i and they say i think that there will be live streaming but right now what happens
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.620]   Is you uh now look at this that's really cheating
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.380]   They have
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.540]   Yeah, they have uh landscape video
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.300]   On that's you know, that's not gonna work shira
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:32.500]   Yeah, that's a more like a go pro knows what they're doing
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.860]   Justine of course she knows what she's eating course is on top of us
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.620]   So what is this is this a challenge to youtube is it a challenge to?
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:43.540]   Allegedly snapchat. What's it a challenge to?
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:52.180]   What is it gonna be more so towards youtube because youtube i'm not youtube because instagram went directly to the big youtube creators
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.620]   It said hey
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.940]   This is what we're getting ready to do. So can you jump on board and mr
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:02.500]   Marquez brownlee was one of those people right away. Yep right away right away
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.620]   Big
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:11.300]   Right. Well, tell us about vidcon. I'll try to stop cause i g tv came out at vidcon, right?
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:16.500]   Yes, yes, so what was the reaction there vidcon? Which is really a youtube event pretty much
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:19.380]   Well, this is an interesting thing it really i saw it was on one panel
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:24.820]   Where the moderator up at the industry track said you know, this always was seen as the as a youtube conference youtube conference
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:28.420]   Not really this year because as we as we listed last week
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:30.900]   Everybody's doing video
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:35.380]   uh i g tv had a huge booth of you know, really tall vertical monitors
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:39.300]   They had a lounge just like youtube
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:43.300]   They had their own lounge on swag somewhere i've got a t-shirt here
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:45.220]   um
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.500]   and uh
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.860]   So
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:54.020]   No, there was talk about every platform wasn't just youtube and and on youtube they didn't send Susan were just king this year
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:57.620]   They sent they had a product and they really didn't make any announcements
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:02.660]   And i'm really struggling in everything youtube announced you had to have either 10,000 or 100,000
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:04.340]   uh
[01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:08.980]   Subscribers and that's it can i have a hundred thousand subscribers you could charge $4.99 a month
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:13.860]   And uh have subscriptions which is aimed at patreon i would guess
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:18.980]   Right. Yeah, so i saw i saw jack there and he was kind of rolling his eyes a little bit saying everybody's doing
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:21.540]   No
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.020]   Um
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.500]   Go ahead
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:30.980]   Well, just real quickly so by the way, I think that that notion of charging you know, i'm not a big fan of paywalls
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:36.340]   But but patreonage i do think has real value and i think there's a new model of warning here
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:40.980]   In being able to charge on on youtube we'll see whether it works or not, but also facebook groups
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:46.980]   I think it's an opportunity for media to start charging for if it's valuable enough if it's good if it's a gate
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.260]   So that's that's an interesting model. It's come out across both those
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:55.620]   What are what is it say i mean youtube a lot of the reason why people
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:59.460]   Are there creators are there is because they get revenue
[01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:04.100]   I mean the reason why lots of them have moved over to facebook watch is because there's no revenue
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:11.060]   Or amazon had a big presence they had a they had the entire lounge on what is amazon's offering twitch is that it?
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:13.940]   No, no amazon's offering merch
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:16.180]   merch
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:18.180]   Yeah, your own merch
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.300]   So the idea is you in twitch where
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:28.580]   I think it's called twitch prime, you know, if you see if you follow someone on twitch, you know, that's another way of
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:30.420]   of um
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:36.020]   Contributing to the people you follow by using twitch prime so all of your purchases send is a couple nickels
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.620]   To whoever you follow on twitch, you know, it's one leg up and it sounds like
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:48.900]   You correct me from ram your our local expert that if you're a creator you don't want to look at any one platform
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:50.900]   You don't want an exclusive with anybody
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:57.540]   You want to use each platform for what it's best for igtv a good way to promote to push people towards your youtube
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:04.340]   That's that's my theory and that's the strategy i use because each of those platforms have individual audiences
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:10.180]   You know the people that follow me on twitter are not the same that follow me over on google plus
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.340]   Yes, I still use google plus
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:15.620]   You have to tell you this terrorist sand
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:25.540]   You know, it's a big difference and when I go through my week of planning out content creation
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:30.420]   You know, I try to figure out okay once I got this piece of content
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:32.980]   Where am I going to share and how i'm going to share it?
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:34.980]   You know because I could just that's the right way to do it
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:39.380]   But it's expensive and right or just put some personality behind it and put it on
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:45.940]   If i'm gonna put it on instagram, I got to figure out a clever way to put it there to make it relevant those folks on instagram
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:48.820]   But it's my course a lot more thought than for you
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:52.260]   What's that?
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:57.300]   It sounds like you're pretty dedicated to youtube like that. That's your sort of main home. Is that right?
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.020]   For now it is because it's the easiest platform for me to
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.180]   to share
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:07.460]   a little bit that I know and what i've learned and
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:15.220]   Being able to to live stream pretty seamlessly has been it's been great and plus the whole se seo model behind it
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.700]   You know, it's the second largest search engine on there
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:21.780]   Yeah, are you bothered by what looks like a
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:26.900]   Effort on youtube's part to keep people from mentioning other streams and other places
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:34.500]   Uh, they banned people for saying come watch my twitch stream for instance. Yeah, I saw I saw a bunch of big channels
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.660]   Take a hit because of that and
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:43.700]   I guess youtube has the right to do that because it is their product that you're trying to profit off of
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.700]   you know
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:49.860]   I don't I don't think about it too much, but it sort of made sense to me
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.380]   You know if i'm going to sit there and be touting my ipad
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:59.380]   I'm not necessarily going to talk about just how great google maps is on it versus apple maps
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.700]   Apple might not like that
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:03.540]   This is though a little bit
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:10.820]   Encounter to what you just said which is the best thing for a creator to do is to be in a bunch of platforms use the platform natively appropriately
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:16.580]   But if the platform's point of view and you could see this in the IG tv announcement which featured
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:21.220]   Creators in the and i'm sure at vidcon which features creators
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:26.020]   It's the superstars of individual platforms that make the platforms happy they want
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:28.900]   They want you to be loyal
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.420]   Yeah
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:37.380]   It's and and for me. I will say i'll be more loyal to youtube just because of you know what I provide
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:46.580]   Um, I don't think my long form content is a good fit on instagram because instagram or i g tv whatever you want to call it
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.260]   Is people?
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:55.940]   Scrolling through with short attention spans you're literally just scrolling scrolling through you're not there to consume several minutes
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:48:00.820]   That's why the IG stories work as well as they do because they're 15 seconds at a time
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:05.780]   Right, you know, but you can take a video and put it in your instagram feed
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:10.740]   And you know hope that somebody's going to watch it because you can put up to 60 seconds
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.780]   But I guarantee you put it on the stories
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:19.460]   You get a lot more more views and clicks there because it's just the whole attention span
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:26.820]   Instagram's got to watch out because IG tv could end up being a wasteland of advertising product placement
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:35.460]   Uh, it could this is one of the big problems I have in general with instagram is a lot of these instagram stars use their popularity
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:40.260]   To basically do advertising on there. Yeah, not that we would ever do that but
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:49.060]   It just seems a little bit more advertising focused like that's the point of the feed
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:55.460]   You know, I look out a little bit because most of the people I follow on the instagram platform are
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:59.620]   Dedicated photographers because that's what I love. I love to look at
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:04.820]   The photographs. I love the craft behind you and trying to get into their head to see
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.820]   How did they come up with that particular shot? How did they come up with that composition and most of those folks?
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.820]   They're not really doing a lot of the the
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:16.420]   Adworthy stuff, you know every now and then they'll do a story
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:20.340]   To show you the behind the scenes, but beyond that
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:25.700]   This is you know, they'll post something every other day that kind of thing because they're working on their craft
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:30.180]   And then they're going to share it, you know, they're not doing a whole lot of spam and and stuff like that
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:35.540]   No, that's exactly who I follow and I guess that's the saving grace of instagram
[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:39.140]   Is you only see what you follow minus the ad every eight?
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:44.500]   I get that little banner at the top that says so and so just posted on IGTV
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:51.860]   And i've now trained myself to ignore that because most of the time miss people that i'm not dad interested in I followed them
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.100]   But i'm not that interested in them
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:59.860]   Well, that is free wrap lift did it. I probably look that is the different model of IGTV because it has this
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.740]   The following tab is just one of
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:09.380]   You know three for you following and popular a lot of the content on IGTV is not from people you follow but
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:14.260]   Nope, but from people they are promoting like this aunt prueck guy
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.300]   I will also say
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:25.300]   Clemson and I get nothing from clumps in university, but they are doing a really good job on IGTV and how they're using it
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.860]   Really? They how they do they planned it you can tell they sat down
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:37.380]   And planned it out far as how they want to make this shot work and and go through their scripts. I bet they started with snapchat though, didn't they?
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.100]   um more so with uh
[01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:45.540]   I think it was snapchat, but they got the clumps in social media team
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:52.020]   Got really really big a couple years ago and they ended up at adobe max adobe said please come out here
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:58.100]   And show everybody how are you creating this great content and come to find out they were using adobe products and all that good stuff
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:03.460]   But it's just the thought process that goes into it is what what really sets them apart
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:08.180]   And now all of the little college colleges and whatnot are doing the same type of thing
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:15.540]   Because that's how you get players to come there. You know, they see your social media presence. All right, that's smart
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:23.300]   I I think that if at least my bet is if you were to look at what IGTV is aimed at it is
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:26.420]   It is aimed to be the final nail in the snap coffin
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:35.060]   That and not because creators will move there because a lot of the people use snapchat use snapchat because it's it's it's not so public
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:40.980]   Right, but that's where the revenue comes from is all the brands like clemse and everybody else
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:47.220]   Putting their stuff in the discover tab and and I guarantee you that's the plan for IGTV
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:50.020]   It's let's just suck all the revenue out of snap. Yeah
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:53.860]   Seems like that's been the plan from day one right now, you know, right
[01:51:53.860 --> 01:52:01.860]   So that if you if you I I've been thinking about it. It's not targeted at youtube because people like you will use both
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:10.660]   Uh, it is not gonna hurt instagram because it's very different. It's really it's like oh, let's say get another icon on the desktop
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:15.780]   Another set of notifications and be let's put let's let's kill you take snap has a chance
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:21.860]   Not at this point now. It's funny though. I may not be the right person to ask because uh
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:26.500]   It's on the demographic. It's the demographic young people love snap and my kids still use a snap
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:32.900]   My kids still use it. Yeah. Yeah, mine too for private communication though, right? Right? So see that's a problem
[01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:38.820]   So I think they're like I think there's still a use case for that to still use case for the sort of oh I agree
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:44.580]   So if you're instagram, you know that you can't or facebook you can't kill that because facebook's very much the opposite
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:49.300]   But you can kill their revenue revenue, right? How do you generate revenue after the revenue?
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:55.060]   Means sharing short snaps of themselves doing something goofy like not it's not that there's not a need
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.380]   Yeah, it is a day big business. Yeah
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.540]   Not that I should be concerned about the business model, but it's just yeah
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.500]   I don't I don't think it bodes well for the long-term survival of snap
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:08.020]   I wanted to mention regarding vidcon
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:10.020]   Uh
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:16.980]   I think the last time I was on here we discussed, you know using a Chromebook for what I do in the content creation. Oh, yeah
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.300]   I was like you bring these up. Yes. Yes. Yes. And
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:27.300]   I had a I had a one of those virtual conference calls with the dobe prior to vidcon and the whole embargo stuff or whatever
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:33.060]   But they released project rush and basically it's allowing you to have
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:40.340]   a video editor on your mobile devices, but it's it's just not stripped down. It's pretty that gum powerful
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:44.500]   Links into your creative cloud account and all of that stuff
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:48.500]   But not only can you do it on ios and android?
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:54.500]   But you can also use a Chromebook with the the um, google play version of it
[01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:58.020]   Or you're gonna end up being able to do it on the web as well
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:01.060]   And this is not just just simple iMovie
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:04.100]   Like video editing this is you can put
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:11.460]   Motion graphics and things like that in it as well and it's I was so pumped up
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:15.460]   During that presentation and just are you in the beta?
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:18.100]   Yes, sir. I signed up for it
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:22.740]   I wrote about it briefly over on tech republic if anybody in the chat room wants to check that out
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:29.540]   But it's I'm just so excited about it because now I I can I have the chance to grab my Chromebook
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:33.460]   And do some nice quick video that it's does the edit i have locally
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.940]   Sorry, does the edit in this locally?
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:38.100]   Right, it's okay
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:43.860]   But you can make some changes in your you can make some changes to your cloud stuff to sync up to later
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.180]   Like if I want to change a template today
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:50.340]   And then I can pull it down tomorrow on another device and work with it
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:52.420]   But if I want to change it tomorrow, I can
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:56.100]   Change it send it back up to the cloud and it'll in little stay there
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:00.820]   You know because I personally I use a lot of different lower thirds and templates
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:03.940]   Motion graphics inside of my videos right now
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:06.900]   That are just just sort of standard things
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:14.900]   And it would be nice if I could grab those things when I'm in a hotel somewhere and actually use them instead instead of having to be on my
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:17.940]   Beast right here
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:22.820]   I you know, I don't know how I missed this. I did not I'm so glad you brought this up. I had no idea
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.380]   So this is timeline style editing
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.420]   Yep, how does it compare to premiere?
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:31.620]   Well, this is a lighter version of premiere
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:38.180]   But in addition to that you get a lighter version of adobe audition to edit audio inside of it
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:41.300]   Yeah, you know, so in like they have this
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:48.260]   Auto doken auto ducking feature inside of audition right now that easily integrates in premiere pro
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:52.340]   I use it all the time what if you don't know what audio auto ducking is it's
[01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:58.100]   You have a video and you have your music bed below it and if somebody starts
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:04.180]   Talking in your video the music automatically ducks down to her lower gain
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:07.460]   And when they stop talking it
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:13.780]   Automatically comes back up because this transitioned to another scene you get that functionality in project rush
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:18.260]   At least laugh at that though. How hard is it to just duck the audio down a little bit?
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:23.060]   Oh, trust me when you're going through clips after clip after clip
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:26.340]   It takes a lot of time any automation is a good thing
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.500]   It takes up a lot of time
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.180]   It is compatible with premiere
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:33.060]   It looks like that you can do it on mobile as well as
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:36.500]   Desktop as well as chrome and that all the edits sync
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:40.660]   So it's clearly post, you know saving an edit decision list or some kind
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:48.180]   So kind of like adobe lightroom where you can make edits on a mobile device, but then they says android is coming soon
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.620]   Yeah
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:51.620]   Phone tablet
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:56.180]   Before the end of the year. I'm I think they told me like no
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:57:00.100]   Was it no vember they told me have you posted videos with it yet?
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:05.700]   No, they they haven't released the beta just yet. Oh, I get it up for it
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:10.260]   Okay, but the second I get that email. You better believe I already got some files ready
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:15.540]   They say please provide a link to a recent video you shared online. Can I just put twit?
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:21.460]   You probably can do that. I just put me we are at the yolaport
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:25.060]   Well, I would love to I've signed up, but we'll see if I can get it
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.780]   I can throw out everything you have and just get chromebooks. Leo just get rid all
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:31.140]   That's just when they change our whole perspective on this
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.220]   Wow
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:37.940]   And that's what that's what I've been begging for. I was like the chromebooks are great devices and
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:43.860]   There's always just one load of hiccup when it comes to creating content now if you're a writer
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:48.180]   It's no big deal. You can just open up google docs and write your story
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:54.660]   But when it comes to editing raw files from your canon camera, you have a few limited options
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:59.620]   You know and then getting into the world of video editing that was a whole different ball of wax
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:03.700]   This is really what makes you want to buy the higher end chromebooks
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:05.540]   Yeah
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.820]   Well, but well, we'll have to see when the software comes out, but there's
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:12.340]   Chromebook doesn't run software locally does it?
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:17.140]   Well, this is yeah, it could only be a chrome extension
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:22.500]   Which means if you have to be the word, I'm sorry the server is going to have to do the work
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:25.140]   This has to be server based
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:28.020]   Well, that's fine. I don't have a problem with that
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:35.060]   But it's something is this reading something locally. God. Now. I gotta go back and look through my notes
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:40.900]   Well, they don't remember. Yeah through it and it said that there aren't things that you can do locally
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:43.140]   Well, sure. I mean a chrome extension
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:47.940]   Internet everybody's not going to have any internet. Yeah, you can have offline editing in chrome
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:53.940]   Yeah, and then push it up to the cloud. Yeah, but most crumbles don't have the horsepower to
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:55.380]   to
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:59:00.900]   Do much so I know this would be very interesting to see how it works on a Chromebook. It may not really be intended for a Chromebook
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.340]   Is it I just put up the the youtube the vidcon
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:10.660]   Presentation of it. Okay. I will be I will be looking at that it does say desktop or laptop
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:14.180]   So it sounds like it doesn't specifically mention chrome OS
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.820]   So it sounds like it's just
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:19.460]   Do it in a browser
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:26.020]   That's that's the next goal is a browser first is the mobile devices and then using it on a Chromebook inside of the
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:28.260]   the
[01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.860]   Google Play apps
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:34.420]   On and on Chromebook whatever it's called. I cannot remember and done that in a long time
[01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:38.020]   But then later be able to do that in a browser
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:44.020]   Let's take a little break. I'm gonna give you a pass ant pro it. That is your thing of the week. I think
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:49.700]   It was a good project rush. I'm excited. I just signed up. That's exciting
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:54.500]   But if you want to come up with another one you can nath you and then of course, uh, jeff if you have a number
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:59.540]   We're gonna already got all right. I like it and we are gonna do an ad for lighthouse
[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:03.780]   I'm very pleased actually to see that lighthouse is back. I use the lighthouse effect
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:06.660]   I was just I was just looking at my lighthouse at home because
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:10.820]   It's uh, nobody's home and it said there was there was activity
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:13.300]   I got a notification there was activity
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:20.660]   While nobody was home. So I wanted to see lighthouse is a smart camera that can distinguish between humans
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:22.660]   and uh
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.660]   and pets and people and
[02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:25.780]   uh
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:29.460]   So I can see for instance show me people within the last 24 hours
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:34.340]   I have my lighthouse pointed at the front door in my office where my iMac pro sits
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:37.860]   I don't want anybody stealing my iMac pro and all that's good
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:42.340]   It's just it's just the housekeepers doing the the bimonthly vacuuming
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:45.140]   And it's nice to see that they're actually doing my office
[02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:49.540]   So I can keep track of that but this is so cool lighthouse knows who we are
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:52.980]   So one of the issues for lisa having a camera in the house
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:55.300]   She said I don't want a camera on in the house when i'm home
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.900]   So the minute lisa or i comes home the camera turns off
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:02.900]   I could see events and even better. I can set up
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:08.100]   Notifications anything happened while I was gone ping me if you see anything between 10 and 5
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:13.140]   Do you see any new people because it knows who it's seen before it even knows pets
[02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:16.820]   What did the dog do while I was gone or the cat
[02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:21.780]   Ping me if you don't see the cat by 10 ping me if you see the kids with the cat
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:26.980]   What did the kids do when I was gone? There's another nice feature for kids younger kids, especially love it
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:32.900]   The lighthouse not only has a very good high quality camera and night vision and 3d sensing
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:35.860]   It's got actual uh time of flight
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:38.580]   3d imaging in it
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:44.020]   So that's how it knows people and animals versus you know objects, but you can even
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:49.220]   Record it can even recognize waving. So if the kids go up to the lighthouse and wave at it
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:51.060]   You'll get a notification
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:56.260]   You know michael's waving at us and then it has a speaker and a microphone you can talk to them too
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:02:02.580]   This is 3d sensing and ai technology that came from self-driving cars one of the founders of lighthouse
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:08.500]   Was actually a competitor in the grand challenge the arper grand challenge the self-driving vehicles
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:11.060]   There really is nothing like the lighthouse out there
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:16.660]   It has been praised as the best ai home security around it frankly is the one I use at home
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:21.060]   And you can get a hundred dollars off your very own lighthouse right now if you go to light that house
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:26.660]   Only through july 9th. It's a special independence day sale
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:34.740]   It's i'm like their tagline the intelligence may be artificial, but the savings are real light dot house
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:38.740]   For a hundred dollars off your very own lighthouse
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:43.060]   Camera there's no special offer code. This is good for anybody tell all your friends
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:48.420]   This is the security. I recommend I use and I've set other people up with
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:52.260]   It's the first camera that lets you just ask what you want to know
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:58.900]   You can go through 30 days of video history just by asking natural questions what happened when I was gone
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:02.900]   Tell me if you see somebody in the house between noon and two
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:08.100]   Lighthouse is great because you don't get more notifications than you want
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:13.460]   You only get notifications for things you specifically want to see and I love it that the camera turns off when we go home
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:19.140]   So our privacy is 100 protected www.light.house
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:23.460]   For $100 off your own lighthouse camera, but
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:27.940]   This is a special for independence day. You only have through july 9th
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:32.660]   So do not delay and we're thrilled to have lighthouse on the network
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:37.060]   We actually were part of their launch helped them get off the ground and in the early days
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:41.060]   We had to say things like sign up to get your lighthouse the minute it's available
[02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:47.780]   But now they're in stock and there's plenty of them. So go get one. It's a good deal light dot house
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:52.980]   Matthew engraving anything you want to tell us about a pick of the week a book you like
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:59.140]   I was actually looking for this was on the rundown. I noticed did anybody have any
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:05.940]   bitcoins in mount gox by any chance before it went under I did not but I know they lost
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:09.300]   A huge amount of money. Yeah a billion or so
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:14.580]   Worth I think um I think at the time it was about 475 million
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:19.140]   And uh, so basically all vanished and then
[02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:24.020]   Um, they found some but it all got tied up in bankruptcy court
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:29.380]   So now it appears that that has been unfrozen and so they're going to start
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:35.620]   Giving people back some of those bitcoins. It it I think it's we're talking multiple billions
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:39.460]   Uh of bitcoins that they're going to start doubling down. I guess
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:42.020]   I had some but I can't find the
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:47.060]   Pass for the key and so yeah, I guess yeah, you have to prove ownership, right?
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.820]   Yeah
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:52.500]   So what's funny is they didn't recover all the bitcoins lost
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:56.180]   But because bitcoin has gone up so much since then
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:05:00.900]   Everybody who could prove the ownership can get re can get made whole at least for the amount
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:06.660]   It was worth when they lost it. Yeah, they lost 850 000 and they only found 200 000
[02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:08.660]   But it's worth orders of magnitude more
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:15.060]   This wild it's wild. So by the way, uh, that actually
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:20.500]   Caused bitcoin to go down on friday that announcement by nearly 8
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:22.660]   Because
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:28.260]   Yeah, a lot more a lot more bitcoin that means uh, oh, it's going to be worth a lot less
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.740]   So that hit that hit the price pretty hard
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:33.300]   Jeff you got a number for us. Yeah
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:38.660]   First I mean to put in a plug again for the intelligent square debate. I put up a link on the
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:41.380]   rundown and the url
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:46.820]   For everybody might want to go there. Oh, I lost it. I could find intelligent squared
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:49.380]   Dot
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.380]   Us dot org, right?
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:56.340]   Yeah, and the smart url is smart url dot it slash social media debate
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:58.980]   SM and d up
[02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:04.980]   I start in minute 38, but we lost we lost that's so this is cool. So this I didn't so intelligence
[02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:10.020]   They're a US kind of work. They're there are formal debates. There's two on one side two on the other side
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:13.060]   You do an opening statement then you know reverse in the your question
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:18.260]   The audience votes beforehand what their opinion is and then whoever gets the delta from the audience wins the debate
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:20.500]   Oh, and they talk about everything we talk about
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:24.180]   This is a lot of topics. It's about it's about trying to have civil informed
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:30.580]   Uh productive conversation. So I like them as an organization. They're very good. They do and they do a lot of good debates
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:37.540]   This is I'm this I'm so glad they did this. This was a show I really wanted to do and I wanted to have father Robert who's a Jesuit
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:43.620]   Be the moderator for a debate panel, but it was just probably logistically too difficult
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:47.140]   So this is this that's really cool that they've done this. That's really great. They're good
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:51.780]   Yeah, are they they're good debaters the Jesuits
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:55.060]   Yes, that's why I wanted Robert to do it
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:03.700]   So the number is that now a six figure income in for families in the Bay Area puts you in poverty
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:05.780]   What?
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:08.580]   That's some both if you earn 170
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:13.700]   117 000 in the Bay Area you qualify as low income
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:16.340]   I agree
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:18.100]   Yeah, that's absolutely
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:19.700]   Do you qualify for benefits?
[02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:24.420]   No, I think it just means that that uh, I think I would guess maybe low income housing
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:27.060]   If any existed
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:30.340]   My son's living in an apartment in north beach
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:35.220]   And he has two roommates as an apartment intended really for one one one person
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:42.500]   Uh, and it's the only way it can be affordable, but he loves living in north beach. So that's a great city great pasta
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:48.340]   I talked to one of my my graduates has been out of the school like eight nine years now and has a great really good career
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:53.220]   Technology jurist and but she said i'm tired of the stuff roommates at this point in my life. Oh, yeah
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:57.620]   Well when a median fam price for a single family home in the Bay Area is
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:00.500]   935 000
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:02.580]   You can see why people have roommates
[02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:09.060]   So this is clearly a bigger problem for the technology companies because that's the way people were there and you know coming from Aspen where they have
[02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:12.740]   I'm gonna start a meme convincing people they do faceless for dogs
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:17.860]   They don't they don't here's a here's a house
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:22.500]   Complete with leaks in the roof that sold for 1.23 million
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:30.420]   I don't know six competing offers all over asking price obviously it's a teardown, right?
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:34.580]   Yes, I like although I keep the chain link fence it adds a certain
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:38.020]   Certain land is like
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:44.340]   Geez Louise. They're not making it anymore. Well now you know why we're in petaluma, right?
[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:51.060]   So is it more expensive than New York City though, Jeff? Oh, I think so. No. Yeah, really? I think so. Wow
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:55.940]   Well, I didn't know I was talking to a friend of mine Emily Parker who's on the the bait with me. I
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:58.660]   I Q squared
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:04.020]   Said that Tokyo was now less expensive than a lot less expensive because the economy's been the I'd rather live in Tokyo
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:06.500]   So it's less expensive. I'm on my way
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:13.300]   Go into average average average has price in Toronto is 800 grand. Oh, it's pretty hot
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:17.220]   I should have bought I almost bought there years and years ago
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:23.540]   Just forgot like a like got a way place. I so wish I had oh god. I wish I had when I used to work down there 10 years ago
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:30.740]   There were a lot of condos springing. Yes. Yeah, always is that still there's more there are more. Yeah. Yeah
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:33.700]   tons of high-rise condo development. Yeah
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:39.140]   And you said you still had something even though you gave us so much with the rush
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:42.340]   I do I do um
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:46.900]   And I'll be quick because it's two things the first one is if you're using amazon
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:52.580]   I'm sure everybody in this audience knows about smile dot amazon.com and that's where it takes
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:57.060]   Whatever you purchase and puts a little percentage towards whatever
[02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:03.620]   Charity or what have you that you'd like to support I do doctors without borders with my purchase something right?
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:08.500]   Right and I'd like to urge since we were talking about kylo fin earlier
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:11.140]   Is to take a look at your local
[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:16.500]   animal shelter because those folks had to spend a ton of money and
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:18.980]   at least they do here and
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:21.860]   The shelter that I got kylo from they spent a ton of money
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:27.700]   To help make sure he was healthy when um before I got him and then right after I got him
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:34.420]   This turd decided he wanted to to swallow a football glove and a headphone cover
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:42.100]   You know all of a sudden he needed surgery and the shelter said don't worry about it. We'll take care of the surgery
[02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:44.180]   I'm like as I can't afford that
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:50.580]   And they just took care of and he's two years later. He's just fine and you know, so you're all of my
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:55.140]   Amazon stuff goes towards my local animal shelter
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:11:00.180]   Um, so that's one and the other one is my good friend charlie does a podcast
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:05.380]   um for the geek community he calls it geek questionnaire.com
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:07.860]   and um
[02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:13.780]   It's based on a lot of sci-fi stuff. They read a ton of different books and a lot of just geek culture
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:18.020]   Had the time I don't know what the heck they're talking about because i'm not that cool
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:24.100]   But i've been on that show a few times and it's always entertaining just to listen to the answers that people
