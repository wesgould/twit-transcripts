[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   This week in Google, the show where we talk about Google the cloud, the cloud of verse.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   When is Gina coming back for an episode? Is it next month? Next week?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Uh, let me take a look at this schedule.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I believe it is.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Next week?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Yay!
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Hey, Jeff and I miss Gina. But don't worry, we've got great people in her place.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   He's got his Chromebook Pixel. He's padding it because we've compelled him to use
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   an unnamed computer for his Skype.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Liberal, Tommy computer.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But boy, doesn't that look good?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Oh, rub it in.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   That's okay. It's okay.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Just think of this as a dedicated video conferencing device.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Not a computer.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And you never have to use this.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Look, our Tri-Castor runs on a Windows machine.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   But you never know it.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You never know it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We're running Windows 7.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Kooties.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Jeff is the author of Public Parts.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   What would Google do?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Gutenberg the Geek? And his latest Geek Sparing Gifts?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Reimagining news in the modern world.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Ain't that exciting?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Ain't that the greatest Buzzmachine.com is his blog?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Look who's here.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Mike Elgin, our news director from TNT.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Mike is the most popular man on Google+ practically.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yep.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Me and Lady Gaga.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   We're the most popular man.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Also, a writer at Computer World and other magazines.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   He's an expert in the cloud and in Google.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We should get you on more.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I just don't want to overburden you because you have to do TNT every Monday through Friday.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   This show is like a vacation on Tropical Island.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's like a joy.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It is a joy.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It is a joy.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And boy, is it going to be a...
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We've got whipped cream and cherries on the list.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Let's start with the FCC.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Tom Wheeler in an editorial published on Wired, clearly reaching out to us.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yes.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   To the geeks.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Saying, you know, it's interesting.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Dan Gilmore wrote an article apologizing to Tom Wheeler for mischaracterizing him as a
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   shill.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I wonder, I guess...
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   That's very Dan.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's very neat to do.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I guess Oliver was going to have to say, I'm sorry for calling you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   What are you calling me?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Dingo?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   John Oliver is going to have...
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He's off the air right now.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   He's in hiatus.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   But when he comes back, he's going to have to say, I'm sorry I called you a dingo.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Well, the devil is in the details.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Let's see the full language.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   But so far, so good.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Well, now I'm scared.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   We got what we wanted.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Tom Wheeler has agreed to use Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934 while tailoring
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.480]   it for the 21st century in order to create a competitive network in order to prevent fast
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   lane prioritization.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.840]   And you know, it's actually interesting.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.160]   He refers to, and I had forgotten this, a startup that he did in the 80s called Naboo.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.200]   This is the most fascinating part to me is that what happened is that he tried to do
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.440]   high speed back in the day, but it required working with cable companies and cable companies
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.160]   effed them and it came home to roost.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   And AOL beat him.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.680]   He said, we were delivering 1.5 megabits per second back in the 80s.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.680]   That was amazing.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.760]   Steve Case was dial up.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.040]   And Case, Case, Wheeler says, Case told me at the time, we used to worry a lot about
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.320]   Naboo, but Naboo went broke while AOL became obviously very successful.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.160]   And Wheeler writes why that is highlights the fundamental problem with allowing networks
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.400]   to act as gatekeepers while delivering better service.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.440]   Naboo had to depend on cable television operators granting access to their system.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.720]   Steve Case of AOL was not only a brilliant entrepreneur, but he had access to an unlimited
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.120]   number of customers nationwide who only had to attach a modem to their phone line.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   The phone network was open because the FCC made it open.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.760]   Cable networks were closed end of story.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.160]   For Tom Wheeler to say that, kind of, to me, he gives him a lot of street cred.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.320]   He's like a sleeper cell for the EFF.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   It's kind of great, right?
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.320]   We thought that he was going to be a sellout because he worked in the industry and all
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   that.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.400]   But this experience from early in his career, the permissionless development, the ability
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.480]   to reach people on an open network, he got it in his soul and it came back.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480]   And God bless him.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.760]   Let's just hope it stays this way.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.960]   And the phone companies, you know, and the cable companies, you screwed yourselves, guys.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.280]   But you could have been nice.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.080]   You could have had a sign up that says, "Don't be evil."
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.160]   You could have had a sign up that said, "Just because we can doesn't mean we should."
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.800]   You could have had a sign up that said, "Let's not treat our customers like prisoners."
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.040]   But you didn't.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.640]   And so it's all come home to roost on the big old companies and they're all going to sue
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   the FCC.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.040]   ATT has already said it is.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.720]   They said, "If they do this, we're suing here.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   We're in."
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.400]   Here's an interesting thing.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.960]   He's actually gone farther than some people, including Google, wanted him to go.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.040]   He says, "Using the authority of Title II, I am submitting to my colleagues, the other
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.920]   commissioners of the FCC, the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.080]   FCC.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.840]   These enforceable, bright line rules will ban paid prioritization fast lanes and the blocking
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.040]   and throttling of lawful content and services."
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   But here's where he's going.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040]   It's about to come here.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.960]   Yeah, this is really interesting.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.640]   "I propose to fully apply for the first time ever those bright line rules to mobile broadband."
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   That's a huge deal.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   Huge, huge deal.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.640]   That is huge.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   Even Google acknowledged, and it's Amicus filing with Verizon, that broadband should be
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640]   treated differently.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   Well, that's a bit different.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   Right.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   And Google's devil's deal with Verizon.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.360]   That was, I've never been more ashamed of Google.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   I remember that.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.040]   And at that moment, and I screamed about it on the show, it was a moment of prostitution
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.280]   to try to make nice to phone companies.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.680]   It was never going to yield anything.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.000]   But Google said, "We'll apply that neutrality to wired line, not to mobile."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And it was wrong.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.800]   It was evil.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.040]   And God bless Tom Wheeler is less evil than Google right now.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   For now.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.480]   Two things to look out for.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.120]   One of them is coming up to your punchline of them embracing mobile was the fact that
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.440]   it says that any sort of legal, we have to allow it.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   Legal content.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.960]   So that is determined by lawmakers.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.520]   And the lawmakers are going to be the fly in the ointment here.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   It's Congress.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.920]   And a minority of Republicans in Congress are going to want to attack and destroy this.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:37.200]   And of course, the lobbyists, Wheeler's former colleagues, are going to be attacking Congress
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.280]   in all this.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.120]   And so that's risky.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:47.080]   Secondly, Wheeler said specifically that what I have given the future FCC chairman can
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.480]   take it away in a couple of years.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.560]   And so that makes me nervous.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.720]   The precedent is huge though.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.840]   It gives it a lot of weight and gives us a good shot of having net neutrality going forward.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.400]   But you have to realize that if we didn't get net neutrality right now, we would never
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.840]   get it.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.200]   And most countries are leaning toward no net neutrality because once again, as is, you
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.320]   know, the case in the United States and everywhere, the companies, there's so much money to be
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   made in screening the consumer and and and probably Europe to his regulatory credit is
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   going for net neutrality all around.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.320]   I saw it in the new digital head in Europe, and I'm scared with what he's going to do.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.040]   I think he's going to do a European wide get ready for it.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.920]   Nice, don't shoot threat.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.800]   But but they sing the song of net neutrality in Europe.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.000]   I think that we were behind on that.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.160]   And this might put us back to where we ought to be.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.880]   I got the feeling that they started to go strong with net neutrality early in last year
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.400]   and in spring of last year.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.160]   And then by the end of the year, they were saying, you know, on second thought, maybe
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.240]   we ought to just kind of tinker with it a little bit.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.800]   Well, that's that's the risk.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   And so that's problematic.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.560]   But I mean, it's it's it remains to be seen.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.440]   I think the biggest thing is that people can't relax now.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.720]   Everybody who wrote letters right to your member of Congress exactly because now is when we
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.200]   win it or lose it.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.000]   Now he did do first when I read the headline, I went gulp because we got what we wanted,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.560]   but now I'm nervous about what the other side has said all along, which is you don't
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.000]   want the federal government, especially the FCC regulating the internet because there's
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.160]   all sorts of stuff entitled to this gives him power to do.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.560]   He was very clear that he intends to honor President Obama's notion of forbearance, not
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.800]   enforcing everything.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.560]   He says he wants to create incentive for broadband operators to invest.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.600]   So he's going to modernize title tool.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.320]   For instance, no rate regulation.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   This was something everybody was a little worried about.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   That's critical for them.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.680]   No tariffs, no last mile unbundling.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.680]   What's that?
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.680]   Well, that's written.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.160]   I think this one means it.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.720]   Tell me if I'm wrong, chat room, but in Britain, BT puts the fiber or puts the cable into your
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.240]   house, but but it's like your power line.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.160]   Why wouldn't we want last mile unbundling?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160]   I think we would.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.640]   But I think that's a big stop to the cable companies and that's what it takes.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.480]   He's saying if you spent the money, the capital investment to get the last mile, you're going
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.680]   to continue to own that last mile.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   And that is true that me and the FCC decided this the last time this came up many more
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.240]   than a decade ago, they gave a monopoly to the cable companies in every region saying,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.360]   look, you're going to invest a lot of money and infrastructure.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.760]   You need to be able to monetize.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.200]   That was what they saw as necessary to incent investment.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.480]   He said, but over the last 21 years, the wireless industry has invested almost 300 billion under
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.640]   similar rules proving that modernized title to regulation can encourage investment and
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   competition.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:00.040]   I have to say last mile unbundling has happened on the why on phone companies, AT&T and others
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.560]   have to unbundle, right?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   Yes.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.560]   So I'm not convinced that that's what you mean.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560]   What do you mean?
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   You have VNOs?
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:13.080]   No, no, no, no, they, well, not in mobile, but in landline, in DSL, it's unbundled.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.760]   The last mile has been put in by AT&T or Verizon, but you can get it from Sonic, Net or DSL
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.080]   Extreme or some other provider.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080]   Right, right.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   We should not the case here.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.760]   But I would like to see that on cable.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.920]   The other important decision, which was a few days ago, which is the administration saying
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:35.200]   they're going to fight the limitations on towns over building and competing with cable
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   companies.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.000]   Municipal Internet is the right answer to all of this.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.520]   Well, so this all sounds very good.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.440]   In fact, the EFF writing today said, "Today we are celebrating Chairman Wheeler's announcement
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   signals.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.200]   The FCC is at long last making real progress on net neutrality, neutrality, but they do
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.440]   agree the battle is not over.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.360]   We need to ensure the FCC rules will actually do what is needed to protect the open Internet
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.640]   and know more."
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.480]   And I think that Mike, you're absolutely right.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.520]   This is now it's time to write your Congress' letter and say, "Good.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.200]   Now let's promote competition.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.720]   Let's promote investment.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.400]   I don't think unbundling the last mile is a bad idea."
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   Here's the thing.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.440]   I think that this is going to be made, if it hasn't already been made, into a left-right
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.800]   issue with people on the right being told that this is a government regulation.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   Right.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.480]   And there's a government regulation thing to a certain extent.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.520]   And so those reflexes are being exercised.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.480]   And this is not the issue to exercise those reflexes, in my opinion, because the alternative
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:41.600]   to so-called government regulation, where there's a level playing field essentially,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:48.440]   and where all traffic has to be treated equally, is that Comcast is in charge of determining
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.560]   these things.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   And Comcast has demonstrated that it just will screw customers over for a buck at every
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   chance it gets.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.240]   Yeah, I agree with Mike, because that's what I was saying before too.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   I think that the telecommunications industry could have avoided this.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.080]   They could have shown that they weren't evil.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.600]   I mean, there really is an attitude, is if we can, we will.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.640]   We'll charge you for every little thing.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.040]   We're going to screw you over.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.000]   We're going to treat you like prisoners.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.320]   It's a prisoner business model, like an airline prisoner business model.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.920]   And they brought it upon themselves.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.360]   No one trusts them.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.720]   No one trusts them.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.840]   They have to buy their friends in Congress.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.480]   And that's what will come to bear now.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.640]   We'll see what the power of that lobbying is.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   But Wheeler clearly heard the country speak and heard Silicon Valley speak.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640]   And then listen.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.880]   AT&T warned that Title II is far from bulletproof.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.880]   Boy, they just, they didn't pull any punches.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:56.240]   Hank Hultquist, writing on the AT&T Public Policy blog, said today we made a couple of
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:04.160]   filings at the FCC disputing its authority to reclassify ISPs as common carriers.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.960]   He says this decision is driven by political considerations.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.640]   We think they're going to do it.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.720]   But we ought to warn them, we're going to court and we don't think it's, it's sustainable.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:21.600]   We think court will overturn it just as Verizon won court with the FCC's open internet regulations.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.240]   I have to point out though that that court told Verizon or told the FCC if you were to
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.360]   pursue Title II, we might be able to support you on that.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.760]   That's why they went against them.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.320]   That's why they went against them because Title II was not the law of the land.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:46.680]   They're quoting Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in a Supreme Court decision.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:55.880]   The index, of course the dissent has no weight in law at all, but they, I think hold out
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.560]   hope that maybe Justice Scalia will support them if it goes to the Supreme Court.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.400]   I'm not worried about AT&T's lawsuit.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   I'm worried about AT&T's by the Congress budget.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.560]   They give more to campaign contributions and other financing on the other company.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.400]   Well, and okay, here's their argument.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.720]   So let's see, this doesn't sound completely wrong to me.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.400]   And again, they're quoting Justice Scalia.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.160]   He said ISPs are not merely an information service.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.440]   They're a transmission service.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.160]   He compared them to pizzerias that offer both a combination of pizza and home delivery
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.720]   or a pet store that sells dogs, but includes the leash.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.840]   I'm getting a headache.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.400]   Scalia is notorious for this.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.360]   We disagree with Scalia's view that ISPs simultaneously offer both information and telecommunications
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.680]   service as AT&T.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.320]   The FCC has long adhered to an interpretation of the statute under which these definitions
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.000]   are mutually exclusive.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.880]   You can't be both a telecommunications service, a transport and an information service.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.360]   I don't understand that analogy.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.520]   In what way does your average ISP, you know, I mean, obviously the Comcast and so on are
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.720]   serving up both content and bandwidth?
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.040]   Is that what they're talking about?
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.760]   I mean, they shouldn't be doing that.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.200]   You shouldn't get your puppy from the same place, you get the leash or whatever.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.640]   We want dumb pipes that dumb are the better and the bigger the better.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   That's what we want.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.880]   And that's what we need in order to compete with the rest of the world economically.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.000]   That's what we need in order to retain our status as an economic superpower.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   We need these things.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.120]   We can't be nickeled and dined to death by...
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   Right.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   Sorry.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.120]   No, go ahead.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:51.040]   Dumb pipes are commodity and they know that and the value will come in the unique content
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.680]   and we're going to buy that from Netflix not from Comcast.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.120]   That's exactly what they're afraid of and they know it.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   They know this is happening.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.280]   They know it's inevitable now.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.480]   This is not a big surprise to them.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.160]   They're just trying to fight to the last rather than saying, "Hmm, this is where the world's
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   going.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.560]   Why don't we start our own damn Netflix and compete like crazy on the basis of quality?"
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.760]   I have to think this public policy blog is aimed at congressional staffers and if they
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.600]   understood it, members of Congress and it's essentially laying out the argument, "This
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.960]   is what we paid you to say.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   Here it is.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.560]   This is what you should be saying now."
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:36.000]   So don't only are we talking lawsuit, we're talking severe lobbying along these lines.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.560]   We'll see.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   Tom Wheeler.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.120]   I apologize.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.360]   You're not a dingo or a shill for the telecommunications and cable companies.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:52.160]   You are a free man and you did the right thing, I think so far.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.960]   I think in a very nuanced way that protects a little bit the people.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   We did a great debate on Twit a few, maybe a couple of months ago with two internet service
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.120]   providers on different sides of this.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:14.200]   I think that he's saying the things here that will reassure the ISP from Larry at Wyoming
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.320]   who was very concerned about getting a heavy-handed government regulations in his business while
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.960]   protecting the internet.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.720]   It seems like he's done a good job on this.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Let's hope so.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.480]   You wrote a good article on a computer world.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   Thank you.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.160]   The seven smartphone rules that changed this week, that kind of ties along.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.480]   This was before the FCC.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   It was.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   But the FCC lately has been, well, the month of January changed everything for a new pro
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   user.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:55.760]   So just quickly going through these, the carriers, if you recall, the FTC actually and the FCC
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   are both working together.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:02.280]   Basically, the FTC said that the track phone, they basically ordered the prepaid mobile
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:09.360]   provider track phone to pay a fine of $40 million because they throttled an unlimited
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   data plan.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   Wow.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.840]   So essentially that established the rule.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   These aren't laws.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.760]   These are just rules basically, but everybody has to adhere to these precedents where you
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.160]   can sell unlimited data plans and you can throttle data, but they can't be the same plan.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.480]   Yeah, the FTC was clear to say, this is not a rule against throttling.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.280]   This is a false advertising.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   Exactly.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   You can't say unlimited in an advertisement and then throttle.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   Exactly.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.120]   And actually that's, I think that's a little controversial because unlimited means as many
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.720]   bits as you want, throttling just means we're going to give them to you slower.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   Right.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.040]   But taken to an extreme, you can imagine, oh, give you one megabyte and after that it's
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   it's the speed of a 300 bod, bod motor.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.960]   Yeah, the engine is clear.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   It's clear.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   But here's Mike.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.400]   Is the hotels can't sell high speed when it ain't high speed?
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   Yes.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.160]   They should be held to account for what they sell.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   Right.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.960]   And this was the second change that they made, which was the FCC declared that true broadband,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.880]   they upgraded it used to be four megabits down, one megabit up.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.320]   Now it's 25 megabits down, three megabits up.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.400]   What does that change?
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.160]   This new definition of broadband.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.600]   It changes the idea that they're going to be selling a four megabit per second connection
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   is calling broadband.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   It's calling broadband.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.360]   Everybody uses broadband now to be synonymous with just internet connectivity.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.960]   We do it all the time and we journalists do it all the time, just call it a mobile broadband,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   for example.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.680]   Well, you know, there's a lot of data connectivity that's super, super, super slow and we're
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   calling broadband.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.800]   Broadband used to be a distinction to separate fast internet connectivity with slow internet
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.000]   connectivity.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And still, I mean, 25 megabits per second, I don't think for downloads, I don't think
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.440]   is that fast.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.280]   It's a pretty low hurdle.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.680]   Well, the standards have changed over the years.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.400]   Well, I would have been thrilled with a megabit and a half, 15 years ago.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.840]   One of the co-anchors on tech news today is Elise Hugh.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.440]   She's moving to Seoul, Korea and she's going to become the Seoul bureau chief for NPR.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.200]   And she was saying that they essentially define broadband as 100 megabits per second.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Right.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   And everybody's got it.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.720]   But isn't it the government providing it?
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.080]   Is it private industry or is it a government run?
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.800]   I think the government is squeezing the experience.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   It's subsidized, perhaps.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   Something like that.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   So that's the issue.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.560]   I mean, we hear a lot about Sweden and South Korea and other countries where they have
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.400]   very inexpensive, very high-speed internet.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.880]   But in almost every case, it's subsidized.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   And I don't see anything wrong with that.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.000]   No, I'm not a big like, you know, government should be, you know, taxing and spending.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.240]   But I saw a study, I think it was last year at some point, somebody calculated how much
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.040]   it would cost to give everybody in the United States Google fiber level speed.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   How much?
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   It's about a couple hundred billion bucks.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.320]   It's basically what we spent in Afghanistan in like two weeks.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   Yeah, Apple should.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.720]   Or something, you know, it's yeah, exactly.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.640]   So I think you have an unintended consequence because by redefining broadband, you suddenly
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:05.040]   make Comcast 56% of all the broadband market.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.440]   They have more than half of all U.S. broadband customers.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.440]   Oh, good point.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.440]   Yep.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   And that's actually ours.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.840]   Technica made that point, but a great point.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   And I don't know if that was an intended consequence or not.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.120]   But now Congress has to grapple or not the Congress, I guess.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.520]   Is it the FTC who has to rule on the Comcast time Warner, merger?
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.920]   Whoever's an antitrust, whoever's regulating that has to really now say, oh, well, you
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.480]   really do have a lion's share.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.840]   Well, you know, I think what's happening here is I in general, I think we're finally
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.400]   getting in the president we were waiting for.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.720]   And I think this is the WTF period of Obama's administration.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   What the hell I'm going out.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.240]   I might as well do something good.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   Right.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.800]   And I think that's what's happened with these regulations.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:53.200]   The FTL find the legacy segment of the administration happens every every every presidency in the
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.040]   last remaining years, couple of years of the president.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.840]   But it's especially stark with President Obama because he did so little in the first
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   six years.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.240]   And yet said he was going to do so much.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.240]   Exactly.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   You know what?
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   Okay.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   I don't want to get political here.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   Just a little bit.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   I think he deserves more credit for the healthcare.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   Yes.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   He does.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   I absolutely agree.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.920]   And I know it's so Obamacare and you know, and Fox News thinks it's a really bad thing.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.520]   But I have to say that that was a that was something I never thought.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.800]   I don't think anybody ever thought would become the law of the land.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.320]   And while it's not single-payer healthcare, which is clearly what needs to happen, it's
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.000]   a huge step in that direction.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.840]   And all millions of people who are not covered by any health insurance are now covered.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.400]   And he also deserves playing for the website.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   And the political.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.240]   But the in terms of technology in particular, I think there's been a lot of movement in
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.440]   Washington, both from Wheeler and from President Obama in the right direction.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.920]   Whether you're left or the right.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:55.200]   Personally, I hate it when these things get sort of owned by the, you know, the propagandists
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.360]   who want to divide everybody.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.240]   Can we credit the internet population and all the comments for this?
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.320]   Do we get credit for this?
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.520]   I think there's a lot of credit to be given to.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.880]   Because essentially, these are the people who are paying attention who have a lot of money.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   Silicon Valley has a lot of money.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.720]   And we set up and we said we want this.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.520]   And I think maybe Wheeler and Obama said, oh, and these people vote.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.520]   Okay.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.520]   And they give money.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   And they give money.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   Which they need to.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.320]   And they lobby.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.520]   Item three on your list, hotels.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   Marriott gave up.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   Yes.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.400]   Hotels cannot block your Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.360]   Marriott said, okay, all right, all right.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.160]   Again, credit the internet community.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.840]   Well, there's a fine print to that though, Mike.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.880]   Not that I'm, I mean, essentially the, um, Marriott actually implemented it only in one
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   hotel.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.560]   They were fine, $600,000 for that.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.240]   But, and this is not, um, this hasn't been formally, uh, established yet, but in separate
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.120]   speeches, FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworzel and Tom Wheeler, uh, both said in very clear
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.480]   terms that blocking should not be allowed.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.920]   They basically, uh, pointed out their intention to not allow it.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.360]   And what was really refreshing was that Rosenworzel actually said that we need a lot more unlicensed
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.480]   spectrum that can be used for things like personal Wi-Fi hotspots.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.000]   And so the FCC, though at least those two on the FCC, there's the, by, I think those
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.800]   are the two most influential, uh, chairpeople.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   They are very much in favor of no clamping down on, uh, personal use, like, you know,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.920]   Wi-Fi hotspot is essentially where you go and you plug into the hotels network and then
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.600]   you turn it into a Wi-Fi hotspot that five people can use in your room or one person can
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.440]   use with five devices, whatever it is.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.600]   Uh, and they're basically saying, we're all favored.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.480]   This, this should not be restricted in any point either by the amount of available, uh,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:55.680]   uh, airwave, you know, frequencies or by, by the policy of whatever hotel you're staying
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   in.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.560]   So it was really a really great, um, direction for the FCC to be going in because it was
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   unestablished.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   I mean, it was essentially something that was an open question.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.160]   Can companies who have, who provide internet connectivity as one of the benefits or services
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.520]   that they provide, will let you force you to pay for each device that is on that network.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.680]   And now the answer is no, they cannot, which is great.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.240]   So, um, item four, you don't have to die needlessly.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.600]   Thank you FCC.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   Yes.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.640]   Oh, wait a minute, because emergency personnel can't locate you indoors.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.920]   I didn't even know about this.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   No, I didn't either.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.600]   The FCC approved new rules that require carriers to within two years start using technology.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.200]   So they're essentially giving, uh, benchmarks for the carriers within two years, they have
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.040]   to be able to provide the location of a 911 caller within 50 meters in at least 40% of
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   cases.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.120]   Okay.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.160]   That means they're going to have, they're going to be, it's all going to be mushed together
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.640]   and they're going to have averages.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.600]   And if they, and that requires lots of indoor location technology.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.280]   And so they have to allow this in order to make sure that people can find, you know,
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.640]   emergency workers can find people who need help, which also means tell them if I'm wrong,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.440]   that that's where the Wi-Fi address sniffing stuff comes in handy, right?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.840]   Uh, I'm sure it does.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   And I'm sure that all the technology is going to do that.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.360]   All the, uh, all that has not been, been hammered out.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   There's obviously a million ways to do indoor location, but they're basically throwing it
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.040]   at the, um, carriers and saying you have two years to, to really make indoor location
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.600]   work for emergency person within 50 meters.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   In 40% of the cases.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   Yep.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.280]   You still have a 60% chance of dying needlessly, but hey, that's better than nothing.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.080]   Uh, no bad airplane.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.400]   We talked about this with Nick built in, you know, Nick, we can get Nick was on Twitter
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:55.520]   on Sunday and give Nick a lot of credit for skymall going bankrupt because he by rattling
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.800]   the cage and using his bully pulpit at the New York Times managed to convince, uh, the
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:06.760]   FAA to allow airlines to, you know, leave your device on during takeoff and landings.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.440]   And that's why skymall went bankrupt.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.120]   They said because nobody read the catalog anymore because they could just continue to
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.040]   stare at their iPad, their iPhone, their Kindle.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   Yep.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.240]   So Nick takes credit for putting skymall out of business.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:23.680]   Uh, now, uh, Nick's got a new campaign, slow overpriced wifi and airplanes.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.120]   And he said, I know, I know I've heard the Louis say, K bit, we should all be insanely
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   grateful.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:34.080]   We're flying seven miles high through the air at 600 miles an hour.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.920]   And gee, the wifi sucks.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.200]   But, but there is a technology.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   That's right.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:45.520]   The FCC recently approved a new service from go go called toku or to KU.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.160]   Uh, and that's going to be installed in a thousand aircraft.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.920]   Now most of airplane wifi, you're beaming it down to the earth to towers.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:01.160]   This beams it up to satellites and it's, it's, it's much, much faster up to 70 megapits per
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.600]   second, which is almost certainly faster than our homes.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.840]   Uh, it's really fast.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.000]   It's rolling us out right now, right?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Yes.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And the go go says that it'll be available to airlines in the second half of this year
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.600]   broadly.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.280]   And so this is, this is going to be fantastic.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.720]   There are going to be lots of airplanes in the sky where you log in and it's going to
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   be way faster than your house.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   You can watch this.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.960]   You know, I saw a video from, I think, United that showed the retrofit for a plane to put
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   in wifi.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.320]   I can't believe how hard it was that mouth.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.360]   They had to tear out the wifi in.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   I understand why they chug.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.360]   I said this to Nick.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.480]   I said, I understand why they charge so much.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.600]   The fuel surcharge alone, I mean, there are hundreds of pounds of new equipment they have
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   to put in.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.200]   Um, the must cost them some money to offer this wifi.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.880]   Um, but they can use it themselves as well.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.760]   I wish I could just use miles for it.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.680]   I would, I would buy it or freely with miles.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.160]   You know, I noticed that hotels are increasingly offering free wifi.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.520]   I wonder if that will happen in planes too.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.320]   It's a, if you were the first, if you, if JetBlue said, look, free internet on all our
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.120]   flights and it's this new 2KU.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.720]   I think that I would absolutely be more likely to buy a ticket on JetBlue.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.200]   Plus, look at the money you save on providing content.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.880]   You'd have to show movies and all that kind of stuff.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   Right.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   Of course, that's their, their marketing.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   That's already happening in the United.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   Yes.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   I'm the one United.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.040]   Uh, and I, I, I am global services on United.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.680]   I am the highest level.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   Wow.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   I'm that a hole who gets on the plane first.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   Yes.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   Yes.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   All of you be damned.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.040]   Do you have to sit in a stroller to do it or are you a less senior type?
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   I know.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   I know.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   Excuse me.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   I am.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.600]   You go, you go for babies.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.760]   He gets on the four babies.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.800]   I get on before the pilot.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.360]   It's my plane for two minutes.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:52.200]   Um, but, you know, I think that the, the, the, the Wi-Fi would be a great benefit for
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.560]   the very frequent flyers.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   I think it's a, it's a benefit that you can use and the, and the cash they get is limited.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.720]   And you're right, Mike.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.040]   You now can download the United app and then when you get on the plane, when it's equipped
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.840]   with Wi-Fi, that's how you can watch movies.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.720]   So enjoy not getting online on their plane.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.280]   Not, I just put on my headphones, listen to music and relax.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.320]   It's one of the few places I get disconnected.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   So I don't really care.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   Days are numbered.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   I guess so.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.160]   But now you can use the Wi-Fi to watch a movie without having to download it to your
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.240]   tablet because it's provided.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.680]   No, you know, I know it's 70 megabits.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   But remember that 70 megabits shared among all the passengers on the plane.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.560]   You're the one you Mr. Global Services is going to ruin it for all of us.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.760]   You'll be skyping, streaming, watching a movie.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.200]   There'll be no net neutrality for you.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.480]   Number six, the entertainment industry can't use emergency alerts and movie promotions
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   anymore.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   That's right.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.240]   The movie, a movie called Olympus has fallen.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.600]   They had a trailer or a commercial for this movie on, on Viacom, on ESPN and, and the FCC
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:08.360]   find, uh, Viacom and ESPN, $1.4 million because this movie trailer used the official emergency
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.560]   alert tone.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.200]   So the, with the action heroes and stuff running around on screen, the alert, the tone was
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.440]   going and this, and then they said, you can't use the tone.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   You can't do that.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   I'm a bad person.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.400]   I turn off amber alerts on my phone.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.720]   I don't want to know.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   I don't care.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   To depressing.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.400]   What are the odds that you're going to see?
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.720]   You know what happened?
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.520]   Can I tell you what happened here when we were flood, like last month when there was flood
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.200]   warnings, every phone in the place went off with a flood warning.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.200]   Like what?
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.240]   I mean, we just, what, every jump and run because the floods coming?
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   No, I turned it off.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.160]   They can't turn off presidential alerts.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.040]   But I figure if I'm getting a presidential alert, the end of the world is imminent, right?
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.400]   That's the flood warning happened.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.520]   We were doing TNT live and it was, you know, it's like we're pretty dry here.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520]   We're kind of on a hill.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.520]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.360]   I mean, I understand the need.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.080]   Tornado's coming.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.840]   Run for the seller.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   But I just turn it off.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.560]   I'm a bad, I'm the bad man who's not going to help find your lost child.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.920]   You have to dig to find that emergency.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.320]   I think is it cell broadcast?
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:24.880]   I actually think the fact that Facebook is, is, is putting amber alerts selectively on
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.880]   people's news feeds.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.880]   I think that's the right place to do it.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.520]   You're focused on the content.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   What's happening in my area?
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   I can't.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.600]   What am I going to get in the car and look for a beat up Dodge mini bus?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   I don't.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   I'm not going to.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.040]   So, so extreme threats.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   I have that still.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   You know what?
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   I don't want that either.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   Severe threats?
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040]   No.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   Amber alerts?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   No.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.600]   But you can't turn off the presidential alerts.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.440]   So but but definitely let me know when the cupcakes come out of the oven at the bakery.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.160]   Yeah, I want to know.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.880]   Donuts are ready.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.880]   I want a shark.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.880]   Such a bad.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   You don't have to jump through hoops to complain anymore.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   Item seven.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   Yeah, they have a new website.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   They have the kind of website that we need.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   It won't break down if they get more than a million comments.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   The fact is that the new website is okay, but their old website was horrible.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.440]   It was like from the 90s and it just, you know, it was 16 powered and stuff.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   It was horrible.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   It's much, much better.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:27.000]   And you can go and complain and whine about any company that is providing services that
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.640]   the FCC is involved with.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.200]   There should be a checkbox though for a zombie apocalypse.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   Yes.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   That I would like to know about ahead of time.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   Right.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.260]   Come back with more Jeff Jarvis, Mike Algin, Leo Laport, talking Google and the Google
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.840]   verse and that neutrality.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.800]   This is the one place really I find when I bookmark news, I bookmark a lot of stories
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.200]   for this show because this is the catch all.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.240]   You can talk about anything on this show.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.840]   Even if we didn't, Google itself is a massive generator of news stories.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.560]   It all has to have it with Google.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.040]   Actually, I did want to mention, and I'll probably mention this on Twitter as well, but
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.160]   Monty Ome, who worked at Rooster Teeth, who was an animator.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.200]   You've seen his work on Red vs Blue.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.360]   He was doing a new animated web series called Ruby.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.360]   Very tragic.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.360]   33 years old.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.160]   He passed away, fell into a coma, got an allergic reaction during a medical procedure and never
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   recovered.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.040]   He was at 33 years old, Monty Ome, and you may not know the name, but you almost certainly
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.880]   know his work in Red vs Blue.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:34.800]   Apparently, Rooster Teeth is going to continue Ruby, RWBY, and continue production of that.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   So I thought I'd make a mention of that.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.280]   You can't turn these alerts off.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   Sorry.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   But you know what else?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.680]   You can't turn off the snacks.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.840]   The snacks just keep a coming.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's nature.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.240]   Oh, new one.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.800]   Ah, nature box time.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   Oseaaga.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   Look at that.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   Oseaaga and cheddar cheese crisps.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   What is an Oseaaga?
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.960]   Oseaaga cheese is a fabulous hard cheese.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.280]   A little bit like Romano.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.640]   It has a sharp, it's delicious.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.600]   Italian Bistro pretzels, garlic and Parmesan cheese flavored pretzel bites, pistachio power
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   clothes.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   You know what?
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   There's one thing in common.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.000]   Sweet coffee kettle popcorn, savory.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.560]   Oseaaga with cheddar and cheese crisps.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   Ooh.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   Spicy.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   Coffee kettle popcorn.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   I know.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   Ooh.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.720]   But there's one thing all of these have in common.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:32.640]   Nutritionist approved never any high fructose corn syrup, never any saturated fats, only
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.360]   the good stuff.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.200]   And it's in resealable bags.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.000]   If you are going to the candy machine around this time every day, don't stop.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Stop the insanity.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.840]   Get nature box delivered to your door.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.600]   Deliciously wholesome snacks with great flavors.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.680]   And as I said, spicy, savory, sweet, but they also have snacks for various dietary needs.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.840]   There's gluten free snacks, vegan snacks.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.560]   You get to pick in every case, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors, no artificial
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.320]   sweeteners, no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.600]   So in the afternoon, when you're hungry, grab a chocolate banana chip or a kung bao pretzel
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.360]   or a lemon pucker pistachio.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.760]   If you go to naturebox.com/twit right now, you can get a complimentary trial box of five
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   of their most popular snacks.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.160]   You'll just pay $2 for the shipping.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   Delicious.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.960]   It'll give you a really good idea of what nature box has to offer.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.760]   And then I think subscribe.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.920]   You can even get more than a box a month.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.120]   We get like eight bucks a month now.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.480]   Get something because we've hooked the whole staff on them.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:42.240]   Naturebox.com/twit for your free sampler.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.760]   Get it today.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.760]   Google earnings.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.640]   I don't think I buried the lead.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.160]   I don't think this was such a big huge deal.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.200]   I mean, we talked about Apple earnings last week and that was a huge deal, largest profit
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.600]   in history of any company.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.640]   But people are saying Google did not have a great quarter.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.680]   They missed the analyst estimates.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   Yes.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.480]   They're doing well.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.720]   People expect a lot from them.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:16.560]   I think that they had a lot of the clarification of Google when Larry Page took over.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.240]   There was a big push.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.800]   They were kind of in the doldrums and then there was a big push of aggressive cutting,
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.960]   of dead wood, and then launching new products and so on.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.520]   And that seems to have fizzled out a little bit.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.720]   The problem with Google is that they seem, I think that investors are worried about,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.200]   is that they launch all these different, they're in everything.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   They're curing cancer.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   They've got self-driving cars.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.120]   They have blimps and balloons and all this kind of stuff.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.960]   And yet they're completely dependent upon advertising online.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.560]   And it's such a fickle market.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.160]   It's such a dangerous place to be.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.600]   Yes, Mike.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:57.240]   But I think YouTube and Play are now up to like, is it $8 billion, $4 billion each year?
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.320]   You know, still the percentage is shifting.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.800]   I think the bigger worry is that the price per ad is going down.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   Price per click too.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.720]   But not going as fast as it was, right?
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   It slowed a little bit.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   Yes.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   A little bit.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.920]   It's down 3% versus Facebook.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.840]   Pardon me for a second here.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   Is up 335%.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.680]   Now that was low, but the Facebook has momentum.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:28.360]   And as the Mo, on mobile, it has it on price per ad.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.160]   And that's really the issue that I think is worrying.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:37.200]   Google's still an incredibly large growing profitable company.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.160]   It's just I think a little bit of worry about the low.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.080]   And everybody's eating into their business.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.000]   I mean, they're losing market share in the United States slowly, but they're losing it
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.320]   to Yahoo and Bing and others, believe it or not, Yahoo's growing.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.520]   And it seems like no matter what Google does, other companies are aggressively getting into
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   it.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.280]   And we thought nobody else would get into that.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.920]   I mean, we just we just had a story on tech news today this morning that it looks like
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.720]   Apple might be having might have street view cars and it might even be launching a product
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.840]   called Apple Search.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.960]   I think that neither of those things are 100%.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.200]   There may be 50/50 at this point.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.320]   But if you go through each of Google's traditional businesses, what they do, whether it's search,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.960]   whether it's email, whether it's any of the things that they do, there's a lot.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.640]   There are a lot of powerful companies getting into that business and potentially chewing
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.880]   away at their market share.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.200]   Not going to replace them as the leader in some of those areas, but just gnawing away
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.720]   and eroding their dominance.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.880]   And I think that's one of the things that some are worried about.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.600]   I mean, of course, these are good problems to have that we're talking billions of dollars.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.360]   But again, I think that the investors are right to be nervous about the heavy reliance
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   on advertising.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.920]   They're still 80-something-plus percentage of their revenues from advertising.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.960]   And it's like that can just dry up and change overnight.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.480]   I think one of the biggest success stories and biggest areas of potential is YouTube,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.320]   of course, because everybody's trying to get into, this is what Facebook is trying
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:15.000]   to do with all the video, what Twitter and others are trying to do with video.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.600]   They're all trying to compete with the attention grabbing power of YouTube, right?
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.120]   Because it's just so many hours spent with eyeballs on that.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.800]   And you know, it's, yeah, they're going to continue to be a super successful company.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:35.600]   And they could be on the brink of diversifying their sources of revenue and profit.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.800]   But so far, I don't think they're diversifying it fast enough.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.200]   Well, by the way, I don't think that's a street view car.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.480]   I think it's a self-driving car.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.360]   You really think Apple would be in the self-driving car?
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.400]   I don't know why they would, but I just feel like it is.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.400]   Look at the stuff.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.400]   Yeah, it does.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   You're right.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.640]   And you can't tell the way it accelerated the minute that car pulled away, it keeps exactly
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   the same stop distance.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.440]   I think it's a self-driving car.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440]   It doesn't look like a street view.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.440]   I'll tell you that.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:05.400]   I would trust Apple and Google to make a self-driving car a lot more than I would trust
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   Uber.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.080]   Yeah, and Uber is apparently in that business too.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.000]   I don't know why Apple would either do street view or they have Apple Maps.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   And they don't like Google.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   They don't like to depend on Google.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.400]   I don't think I really can't see Apple getting into the...
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.360]   If they were doing a street view, you'd see a lot more of these.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.360]   Well, I think...
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.600]   Only seen two in the wild.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   I think...
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.120]   We talked about this with Katie Bennett this morning on Tech News today.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.440]   I think that there's a strong possibility that they're dipping their toe in the water.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   They've got billions to throw around.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.880]   Why not just check it out and see what it's like, see how this might improve maps.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.920]   If it works in San Francisco, maybe we'll throw a billion dollars at it and go nationwide.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.640]   But the difference, Mike, I think is that Google's in a better position to monetize
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.160]   local because it has the advertising structure for a huge mass.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   Salesforce.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   Google's really not there.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.720]   Google has 64 billion dollars in cash, good position for acquisition.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.000]   Their tax rate significantly lower than Apple.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.200]   The effective tax rate was 16 percent.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.440]   Apple was somewhere around 26 or 27 percent, I think.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.720]   Yeah, but all those Irish sandwiches and all that stuff.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   That's all going good with that.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   Yes.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:12.720]   It's going to go away.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.720]   In fact, we talked on Twitter about...
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   Was it a Twitter?
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.680]   No, yesterday on Macbreak Weekly about the fact that there are two emotions afoot to
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.080]   tax these overseas earnings.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.440]   President Obama has suggested a 14 percent tax.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:31.840]   And then Nancy Pelosi has suggested, along with Rand Paul of all people, has suggested
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:38.320]   a lower, I can't remember what it was, 4 percent tax, but a one time only tax would allow repatriation
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.320]   at no cost to the family.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.120]   Which is not going to make the Europeans happy.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   Right.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   Well, and that's all...
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   And that's all...
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.360]   Because what they'll do is they'll just declare all the revenue to be American revenue.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   Right.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   Right.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   And then the other guy, who's a little foreigner on the show, Renee Rich, who's from Canada.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:58.720]   And he said, "You know, that's a bad precedent for a country taxing income from another country."
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.200]   And so I think that probably this is a non-starter.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.480]   This is going to be a fight.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.480]   Anyway, so there's...
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.120]   So let me just say this about Google.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   Yes.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.600]   In full disclosure, I own Google stock.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.960]   I ain't selling it.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   It's doing...
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.480]   It's going to do amazingly for a long time to come.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.760]   I still believe.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.920]   I think you're right.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   Would you buy Facebook stock?
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.160]   Well, I wish I bought it long ago.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.160]   Right.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   I think...
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:33.400]   You know, the thing is about Facebook, that as a user, I'm not as engaged as I wish I were
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.600]   to fully understand where Facebook is and it's going.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   That's my issue there.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:48.360]   I mean, I'm engaged in Google+, Mike and I are the two wackos in the world who are.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.680]   With Facebook, I delve in all the time.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:57.840]   I just am not as into it as I think I should be to understand where their business is
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   going.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.240]   But you know, google facebook.com is not where their business is going.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.680]   Their business is going in a million different apps and they're really aggressive and they're
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.200]   being successful.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.920]   And I would definitely buy Facebook stock.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:21.240]   And I think they just...they're monopoly on everybody is growing to the point of no return.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   They...
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   Yes.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.800]   Nobody cares how bad Facebook is.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.160]   That's where everybody is.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.960]   And so you got to be there and it's just...
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.080]   What about the argument we hear though, Mike, all the time?
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.840]   Oh, but my kids aren't on Facebook.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.080]   Now they're on WhatsApp and they're on Instagram.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.080]   Is that the answer?
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   Yeah, they're not.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.120]   They're also not using email, but they will.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   They'll come around.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.200]   They are using Snapchat.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.080]   I know it for a fact because Nick built and told me so.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.880]   And if you haven't seen Nick built and snapchat instruction to me on Twitter on Sunday, you
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.880]   got to watch it.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.880]   But you know, you really know what the kids...
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   I'm a believer.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.880]   The kids use Snapchat.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.800]   You'll know that kids are using Snapchat when Facebook buys Snapchat.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.920]   I mean, Facebook tried to buy Snapchat.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.920]   They did.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:04.920]   They did.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.840]   But you know, it's like, you know, maybe they'll throw $20 billion out or something like that.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   That's going to be fun.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.080]   What I'm saying is that Facebook is...
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.280]   Whenever they see a category that is threatening there, you know, where people are going, they'll
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.080]   go and snap it up before people can go there.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   Essentially.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.080]   Look at WhatsApp.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.320]   You can see, the kids aren't as dumb as they look.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.720]   And they're also very fickle.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.760]   So they're both smart and fickle.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.960]   And I talked to my son, Henry, who's 20.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.080]   You have a young son, two young sons.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   So you kind of know too.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.080]   But I asked...
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:38.200]   I had Henry over the Christmas break and about six of his friends, all the same.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.200]   All college students.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.240]   I said, "You use Facebook and how that's what our parents use.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.960]   Do you use Twitter?"
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.520]   We use it to message each other for fun.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   It's a hoot.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.760]   They don't use it the same way we do.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   Use WhatsApp?
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   No.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.520]   One guy used it with his French girlfriend.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   What do you use?
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.520]   Snapchat?
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.520]   All the time.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   A little bit of Instagram.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.640]   But mostly Snapchat all the time.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.480]   But Snapchat is the social network for fickle people, as you said.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   Once they have kids and the kids, Facebook...
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.920]   Maybe they'll come to Facebook, Bill.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.720]   Facebook is the inevitable.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.280]   That's where the gravitational center of the black hole is.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.640]   I mean, it's like, people get sucked into it one way or the other.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.960]   Eventually, most people do.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   Not everybody.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.120]   And so, yeah.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.280]   When you're like, Henry, you're in college, you got a bunch of young friends, probably
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.440]   half his friends he met within the last two years.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.440]   There are no baby pictures.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440]   You're right.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   You're right.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   And it's like, that's a place where you can come and go.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.680]   Next year, there'll be something else.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   I guarantee it.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.320]   Next year, there'll be another platform that they will have left Snapchat for.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.800]   They're fickle, so you can't really put it.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   Wow.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.040]   Do me a favor and just go to snapchat.com right now.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.720]   I don't think there is a web in your face.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   There is.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.720]   There is.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.120]   And what's striking about it is the big media brands that are there.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   This just happened.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.120]   Have you seen...?
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.120]   Yeah, this is phenomenal.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.960]   Have you seen Katie Kirk and what she's doing on Snapchat?
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   A little bit.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   I think it's very intriguing.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   It's interesting.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   They're going to use on Snapchat.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.040]   So they just added on Snapchat a...
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   I've been logged out.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.200]   I got to log in.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.600]   Well, so what she does is you only get...
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   What how long is it?
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.560]   10 seconds per snap.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.720]   And they die, by the way, after 24 hours, even if nobody looks at them.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.280]   She's doing one story, very nicely produced.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:31.320]   In fact, there must be a tool, like a desktop tool for these brands.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.600]   Because there are people doing content on Snapchat.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.360]   That's what you're seeing here.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.200]   So, okay, let me go back into Snapchat.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.400]   Yeah, there's YouTube stars.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   Yeah, here's...
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.600]   You press the Discover button.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.080]   These are all the different brands.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.880]   CNN, Comedy Central, Cosmopolitan.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   But here's Yahoo!
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.880]   Watch...
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.280]   I don't know if you'll be able to hear this, but watch what Katie Kirk's doing.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   It's really...
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.040]   Or I guess Yahoo's doing, we should probably say.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.560]   "The Trans-Asia flight carrying 58 hits a highway bridge before crashing into a river in Taiwan.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.720]   23 are dead, 20 missing, but there are survivors."
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.080]   Yeah, it's going to repeat.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.000]   But then, if I want, I swipe to the next one.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.080]   "The suburbs of New York City strikes a car on the track."
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   She is.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   "I'm a car force to flee.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.080]   A commuter train in the south of the south of the south of the south of the south."
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   So that repeat, and then I swipe again.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.080]   Another story.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.400]   Now, I don't know what value, I don't know if they can monetize this.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.400]   I don't...
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   It's obviously, I think...
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   I'm not branding.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   I mean, Katie...
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.000]   I asked Nick on this because Nick has just wrote a New York Times piece, singing Snapchat
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   sprays.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.360]   I said, "Are these brands wasting their money?"
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.360]   He said, "Absolutely."
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.200]   This is great for Snapchat, but I got to tell you...
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   Not for Katie Kirk.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.640]   Here's why.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.840]   Because I think that Marissa Meyer hiring her expected it would draw audience to it, but
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   they've got...
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840]   People actually know she's there.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840]   Right.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.560]   And once she's there, I think that's branding is important.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:58.600]   Do you really think that anybody uses Snapchat goes, "Oh, there's Katie Kirk.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.920]   She's on Yahoo News now."
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   Well, here's...
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.960]   Well, let me do a other full disclosure.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.760]   Katie is in fact an indeed, extremely nice person, and I imposed like crazy on her for
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.680]   her to speak to my daughter's school about women in media, and she agreed to do it.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.720]   So I love Katie right now.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.720]   I do too.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.720]   Katie's absolutely sweet as...
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.880]   She's as nice as she seems.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.560]   Did you ever find out what internet was, though?
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   That was the greatest.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   That was part of her.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.040]   She's willing to make fun of herself.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   And I think she's trying very hard to be innovative.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.440]   And so I think there's an audience of people who really young people didn't watch Katie
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.440]   Kirk on the Today Show.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.240]   They didn't watch her on CBS.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.440]   So she's somebody new, Yahoo News, who knows.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.920]   I think it's worth the shot.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.880]   I was telling Mike, I think we should do TNT this way.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:52.040]   We should take the top five stories in TNT and make little screenshots out of them.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.120]   Yeah, they'll take us five minutes.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.600]   So that part of this is interesting.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:02.960]   The big brand, the big names, all that kind of stuff, ESPN, people, Vice and so on, that's
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.720]   the part that's going to fail, I think, on Snapchat.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.440]   There's another thing that I think is really interesting, which is that...
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:12.040]   I can see my son watching this because this is just highlight clips.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.360]   And this is about his attention span, six seconds.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   And so...
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.280]   Actually, this seems to me...
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.120]   The ESPN thing makes sense to me.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.560]   It does make sense.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.440]   The big problem is that people approach Snapchat with a mindset about what they want to do
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   with it.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.640]   And it's communications medium.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:38.000]   And so they have an uphill battle convincing people to embrace that as a passive content
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.640]   reception medium.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:46.400]   But Snapchat is also launching something called Snapper Hero, which are YouTube celebrities
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.560]   like Shonduras McBride and Freddie Wong and others.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.320]   And what's interesting about that is that these episodes will run for about two minutes.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.720]   And what they're doing is they're trying to...
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.960]   When you see these YouTube celebrities, they're almost like one of your friends sending you
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   a goofy video.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.160]   So they're trying to train users to use video a lot more because video is the most powerful
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   medium.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.920]   It's the most eye-grabbing medium eyeball catching and attention-grabbing medium there is.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.000]   And so everybody's trying to get people to use video.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.200]   And they're using these YouTube stars to get people to sort of train them into this behavior
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.200]   of sharing videos.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.200]   Wow.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   This is just...
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.400]   Which is different from Katie Kirk.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.560]   People are not going to launch news programs when they see...
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.560]   Right.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   Right.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.920]   What was Nick's argument about the wonder of Snapchat and why Snapchat's...
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   I'll watch it.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:40.160]   He's using Snapchat stories, which I find interesting, which is really kind of the individual's
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.120]   way of doing this, which is doing short little stories that are all linked together.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.000]   So if I could actually do one, if I could figure...
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.160]   The other thing that's weird about Snapchat is the user interface is ZAR.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   I don't even...
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   I don't know.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.560]   I don't know how to get out of anything.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   All right.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.800]   Here we go.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.160]   So I can record something.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.400]   We'll do something real quickly here.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.160]   Look at the camera around.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.160]   It's another Snapchat story from Twitter.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.520]   And then I can add text or whatever.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   And then you add it to this.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.920]   And now it's part of a story which anybody can watch.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.040]   You can have lots of pieces in your story.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:28.000]   Just very much like the Katie Koryk thing or the ESPN thing.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.920]   People can subscribe to you.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.680]   It's not messages from friends.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.080]   So Baratunde is doing that.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.040]   Actually, I wish I could show you "builtons" yesterday, but it's gone.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:43.600]   The other thing that's weird is that it goes away, right?
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.000]   So this is Snapchatunde.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.400]   He's using a lot of text.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   I don't know.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.520]   There's something interesting about this.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:58.720]   Nook really feels like this is a communications medium for a new generation and that they...
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.800]   the kids.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   It's the kids.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:05.480]   And of course, as you know, from being in media, Jeff, for years, everybody wants the
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   kids.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   Nope.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.200]   How can we get the kids?
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.280]   What are the kids doing?
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.800]   Why would anybody want the kids?
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:12.960]   I don't know.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.320]   Screw the kids.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.960]   That's why I turned off Amber Alerts.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.120]   I've decided my new persona is going to be grumpy.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.520]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.520]   We've got a good panel.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.520]   I'll tell you.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.000]   It's always great with Jeff Jarvis, Mike Elgin.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.520]   Talking to the Google.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.440]   Talking about stuff.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.920]   First, let's talk a little bit about LegalZoom.com.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:44.680]   If you're starting a business, if you've got a family, legal costs can really eat you
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.680]   alive.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.160]   In fact, probably it's enough that it's kept you from getting that will or the health
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:56.280]   care power of attorney or a financial power of attorney.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.880]   Maybe you've got a business, but you haven't created a limited liability company or an
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.840]   S-Corp or a C-Corp yet.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.240]   LegalZoom makes it easy.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.520]   They're not a law firm.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.920]   They actually are self-help services at your specific direction.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.320]   You go to LegalZoom.com and you start getting your life organized.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:17.200]   A great place to start protecting your family, take control of your family's future, make
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.120]   a will or a living trust.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.240]   LegalZoom makes it easy.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:25.400]   There's no more affordable or easier way to make your family to make sure your family's
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.200]   legally taken care of.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   You can also get your business in shape, trademarks, patents, incorporation.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   All very affordable.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:39.640]   Now, from time to time, you might want an attorney to ask a few questions.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.960]   If you like more help, LegalZoom can connect you with an independent attorney in many
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:43.960]   states.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:50.320]   LegalZoom is not a law firm, but these pre-negotiated fixed rate prices are very affordable to get
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.440]   answers from an attorney as well.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.680]   I think LegalZoom's got it all.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.680]   Everything you need.
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.320]   I want you to visit LegalZoom.com.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.120]   Get your family or your business protected.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:04.280]   Do the things you need to do, much less expensive than you'd ever imagine.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.480]   And when you use the offer code TWIG, you get $10 off that checkout.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.040]   LegalZoom.com, don't forget to use the offer code TWIG.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:18.920]   Did I say TWIG when you check out?
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.160]   I'll save you $10.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.240]   It's a really great idea.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.040]   Project Tango.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.480]   What is Project Tango?
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.720]   That's the phone thing, isn't it?
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   Is this the era?
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   3D mapping.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   Oh, it's 3D mapping.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.720]   Oh, that's the 3D mapping.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.720]   That's right.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:41.560]   It's a physical hardware prototype device that has powerful, powerful chips in it that
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:47.000]   essentially can instant, very quickly, 3D map indoor spaces, which can be used for
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.960]   a million things, like for gaming, for augmenting.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   Maybe E9-1-1.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.560]   So spinning it out means it's still part of Google, but it's just no longer going to
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.400]   be in the advanced technology group.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.720]   It's going to be a little bit more real, I guess.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.040]   When this happened to Google Glass, everybody said Google Glass was dead.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.080]   When they said, "It's a real product now," or we said, "See, it's dead."
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.160]   No, it's a real product now.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.160]   They're going to have access?
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.160]   They're going to sell it?
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.240]   Well, this is a device that is something of a reference platform.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   So they're going to basically--
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]   Could you put it on a smartphone?
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.040]   It looks like it's something it is.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.480]   It's a modified phone that has graphics chips in it that until a year ago or two years ago
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.760]   only existed in very powerful computers.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:40.800]   So it's high-end, kind of expensive, but you can imagine unbelievable.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.040]   When Microsoft rolled out the HoloLens, everybody said, "Wow, this is the future.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.040]   This is amazing.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   Yes, that is the future.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.720]   That experience is going to be a massive platform."
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.480]   Just like you said, Leo, on several shows, that this is a whole new platform.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.560]   But I'm not so sure that Microsoft is going to own it.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.560]   This is going to be enabling that sort of device.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.520]   You'll be able to plug in a headset into this thing and walk around with this thing.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   I just think that the opportunity for sight-impaired people is unbelievable.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.520]   So you use this not only to map, but once mapped, you can use it to navigate around.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.520]   Yes.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520]   You can talk around in here.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   Take me to the bathroom.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.520]   Wow.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.520]   Just right there.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.520]   Right.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.520]   The power of that.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.480]   And then put in things like Internet of Things.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.720]   So it would give you, it would say, "Okay, walk three steps and turn left."
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   That kind of thing.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   No, no.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   Why would that be haptic?
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.400]   It will not only know where the hall is, where the door is, it'll know that there's
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.200]   a toy truck right in front of you.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   Right.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.200]   Don't step on that.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.200]   Wow.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   Walk around the dog.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   The dog is walking right.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.200]   I mean, it's real time.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.680]   So seeing as well as something that's already recorded.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.680]   Wow.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.120]   And it's constantly mapping and recording and seeing all at the same time.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:53.200]   It's not instant instant, but it's relatively high fidelity.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.720]   And it's in a mobile phone.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.080]   So you think this will be involved with the Leap Motion technologies that Google also
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.480]   is invested in or is that a separate kind of thing?
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.920]   I'm pretty sure that that's a separate kind of thing.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.360]   I'm actually, this is all the stuff that you've actually said.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.800]   Get out of this stuff.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800]   Stick it to your knitting.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   They were wrong about that.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   You're spending money on this.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   What are you nuts?
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.480]   I actually think that I have a feeling that the Leap Motion is probably a little bit ahead
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.800]   of Microsoft's HoloLens.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.440]   And I don't think this is related to Leap Motion.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:28.360]   This is all about making sort of indoor mapping like highly mobile.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.640]   And I don't think your Galaxy S7 is going to have this technology in it.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.600]   I don't think this is going to be a consumer-
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.760]   Yeah, it looks like it's a dedicated thing.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.920]   Yeah, it'll be a higher-end device.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.760]   But maybe it will be in something like a Galaxy S7.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:47.440]   They've got to find ways to put stuff to make to distinguish the next generation of
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440]   phones.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.200]   We've already kind of hit the wall and what new stuff you can do.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.080]   So there's still project era.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:02.160]   But Project Tango exits the advanced technology and projects group to become perhaps a real
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.160]   approach.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.080]   Well, what's interesting too is not now imagine Street View.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   Right.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.400]   You're inside, fully mapping the inside world.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:24.040]   And a mall that then you start to map to merchandise.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:30.080]   As long as we're talking to Blue Sky, this is another project out of Google's X projects.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.400]   Google is making human skin.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   Yes.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   So that.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.680]   So that they can cure cancer.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.680]   They have a cancer.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.520]   They're working on a type of- Detect cancer.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.440]   Detect cancer, yes, I'm sorry.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.800]   Which, wait a minute.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:50.000]   So they've been making synthetic human skin to create a wristband that can detect cancer
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.440]   or heart attacks or other diseases.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440]   Right.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.600]   This is a little creepy.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.880]   This video from the Atlantic shows two disembodied arms.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.760]   It's the beginning of Google making human beings.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   That's what it's about.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   Wow.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.760]   Wow.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.960]   They use nanoparticles.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280]   They use net.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:18.320]   These synthetic skin strips are using nanoparticles to search in my body for disease?
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   No.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   Oh.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.120]   The skin strips- That's what it says here.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:28.680]   The skin strips are being used to test this technology that uses nanoparticles to detect
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680]   cancer.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.120]   Well, they don't have the nanoparticles yet.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   Right.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.680]   But they want to be ready with the skin strips.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.760]   They want to- So the condensed version is that they're working on technology that will
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.600]   enable a bracelet to detect cancer using magnetic nanoparticles.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.320]   But you would swallow the pill containing the nanoparticles.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:54.840]   So the arm and the skin are- They have the same light absorbing properties as human skin.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.320]   And other qualities of human skin so they can test it without doing something weird to
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.400]   some real human wrists.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.480]   So the artificial skin, the artificial arm part of it is a test dummy for their technology
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.640]   that would detect cancer with a bracelet.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   It's a search engine company.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   Of course they're doing this.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.200]   Of course they're doing it.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.040]   Google is going to replace you not with a robot but with an artificial human.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040]   That's it.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.040]   Let's just be honest.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.040]   Advertisers support it.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.880]   That's when we feared and it's happening.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.160]   I'm kind of thrilled that- Is this as Larry or is it-
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   Sergey.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   Sergey.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.320]   I'm kind of thrilled that Sergey has decided I got more money than God.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   What should I do with it?
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.760]   I'm going to, you know, blue sky stuff, support blue sky stuff.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:43.800]   And better yet instead of just leaving Google and you know having a secret lab and a mountain
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.880]   volcano somewhere, I'm going to do it inside Google.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.040]   I think it's more than that.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.360]   You know, I think it's Bell Labs.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.000]   I think it's the role that AT&T had once in this country where we're going to do things
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.200]   about space and we're going to net the transistor and-
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.600]   Was Bell Labs stuff as goofy as this?
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.880]   There was not quite as goofy but there was pure research.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   There was absolutely pure research.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.280]   Some Unix came out of it.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.280]   C came out of it.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.240]   Much of what we use is modern computing came out of Bell Labs.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.080]   As you said, the transistor.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:18.800]   But I think that what Bell Labs did was all about computing and electricity and that sort
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   of thing.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.760]   What this is all about is I think that Sergey and in particular and Google in general tend
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.960]   to see Google as the experts in using massive data sets to create things to solve problems
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.480]   in a way that used to require a lot more money, a lot more people and a lot more time.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.000]   And so, you know, I think that they see this as identical to the search engine business
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.320]   because you're basically doing lots of data crunching and figuring out all these things.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:52.520]   Like, remember, Sergey's wife, they're still married, runs 23andMe.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:58.560]   And I'm sure that they have had many conversations about how you could use big data number crunching
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.160]   to figure out all kinds of correlations about health.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.360]   Oh, people who are left handed and also live in Utah, you know, never get cancer, whatever.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.120]   I mean, whatever the, you know, these unexpected and they're right about that.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.440]   He's right about that.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.560]   You can make some, you could do so much good in the world.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.560]   Right.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.280]   And by the way, there's probably some profit in all of this too.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   I mean, I'm sure there is.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.080]   I think one of the things Google does recognize, we've talked about this before, that the search
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.200]   thing isn't going to last forever and you've got to have the next thing.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.000]   And I'm sure that's what Bell Labs is up to.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.120]   So here's an interesting thing.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.080]   You can be your own technical director.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.680]   Jason Howell has always dreamt someday of being able to watch video and switch the angles.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.200]   This is a YouTube performer named Madeline Bailey.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.000]   She's the first to have switchable angles.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.280]   So right now we're on this angle, but let's say you'd like to see a side view.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   Wow.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.400]   Does it have the same, now this is the same video.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.360]   Talking about the YouTube musical.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.760]   And now he's talking, so let's go look at him.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.440]   But do you wonder what she's thinking while Arnold is talking?
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:05.440]   Or let's get all of the, it's too bad it's just wasted on such horrible programming.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.880]   Yeah, well, imagine the thing in the fanny pack back there.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.760]   And it's just three cameras.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.600]   Imagine the 30 cameras you have.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.400]   I would love to be able to do this.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.200]   What do we have to do to get into this project?
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.920]   We actually have content.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.160]   We almost already have this with the drop cams.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   We do.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.160]   We have six drop cams.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.320]   You can just switch from, but not as, I like how fast this is.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.120]   This is like, you know, I've always thought this would be kind of interesting.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.400]   We actually have dreamt of doing this for a long time at Twitch since almost day one,
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.160]   we're 10 years old, but I realized I had to have a separate stream for each camera.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.080]   And I was thinking of a user interface where you could do that, where you could cut back
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.080]   and forth.
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.680]   Then you got to have a website.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.160]   Yeah, but I can't afford a website.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.760]   So, oh, you had to bring that up.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   Oh, please.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.760]   Sorry.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   Switchable angles says computer vision or computer vision or chatroom.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   Switchable angles was a part of the DVD standard 20 years ago.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.960]   Just nobody did it.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   Huh?
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.960]   I remember that.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.160]   I don't remember that.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.160]   Dimly.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.760]   Wait before the DVD was the one was the big, the big desk.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   Laser disc.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.160]   Blue ray also has angles.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.880]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.480]   I feel like no, most people just want to watch the like, this is your job.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.480]   Whatever happened.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.680]   I mean, I do experience.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.080]   Yeah, it's my job.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.400]   I do it as a job.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.760]   When I met home about to put on a concert, I suppose it's neat to be able to do something
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.040]   like this, but am I really going to sit on my couch or have my computer and watch an
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.480]   hour long video and switch camera like you don't want to replace your your remote control
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   with a tricaster.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.240]   I think well, but imagine how you could create programming that would be made for this.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   Totally, totally.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.440]   Well, I think porn could benefit from this.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.240]   This is interesting.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   There it is.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.240]   All right.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   There you've seen it.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   It's an experiment.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.520]   Madeleine Bailey is doing it on her YouTube channel.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.440]   YouTube music night performance there.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:11.240]   And that's how you switch around.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   It's cool.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.680]   I mean, it's not a hard thing to do.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.680]   I think Alex Lindsey did something like this as well.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.680]   Um, what is smart lock?
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   Should we do this story?
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   What is smart?
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.680]   Oh, it's driving me nutty.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.240]   What is smart lock?
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.200]   Smart lock is so that you don't have to unlock your computer when your phone's nearby if you
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.480]   have Android five and if you have Chrome.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.080]   Oh, I like it.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.080]   Okay.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.480]   So you think you would think you would think that I have all people will be able to do
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.480]   that.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   Yes, Mr. Pixel.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.800]   No, no, no, no, because guess what?
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800]   What?
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:51.000]   Can't get screwed again and you got to march through all kinds of hoops and, and light them
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   on fire.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.440]   And I still haven't been able to make it work.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.000]   I Google fan boy have not been able to make this friggin work.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.460]   And while I'm at this, something else has changed so that now, even though I'm signed
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.200]   into my apps account, every window is my apps account.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   It's all apps accounts.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.080]   When I open a new Google app, it defaults to my Google plus Gmail account.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:17.120]   So I try to, I try to open something in docs, it opens it up in the wrong damn account,
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.480]   because Google can't figure this out.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:28.920]   Yeah, but that's in other words, this is actually a really cool feature that, that gets
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.600]   screwed up when you have multiple accounts, because as you said, Google can't figure that
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   out.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.200]   It gets concurrently screwed up and I still haven't been able to, to get this going and
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.480]   because there's, there's complicated, you have to go in into the ad apps admin account.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.960]   There's the Chrome thing which is hidden in other apps, then you have to go in there and
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.960]   find the place where you say, okay, okay, you can use this new feature.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960]   And then you need to restart and then you need to find it.
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   I still can't find it.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.960]   I don't know.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.360]   I understand how this is like super different from the, the feature that, you know, the member,
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.880]   the, I think they first introduced it on the Moto X where you had the Bluetooth thing.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.480]   And then you also even had a little magnetic.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480]   Yeah, the skip.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480]   And, but you could also do with your phone or whatever.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   They do that now.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   In fact, uh, snow, big deal.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480]   On the Moto X.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.280]   If you're, you know, it's a trusted Bluetooth network.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   It just unlocks it.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.080]   And, and of course this concept is going to be huge in the, in the Internet of Things
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.160]   and Home Automation because this will unlock everything, turn on lights, turn that, it'll
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.760]   be like Bill Gates's house.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.920]   We were going to wear, I think you were going to wear your electronic identity.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920]   Yes.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   And it should be your smartphone.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.320]   Uh, no, I don't think it's just smartphone.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   I think your smartphone is just another accessory.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.920]   Did you ever get into Bill Gates's house?
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   No, never did.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.120]   I always tried to, but, uh, the guards catch me.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   Security, yeah.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.600]   Um, cause I remember when he built it and this was 10, 15 years ago, the idea was you
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.240]   would walk in a room, he would already know what paintings you liked, what pictures you
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.400]   would be issued a pin of some kind of device that you would clip on.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.840]   And the paintings would change on the TV screens in the room to match your, your, your needs.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.840]   Right.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.880]   I'm afraid that I'd walk in and it'd be some Thomas concave or a crap.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.920]   If I have no taste.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.280]   Pain to have liked.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.960]   Um, I think that's kind of, I wonder, do you think like it's been a rat is, it was, they
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.280]   put it in 15 years ago, like it's kind of dusty and faded and it doesn't work anymore.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.760]   It's not like a world in the corner.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.480]   It'll be like tomorrow land at Disneyland.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   Welcome.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480]   Welcome.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480]   Welcome.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.040]   You know, like, what do you think?
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.480]   Do you think I would like to get into Bill Gates house now?
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.200]   See how much of that crap they've just turned off.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.760]   It's like, yeah, that was not a good idea.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760]   Right.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.320]   I'm sure that's true.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.680]   It's not, it's, it's, it's actually not so much the guards.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.200]   It's the wall and the dogs.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.000]   But if I'm, I'm working on it.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.840]   I shouldn't say that because then they're going to come to the Microsoft police.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.320]   No, it's Apple.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   It has a police.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   I think Microsoft probably has a police.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Just, just get with the program.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   Use a drone like everybody else.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.880]   One of Bill's books had a virtual tour of his house says Fred Flintstone, who has a mighty
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.480]   nice house himself, I might add.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.200]   He has to do everything with his free feet.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:11.600]   Google's secret weapon in the battle for the Internet of Things, speaking of IOT, academia.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:19.680]   According to this article in the Fast Company, Tina Amirtha, Google's not a adverse to using
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.320]   university brain power for a lot of what it's doing.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.880]   Maggie Johnson, Google's research, Google Research's Director of Education and University
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   Relations.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:37.800]   They have a grant program called Open Web of Things to Attract Talent to the Company.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:42.640]   You know, they, they, they've already hired a huge number of academics.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.080]   They're kind of, it's almost borderline brain drain.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   Situation and.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.640]   Well, they've always had more PhDs than any company in America, right?
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640]   Yes.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.680]   Well, you know, there's, there's an interesting precedent set to just today that I'm forgetting
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:02.520]   his name, a former guardian journalist who does visualization at Twitter is now also,
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.520]   in addition to that, and a contributing editor at Vox.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.720]   He's going to keep his Twitter job, but also make a contributor at Vox, which is interesting
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.680]   because I wonder what other media companies will think about that.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.840]   Well, you know, you're working for Vox.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.240]   Are you going to give us a nice stop or not?
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   Yeah, really.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.840]   Google's giving, we mentioned that Intel is spending, how much was it?
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.840]   $300 million to encourage diversity and technology.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.080]   Google, not to be left behind.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   It said, well, we'll give $775,000.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080]   A million.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.880]   No, $1000 million.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.880]   Yeah, $1000.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.880]   Yep.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.200]   I was all, they're giving an a grants to code 2040.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.600]   Google, Intel gave $300 million.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600]   Yep.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.160]   Oh.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.320]   And that, I believe, is for gender diversity.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.840]   This is for diversity to get more minorities into technology.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.960]   I think Intel does it all.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   But yeah.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:01.960]   Do they?
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Okay.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   Well, I think that's my memory.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:09.520]   But code 2040 has free training programs for black and Latino college engineering students.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.520]   Great.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.520]   Great.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.280]   And I think this is a, this is the kind of thing, although it's surprising how little
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:22.160]   it is for, in terms of Google dollars, Google bucks, but they would love to hire more women
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.320]   and minorities.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:32.200]   And it's a, it's a systemic deep cultural problem that is more than just hiring people
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.560]   who, you know, and so this is a little part of it.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:43.680]   You know, boosting engineering students at the college level is one tiny way to do it.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.560]   But there's, it's, it's, it's barely going to touch the issue as far as I'm concerned.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:53.480]   Well, same in our industry, Mike, you know, yeah, CUNY prides itself on being diverse
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.440]   and we are highly diverse, but we could never do it enough.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.000]   The problem with journalism, journalism has a special problem in that the education
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.600]   that you need in order to be a journalist can, you can make a lot more money not being
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.600]   a journalist.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.600]   Amen.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   That's exactly the problem.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.120]   So, and so if you, if you're from a, if you're from a family, if your parents immigrated
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.600]   from another country or something like that, and you're the one person to ever go to an
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.720]   American university and you go through it all and you have all this education, everybody's
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.040]   going to be disappointed if you take that vow of poverty and become a journalist.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.600]   They're going to want you to go to Wall Street or go into, you know, do something where
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.560]   you're going to make a lot more money.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.880]   So that's a big, big problem.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.800]   Not so much in technology, but that still exists as well because people think that everybody
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.320]   in Silicon Valley makes a ton of money.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.480]   They don't really.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.080]   You know, you're, you know, good, good engineers make pretty good money, but when you have
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.800]   to live in Silicon Valley and pay the cost of living it ends up being, you know, you
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.200]   barely up in the middle class.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.680]   So it's a, it's a, it's a, it's kind of a big problem.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.720]   And, you know, at least they're doing something, I guess that that's something that can be
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.720]   said, but this.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.640]   What's also argument to say that, you know, break up this Silicon Valley technology,
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.040]   Ghetto and do development all around the country, which is happening.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   Yes.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.600]   It is and it isn't.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.200]   It's, it's, there's a lot of that stuff going on, but there's still, there's still
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:29.000]   no substitute for that intense kind of incubator in the air kind of feel and, and, and Silicon
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   Valley.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.720]   It's, there's a, there's a lot to be said for that.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.560]   And there was a study recently that looked at the degree to which that sort of synergistic
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.240]   quality of the culture of Silicon Valley actually had material benefits for the success of companies
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.560]   and stuff like that.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.800]   It is good to see it being diversified and every week, there's another article that like,
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.520]   this is the next Silicon Valley and it's, you know, demarcality.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:56.000]   Speaking of New York and we're going to, we're going to do put stuff here soon, I hope.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   We do now have a robust technology and investment scene in New York and, and it does feed on
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   itself.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.200]   And there's a critic, there's a point in critical mass, but I think we have it now in New York.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.320]   I think what's really happening that that's kind of skewing the picture is that a lot of
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.760]   what we talk about in terms of technology is writing an app, right?
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:22.360]   And writing an app, you can write an app if you specialize in something very highly special,
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:28.120]   you can do that literally anywhere and you can get, you know, you can get rich, you know,
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.960]   a tiny minority will get rich doing it.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.080]   A lot of the technology though that isn't writing an app, you know, sort of deep enterprise
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.000]   software or real hardware that, that has to integrate with other things or, you know,
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.960]   get into the biotech that's happening, a lot of the food technology that's happening in
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.280]   Silicon Valley.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.080]   That stuff is harder to do when you're, I mean New York is, you know, Silicon Alley is,
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.920]   of course, is a, is a hotbed of technology, Massachusetts, a lot of areas like that.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:18:00.040]   But if you talk about outside of the major cities, that's something you really need to
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:04.640]   go to a place like Silicon Valley or New York City or London or someplace like that where
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.560]   you can find lots of support and infrastructure and where you can hire people, you know, a
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   lot of it is where are the universities that specialize in certain things.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.920]   I mean, so if you look at New York, one of the things that New York is just amazing
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.480]   at in terms of the population there is the number of people who are in science, especially
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.440]   oddly enough, science journalism.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.160]   All the science journalists are in New York and half of those are in, and half of those
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.160]   are in Brooklyn.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.440]   They all work for a New Yorker.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.440]   Yes.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.400]   And it's like, and they're very hard to find in Silicon Valley.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   That's interesting.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.040]   It really is really kind of odd.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.920]   But again, where are the universities?
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.120]   You know, they're going to, you're going to find clusters of certain types of people
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.760]   in Massachusetts near Harvard, et cetera.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.520]   And MIT and so on.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.280]   And so, and so you, you know, and let's face it, I mean, Silicon Valley exists because
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.280]   of Stanford.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.280]   Right.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.280]   So, yeah.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.440]   What did you think of this editorial from the New York Times yesterday?
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.600]   Against the right to be forgotten.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.160]   I think it's exactly what we've all been saying for several months.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.680]   And it's nice to see them sort of saying it now, finally.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.040]   But yeah, that's the basic argument.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.560]   Once there's a precedent set where governments can say, "You can't say this on the search
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   engines."
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.720]   Everybody's going to want a piece of that.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.720]   So, China and Turkey and Iran and everybody's going to want to say, "Well, here's our version
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.080]   of the right to be forgotten."
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.720]   We want people to forget the Armenian Genocide.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.480]   Times editorial board wrote, "This position is deeply troubling because it could lead
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.080]   to censorship by public officials who want to whitewash the past."
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.040]   It also sets a terrible example for officials in other countries who might want to demand
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.440]   that internet companies remove links they don't like.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.440]   There's no doubt the internet has made it harder for governments to enforce certain
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.280]   rules and laws because information is not easily contained within borders.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:02.840]   But that does not justify restricting the information available to citizens of other countries.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.360]   It's a free speech issue.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:12.800]   Back from Davos, the media council of which I'm a member, had an important discussion
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:17.320]   about freedom of speech starting with parallel to journalists, but also this is right after
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:28.400]   Charlie Hebdo, it's sobering when you get into a truly international audience how few people
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:36.760]   around the world hold to the free speech absolute view that we Americans have.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.280]   I think that that's part of where the right to be forgotten comes from, even in a very
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.320]   progressive plan of Europe, this idea that there's a balancing of speech.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.440]   I don't buy that myself.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.680]   I think it's very important to say there's a right to remember.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.160]   It's very important to say you can't control knowledge, you can't rewrite history.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.360]   I think the time is a little over doing it, but I'm really glad that wrote the editorial.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:04.760]   At the same time, Google had a frankly hand-picked group of people studying this, and without
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:10.640]   any particular surprise, they said that right to be forgotten should stick to Europe and
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.560]   should not be worldwide.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.800]   At the same time, the EU is going to try to impose their will on the whole world, and
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.080]   I say to them, "The hell with you, you're not going to affect my speech here?"
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   No.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.240]   I have a theory about that, Jeff.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:29.040]   You talked about the idea that Americans tend to be more passionate or more absolutist
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.600]   about free speech than elsewhere, including Europe.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.680]   My theory is that that's not entirely the case.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:41.040]   I think what's different is that I think Americans take the internet more seriously as
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.840]   a bona fide source of content and information than other places.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:51.240]   I get the feeling that in Europe they would never, ever try to impose the same kinds of
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:58.520]   restrictions in novels, in academic studies, in others types of content, other media.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.480]   But the internet, oh, that's just a confection.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.120]   It's just this superficial thing that's annoying.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.120]   It's not real.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.840]   Well, I think that's exactly right.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.000]   I think it's not just the internet.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.760]   It goes back to when I was a TV critic, I would try to defend television, and people
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.560]   would restrict television in a way that they would never consider doing the books.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.560]   I even objected.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.760]   I even got into a tip with Ed Markey on a TV show many, many, many years ago about the
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:28.040]   V-chip that's in cable boxes by government regulation.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.400]   It never came to pass my worst fears, but the worst fear was that if you're the so-called
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.480]   parrotist television counsel, the Howard Stern enemies, you'll just get every show that you
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:43.200]   don't possibly like with a starlet letter, with a V on it, so that it can be blocked
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.240]   across the market.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.440]   And technology would be a hand-maiden to censorship.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.760]   So you're right.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:55.480]   I think that we hold books to be holy in every other medium, pretty much every other
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   medium.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.920]   If you consider the kind of censorship that's occurred in movies over the years, and television
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:05.120]   and the internet is seen as less, but it's all speech, or as the plutrain manifesto would
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.960]   say, it's all conversation.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   Right.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   And we see this type of attitude all over the place.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:17.000]   For example, there's a video game called Hotline Miami 2, which was banned in Australia
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.720]   because there's a rape scene in it.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:24.120]   And so there are a lot of people talking about this, the chattering classes are talking
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.520]   about this and saying, "Oh, well, it's good," because, you know, but apply that to novels.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.760]   Should we say that it should be illegal to have depictions of rape in novels?
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.760]   What about books?
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.160]   What about scientific studies about rape?
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160]   Should those be banned?
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.720]   I mean, where, what is it about video games?
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:46.960]   And this, by the way, is a, this video game is a satire or a criticism of violent video
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.760]   games like Grand Theft Auto.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.760]   That's what the game is.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   It's using the video game format to sort of expose to ridiculous extremes what these
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.640]   games are like.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:09.160]   And to ban on that basically says, "Okay, this is not a legitimate art form like painting.
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:15.440]   You would never put such restrictions on painters or photographers or any of the older existing
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.560]   communications media."
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:22.120]   And this is just an ongoing issue that we're going to have to grapple with eventually.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.800]   I think that, you know, the kid, and by the way, it has to be said.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.680]   I had mentioned that Europeans tend to not take the internet seriously.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.360]   I don't think that's a case among most European populations.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   That's not the people.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.920]   That's the bureaucrats who are that and who are entirely different.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.040]   This is comedically bloody this game.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.040]   Yes.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.200]   It's a ridiculous, we probably shouldn't show it.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.360]   I mean, it's- I don't want to get banned in Australia.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.520]   It's almost eight bit.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.320]   I mean, it's- It's eight, it is eight bits.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   It's on top down.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.600]   It's very, it's obviously tongue-in-cheek.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.160]   But, but I think you were at his excellent point.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.040]   I mean, I think that comes from a out of date notion that video games are for kids.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.640]   And that's obviously out of date.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.640]   Right.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:13.120]   So, speaking of kids, Google has bought Tuntastic, a storyteller app created by Launchpad Games.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   They announced it today.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.200]   They didn't say how much, but they have made Tuntastic free.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.240]   I'm not familiar with it.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.720]   It's for the iPad.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.160]   It's a modern day puppet show.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.800]   You can record them and share them with others.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:31.320]   And Google is working, I guess, on- I don't know what.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.240]   Maybe this is for the new children's YouTube.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.840]   I don't know what this is for.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.800]   Actually, that might be an interesting thing.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.880]   If they have been rumored that it'd be working on a YouTube for kids, maybe let kids make
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.080]   their own videos in this kind of context.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:49.640]   It's not the only acquisition Microsoft, according to TechCrunch today, bought Sunrise,
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   which is a calendar app we've used and recommended.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.240]   We really love on iOS and Android.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:00.240]   Whether they bought a complete, they've turned that into Outlook for iOS.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:06.800]   It sounds like they're Microsoft is acquiring other mobile developers.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.960]   It's so weird to see Microsoft becoming a company that doesn't have a problem about
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.600]   other mobile platforms.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.600]   I love it.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.520]   I think this is a new Microsoft and I welcome them.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:24.640]   We're rolling Stonas teamed up with Google Play to monetize their archives.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:31.320]   So Google Play has a magazine stand, which I'd forgotten because I never use it.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:39.760]   But they're going to take, I guess, archival articles, issues, says three to four major
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.480]   stories from each archive issue for free on Google Play.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.040]   And then I guess all the, it'd be kind of fun to get old rolling stones.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.280]   I use Google Play news all the time.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.040]   I use the news, which is a really great little app.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.360]   I don't replace current, right?
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.120]   And I think it's actually very good.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.120]   I don't know what's the thing.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.120]   What's the thing?
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.440]   I was just thinking, I used to buy magazines by the pound.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.440]   Yeah, I love magazines.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.520]   I started a magazine.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.280]   And the magazine stand I used to buy the most from in Jersey City was near my old office.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.600]   I just saw they tore down and it's gone.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.880]   You can't find news stands anywhere.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.320]   I don't buy magazines anymore.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.920]   I walk by news stands now and I don't even go into them anymore.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.920]   So I don't have the reflex to buy them on an app.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.800]   Yeah, I'm the same way.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.120]   It's all about deep links and going article by article, not even site by site, but article
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:39.880]   by article, which it really kind of is a problem, I think, for the long term health
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.280]   of article aggregators.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.680]   We used to call them magazines.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.040]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040]   You know what I just did though?
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.040]   We had so much fun on our vacation reading the New York Times newspaper every morning.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.040]   I read it every day.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.440]   I just subscribe to the daily delivery of New York Times.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.440]   It's a joy.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.440]   I really like it.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   I got today's.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.440]   Isn't it?
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.240]   And then I get this is what I used to do when I was a radio talk show host.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.000]   I would cut, take a razor blade, cut out articles, put them in a folder, bring them
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   to work.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.200]   Yeah, morgue file.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.280]   Now I keep clicking on the article trying to share it.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.280]   Nothing happens.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.160]   I keep telling people this and they don't believe me.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:21.280]   You know, I look at a screen 12 hours a day and it's like it's the most digital, the most
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:26.520]   technology obsessed people who need print reading material like the New York Times.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.520]   I don't do it.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.520]   I don't do it.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520]   It is a better interface.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.640]   You can scan more articles faster.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.000]   It seems like there are more articles in the print edition than I mean, I've been reading
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.120]   the New York Times and Wall Street Journal online for years.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.920]   It seems like there's more stuff there.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:45.160]   The benefits that the online and digital versions of articles, they always pitch as a benefit,
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.480]   the idea that you can find what you want, which means that you don't find what you don't
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.480]   think you want.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.480]   There's less serendipity.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.040]   And so the New York Times, I like to scan it, forces you to go.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.200]   I can, you know, I can, I can talk intelligently about all kinds of conflicts and issues around
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.120]   the world that are happening that nobody else has even heard of because they're never
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120]   forcefully international.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.000]   You're exactly right.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   That's right.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   Especially international.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.880]   All about the plane crashes in Taiwan.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.200]   We know all about the big splashy stuff that has crazy video.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.520]   We don't know about the little, the little conflicts that are really shaping the world.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.000]   And it's, it's a real problem.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.360]   Jeff, we're trying to support this whole journalism thing.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:26.680]   I think you're holding up the, you're, you're, you're extending the past needlessly.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.920]   The New York Times, we, we subscribe to the New York Times.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.880]   The reason we do is because it's cheaper than subscribing to the New York Times digital
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:32.880]   only.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880]   Because print subscribers are worth more.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.840]   They're artificially pumping up the print.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.180]   And New York Times has now hit, I, they say they're going to hit a million digital only
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.080]   subscribers this year, which is very impressive.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:50.840]   I must say it'd be much higher if they didn't, if they didn't have that, that, that's artificial
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   support for print.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.840]   Right.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.520]   Well, you know, but it has to be said that I think that the real solution that is needed
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:03.040]   here is not that everybody like start reading a black and white newspaper again and getting
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.120]   a home delivery and all this stuff.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.160]   The solution is that we need to figure out a way to make digital devices do what the New
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:15.160]   York Times does, which is expose you to sort of serendipitously to all kinds of things
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.800]   that you are not thinking of at the moment and aren't necessarily related to the kinds
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.560]   of things that you're normally interested in.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.520]   I mean, one of the crazy things about the New York Times, and I've been subscribing since
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.440]   I was in college, is that you, you flip through it and you're, you see in stuff that you just
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.840]   would never even think of.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.800]   You know, what's happening in stage performances in London.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.800]   You know, it's every once in a while there's, there are articles like that that are incredibly
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.840]   interesting and very enlightening and related and relevant to other things that you're thinking
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.320]   about and doing and so on.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.920]   You'd never in a million years see if you were using Google's.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.920]   Okay.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.880]   So you're arguing for serendipity and editors like to think that they are the sole proprietors
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.440]   of serendipity.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.040]   But I've been a go to your favorite service.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.080]   I was on a plane coming back from Davos and I opened up Google+ on the plane and I had
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.560]   no Wi-Fi.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:09.320]   But I just looked at the page that was already loaded there and I opened seven new tabs of
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.760]   interesting things that I saw that when I landed I wanted to look at.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.280]   Twitter you get serendipity from that.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:20.600]   I think it's interesting that the, the, the plane news stand versus Google news.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.680]   And Google news is an overload and it's everything and I don't think they've thought
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:28.440]   through what Google news can be and play is so brand oriented.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.000]   There's something in the middle that will do a better job of giving you serendipity
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   across brands.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   People have tried that.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   People have tried that.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   I mean, flip board.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   But that's not brand.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   Well, even Google news, right?
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.800]   They isn't Google news all about serendi, you know, cross brand serendipity.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.800]   It's trying to be kind of everything.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.480]   And it doesn't, you know, the irony to me is that Google news doesn't personalize much.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.320]   You guys are overlooking something very important.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.640]   The New York Times print edition is very soft and absorbent as well.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.640]   Yes, it is.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.640]   You can use the white clean windows.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.040]   Try that with Google play.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.880]   Try that with my tablet.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.680]   Oh, by the way.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.680]   Yes.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.520]   Just flash here.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.200]   The weight is over my.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.120]   Oh, 502 as well.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   Miracle.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Now, wait a minute now.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   Is that a Verizon?
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.840]   Is that a LTE one or?
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.200]   Stuff rising is T mobile.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.200]   Thank you.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.200]   But it is LTE.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.320]   I think that because I got it on my Wi-Fi Nexus 7 months ago.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   Yeah, so good.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.680]   I don't know why I had to wait.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:31.560]   Now you can unlock your Chromebook with it.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   Don't.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560]   Don't give me a shot.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.360]   If you started, I'm going to talk to you about websites.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.520]   You're not nice to me.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.240]   By the way, they've already said Android 5.1.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.520]   I've already behind.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.480]   It's on the way.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.120]   It's going to ship on Android one phones.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.040]   What is an Android one phone, Jason?
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.040]   I don't even know what that is.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.440]   That's the cheap one in India.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440]   It's in India.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.000]   The low cost, the low cost of micromax devices in India.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.680]   They get Android 5.1, Lolly, popular.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:05.720]   Are they trying to get us angry here now?
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.280]   Then Nexus devices.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.120]   When is it going to come?
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.360]   I don't know if we have a date on that.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.360]   It's out in Indonesia.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.840]   There are devices running 5.1.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.960]   We've been doing that a lot lately.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.560]   They're launching their ara smartphone in Puerto Rico.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.560]   What I make is food trucks.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.560]   From what?
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.560]   From food trucks.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.560]   Food trucks are the distribution mechanism.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.560]   No, you're kidding me.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.560]   I'm not kidding.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560]   I'm going.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.560]   We should bring the Padre and everybody down there.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:35.560]   I mean, you get some fried plantains and an ara phone.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.560]   I hope so.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:40.560]   I hope so.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.560]   Okay.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.200]   I'm done.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.200]   I think we should do it.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.800]   I don't want to talk about it, we talked about it before.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.800]   Microsoft has invested money in them.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.320]   Last week's show, it was after the show, I think, when we mentioned that the Microsoft
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.320]   was investing in cyanogen.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:59.360]   I was wondering why cyanogen was so hostile to Google.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.600]   I have to say that does it.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.600]   Maybe now you know.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.520]   One or the other way around, Microsoft said, "Hey, we like these guys."
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.120]   They said they're going to kill Android.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:12.040]   Should we have a five seconds of silence for Radio Shack?
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.240]   They've been, this has been the longest goodbye in history.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.240]   So I don't know if you have a death scene, isn't it?
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.600]   We knew they were running out of money.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.480]   Now they're talking about selling some of their stores to Sprint.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.480]   Amazon.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:28.320]   Amazon wants to buy a handful for what distribution centers?
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.600]   Distribution centers to show, it also has little mini Apple stores to show off their
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:38.280]   hardware devices, but also mostly, you know, pickup locations instead of having lockers,
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   which they tried at 7-11.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.320]   They have one test, and I think it's Indiana, Purdue or someplace like that.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:44.320]   Purdue and averse.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.560]   Yeah, both have.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.560]   And they're not tests.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.560]   They're all full in.
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.480]   I actually think this is kind of terrible.
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.680]   Radio Shack was, there were thousands of stores and it was the one place in many areas
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.480]   of the country where you could get electronics parts.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:34:59.880]   They kind of got away from that.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.360]   I think that's one of the reasons, we talked about this like two months ago when we first
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.160]   heard them in trouble, but I feel like they messed the boat.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.680]   If Radio Shack had said, "No, no, we're going to go after the maker movement.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.840]   We're going to become an electronics center, a hobbyist center."
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840]   They might have survived.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.480]   Being another place to buy a smartphone seems like a bad idea.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.520]   The problem is that, you know, we're familiar with Fry's out here.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.880]   And Fry's is like, imagine a Radio Shack that's the size of a Costco.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.600]   And this really works, especially there's several of them in Silicon Valley.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.920]   They're packed to the gills.
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:33.520]   They also sell electronics and vacuum cleaners and watch it.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.800]   Even in areas where people are smart enough and wired enough to buy online, they still
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.800]   go to brick and mortar.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   Exactly.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.080]   The other shock is that they existed in an era where to have an electronic device was
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.400]   to tinker with it in some way, or program it or whatever.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.160]   And nowadays people just want to buy this appliance and forget about it, except for
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:53.160]   the makers.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.640]   And the makers, the world is so much more complex now.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.560]   A store that would really serve the maker community would have to be enormous.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.560]   Maybe, yeah.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560]   And Radio Shack's are tiny.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.880]   They have all these retail outlets, more than 4,000 of them.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.880]   They used to have a lot more.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.880]   4,000.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.880]   Wow.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.040]   These are tiny little stores that can't really serve, they can have soldering irons and batteries
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.040]   and things like that.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:19.200]   But really, a real maker person is, Radio Shack's not big enough to hold all the things they
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.080]   might need, unless they were 3D printing it, in which case that might make it.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:24.080]   Maybe this is the right end.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.080]   They sell it sprint.
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.040]   They become sprint stores, about half of them.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.680]   The rest Amazon, Amazon Shack, they could call it.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.880]   Why not sell it to Google?
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   Google.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.880]   You got the money.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880]   Buy these.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.880]   I've bought all these.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.880]   They were going to build barges.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.920]   Because they're doing all these weird things.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.320]   No, just go the straight way.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:45.080]   Get Radio Shack, put all your nexus in your nest and everything in there.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.080]   Everything in there.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.680]   And people can actually play with them.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.720]   Who needs the food truck?
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.320]   There's an outside chance that some of these stores may become co-branded Radio Shack.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.520]   Remember, Radio Shack's not going to have business.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.000]   They're declaring bankruptcy.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.720]   They may co-brand them with sprint.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.320]   So they become sprint Radio Shack stores.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.880]   That's a dark horse.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   Right.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.560]   But that is one of the possibilities here that has to be mentioned.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.480]   Brookstone is also evaluating right?
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.640]   Brookstone's thinking about it.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.240]   There's a high tech company for you.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.240]   Get the Messiah.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.040]   Brookstone is like the next to go.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.040]   Right.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.880]   You suck like, right.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.280]   Out of the frying pan into the fire.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.480]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   I've got a cool tool.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:28.000]   Jeff's got a number and we're going to let Mike find a thing.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   Look for your thing, Mike.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.600]   It's got to be here somewhere.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.600]   Where'd you see it last?
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.040]   You don't want to know.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:37.960]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com, L-Y-N-D-A.com.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.360]   I've known Linda Wyman since the screen savers day.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.720]   She is still a great educator.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.800]   Was doing books on web design and creating a website.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:48.800]   They have branched out.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.240]   Oh, have they branched out.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:57.160]   If you go to Linda.com right now, you'll see an amazing array, 4,500 courses on anything
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.040]   you can imagine.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.040]   Web development.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.720]   Also photography.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.760]   Visual design.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.280]   Business skills like negotiating, writing a resume.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.760]   Software training, Excel, WordPress, Photoshop.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.480]   If you're a programmer, what a great place to go to expand your skills.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:21.720]   I'm reading, studying up on the Swift programming language at Linda.com.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.040]   This is my interface right here.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.000]   All the courses really well produced.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.840]   They all have transcriptions, which is really great.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.320]   You can search the transcription and find the part you want.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:41.120]   They divide it up very nicely into a lot of chapters.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.280]   They seamlessly stitch together, but you can jump right to, you want to know more about
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.680]   creating and using arrays.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.760]   You can jump right to that part of the course.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.120]   New courses all the time.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:56.000]   If you want to improve your job skills, if you want to ask the boss for arrays or make
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.160]   yourself more marketable, if you're looking to expand your abilities and your hobby to
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.080]   set new financial goals to find a better work-life balance, linda.com, that's something for everyone.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:12.680]   Of course, I'm looking at right now SEO fundamentals, Google Sites essential training,
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.560]   up and running with a Google Cloud platform that teaches you how to develop and host apps,
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.080]   websites, analyze data, create and manage cloud-based databases with Google Cloud.
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.320]   It is incredible.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.280]   By the way, if you're a podcaster, look at all the things you can learn, mastering,
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:35.000]   mixing live performance, the business of music, the production of music, recording techniques,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.240]   every kind of music software, every kind of recording software.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.440]   This is amazing.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.120]   Logic Pro 10 essential training.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.320]   By the way, when new stuff comes out, when Logic got updated, immediately, they've got
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.840]   courses taught by experts in the business who happen to be great trainers too.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:53.840]   Listen to yourself.

[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.760]   This is a good deal.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:23.040]   At linda.com/twig, somebody's pointing out that Staples is trying to buy office Depot.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:27.100]   I think it really is a tough time for brick and mortar right now.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   Really tough.
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.100]   Who was it?
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.840]   Was it you, Jeff, somebody was saying that the future, if you really want to look at the
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:36.520]   future of retail, it's in high-touch, high-service.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.080]   It's not being a place where people go to buy stuff.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.080]   It's marketing.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.080]   It's marketing.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.080]   It's marketing.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.080]   It's about training.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.000]   It's about creating a relationship.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.080]   There's so much you can do with it.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.440]   I think about the independent bookstores that have survived.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.440]   They're not trying to compete with Amazon.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.920]   They're not putting every book on the shelf.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.360]   They have author, book signings, author speaking.
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:03.120]   They have smart clerks who can help you find the right book.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120]   It's about service.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.840]   I think there is an opportunity still for brick and mortar.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.640]   I don't see every school proposing downtown.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.960]   It was the last time you were to Best Buy.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.960]   Ages.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:13.960]   Well, go to Best Buy now.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.480]   You're going to be amazed.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.880]   Huge gigantic space solely limited to Samsung.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.520]   Huge space to Microsoft.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.520]   Small space to Google.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520]   Well, you know why that is?
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.520]   Huge space to Sony.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520]   These are basically--
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.160]   It's all co-op marketing dollars.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.160]   Sony says--
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.160]   It's co-op marketing.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.160]   That's what it is.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.800]   We want to buy 150 square feet.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.800]   That's what it is.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:37.840]   And Best Buy says if you want to get your products sold, you can either put them with
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.480]   18 other products in a dusty shelf that no one's paying any attention to, or you can
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.480]   buy a set up a store Apple did this.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.480]   Well, here's the other product.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480]   The Gold Center's Apple, for sure.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.480]   Here's the other product, the business model.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:53.360]   So, if you go into Best Buy and you play with the Samsung phone there, Samsung doesn't
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.560]   care whether you buy it and Best Buy or not.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.160]   Samsung says this is our marketing, this is our touch opportunity to show you the things
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.160]   for you.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160]   Wonderful it is.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.160]   Right.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.560]   And I've talked in the past, I'm involved with a retail genius named Sean Samsung, who
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.240]   has this vision for the future retail.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.200]   I mentioned it in public parts briefly.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.680]   And he's a visionary about this stuff.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.880]   And I think that's where retail goes is toward marketing.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.480]   And we're starting to see the beginnings of this.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.440]   Very interesting.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:25.520]   But retail as a whole as an industry becomes much smaller, far more efficient.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.520]   I don't know about you, but I get frustrated every time a retail space opens up, what goes
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]   in?
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.520]   A bank.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.520]   A bank.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.520]   And in Penilumet, it's antique store.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.520]   And antique store.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.520]   Right.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.520]   And antique store.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:38.520]   Even the bank has an antique store.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.520]   Yes.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.600]   But I want, I now work in the center of the universe, if we do say so ourselves.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.600]   Times Square.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.600]   Times Square.
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.360]   I've got to walk 20 minutes to find a bookstore.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.880]   I got to walk 20 minutes to find Best Buy.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:51.880]   That's sad.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:52.880]   That's really sad.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.880]   There's nothing to browse.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.800]   I used to go out at lunch hour when I was pissed off and angry and I'd call myself out
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.360]   by browsing record store and a bookstore and electronics store.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360]   All gone.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   All gone.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.480]   That's really sad.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.480]   That's life.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.560]   But I think that's maybe because of the shortsightedness of the retailers who didn't understand what
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.560]   business they were in.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.360]   They thought they were in the business of selling goods.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.360]   Yes.
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.440]   Which, by the way, was a really awful business.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.440]   Right.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:18.840]   You had a capital risk.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840]   You had pilfridge.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.840]   All kinds of awful things going on.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:23.840]   Low margins.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.840]   Okay.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:25.840]   Jeffrey Jarvis.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:26.840]   Number three weeks.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.840]   Jeffrey Jarvis.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.000]   If I don't say to anger you, Paul.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000]   Jeffrey.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.600]   What's your middle name?
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.600]   Alan.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:35.600]   Jeffrey.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:36.600]   Alan Jarvis.
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.600]   You get in here.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   What's your?
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.000]   What's your number of the week?
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.920]   524 million.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.960]   Skolded bad ads killed by Google.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:50.960]   What?
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:51.960]   Last year.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:52.960]   524 million.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.760]   What was bad about them?
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:55.760]   Okay.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.640]   I'll tell you.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.320]   That amounted to 214,000 advertisers, which is interesting to me that basically on an average
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.200]   of two ads, you know, kills you.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.960]   That's because these people weren't real advertisers.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.120]   They were malware vendors and things like that.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.120]   Right.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:12.240]   7,000 promoted counterfeit goods.
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.200]   Down from 14,000 a year before.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.280]   Down from 82,000 a year before that.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.840]   So they say they were making progress.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:26.720]   Malicious software was 250,000 to sites doing that in general.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.720]   And then things like weight loss schemes.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.560]   You mean those belly fat ads?
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.560]   Yep.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.560]   Belly fat.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.760]   I can has it.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:43.080]   And so it's pretty amazing that Google's the cop of the world and has to constantly worry
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.720]   about killing bad ads because it's bad for the Google brand.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.160]   It's bad to rip off the users.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:52.440]   Well, they've also set up a system where you can anonymously without any human intervention
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:53.920]   buy an ad.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.840]   So they've set it up so that bad actors have easy access.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.840]   Exactly.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:03.520]   They've also been taken to task and fined for bad medical ads.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.000]   And so they have an obligation to do this.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.520]   But it's a cost of doing business for them.
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.600]   So there's something I wonder whether Matt Cutts has been involved in that.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.120]   It's kind of like spam, but I bet you they have a whole division dedicated to this.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.480]   Oh, but it's, but it's, there's a science of saying how are the bad guys going to act.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.960]   That's my number.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.480]   There's his number.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.640]   Do you want to do a tip or should I?
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.480]   Either way, I can go.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:28.480]   Go.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480]   Epicurious.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   Love it.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   Yes.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:36.360]   It's a foodie magazine and they just a week ago or so updated their website and now they
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.600]   have updated their apps.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.480]   I wonder if I have the latest.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.440]   Well, the Android app has not yet been updated any minute now.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:44.880]   I know it's with the web pages.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:45.880]   A lot of websites.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.040]   But that's from 2010.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.040]   That version of the app.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.440]   The new version is absolutely.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.440]   Here.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.440]   Let's get an iOS.
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.920]   Let's get a real phone over here.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.160]   You can poke around with that.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.440]   Oh, first of all, it's changed to a lighter red.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.440]   Yes.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.640]   So they've got it's a very contemporary design, very high performance.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640]   All around the search.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:06.640]   Very fast.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640]   That's exactly it.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:08.640]   It's a search that's super good.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.640]   It's Google like search.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:13.760]   It's not Google is not the engine behind it, but the quality of the search is this
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.400]   Condi is Condi Nast.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400]   Yes.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400]   I was there.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.680]   I was part of the team at the original Epicurious years and years ago.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:26.440]   A woman named Joan Feeney and Rochelle Eudel did brilliant work starting epi long ago.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.080]   So the idea is it's not it's a search across a variety of Condi.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.080]   Exactly.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.520]   If you hit the hamburger with not the actual hamburger, yeah, there you go.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.680]   And go to home.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.240]   You'll see that it has this.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.240]   Okay.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.240]   I'm at home.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:42.240]   So there's an interview.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.240]   You hit that thing right below the search.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.240]   Browse by Cadagari.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.240]   There you go.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.240]   Oh, kid friendly, quick and easy, healthy food.
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:48.240]   Lots of stuff like that.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.340]   Do you even have any ingredient?
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:50.840]   What's in season in your area?
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:51.840]   So these are a little kitchen.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.520]   What can I make with bourbon?
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.520]   No available recipes.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   Here we go.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000]   32,000.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.400]   Bourbon, there's 185 bourbon recipes.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:04.480]   Chocolate fudge with bourbon, trouble and paradise, peach, ginger and bourbon.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:11.000]   Now what's great about this too is that there's the cooks, um, rate them, but they also modify
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   them.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000]   They make suggestions about this.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000]   So there's the example I use.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   You refuse that.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000]   Right.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.240]   So you can, when you ever see ingredients you like, you can save it to your shopping list.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:22.960]   You can get alerts on your shopping list when you're near a store that has those things.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:26.240]   You can have them here at the store and might get a tablespoon of bourbon, would you?
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.240]   I will do.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.240]   Yeah, you can make it.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.280]   And it also has voice commands who can interact with the recipes by voice because you've got,
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.120]   you have like, you know, stuff all over your hands because you're cooking.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.720]   You can talk to your phone to interact with the recipe and it will tell you what's going
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   on with the recipe.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.960]   Um, lots of different categories, you know, like you guys just saw.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.680]   It's going to be used in the Elgin home to very good.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:48.680]   That's right.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.680]   This brings the recipe specifically from Bon Appetit, self random house and others.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.800]   Or maybe at rest in peace.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.800]   And you can comment and sort of interact with it's like a social network for people cooking,
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.160]   which is kind of a cool idea.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.160]   There are lots of recipes.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.440]   I've been using big oven, which is a kind of recipe aggregator has millions of recipes,
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.680]   but the problem is you don't know what the quality is going to be.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.120]   These are all from, these are all published recipes at least.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.120]   Right.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.320]   Well, and here's a little story from the early days of Epicurious.
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.560]   So, so we had the right to use all the recipes from gourmet and bon Appetit.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:21.800]   How could you beat that?
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:24.120]   They were all just in print.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.160]   So we had to get them re-typed and we hired a, well, I didn't know this at the time, but
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:30.880]   there was this honest to God asked Padre.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.640]   There was a service with monks.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.480]   Rather than making fruitcake, they were typists or illustrating Bibles.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:38.480]   Right.
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:40.480]   Was that in the months they had a scriptoria?
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:41.480]   Right.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.480]   Exactly.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.040]   So the monks re-typed all the recipes that created Epicurious.
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.840]   Spicy upscale popcorn.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:50.840]   Goodbye to international ingredient.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.120]   Since we're on foodie stuff, have you gone to, do you use foodie?
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:56.120]   Mike?
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:57.120]   No, what's foodie?
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.280]   Foodie is from Glam, my friends at Glam are now known as mode.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:02.280]   Is it a website?
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.520]   Yeah, it's an irrigation.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.480]   It's a website aggregation.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.920]   And it's foodie dot just people saving recipes.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.880]   It's like the Pinterest of calories.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.880]   It's like, and it's amazing.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.880]   It's amazing.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.960]   Oh, oh, signing up.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.200]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.200]   Oh.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.120]   I just want to start eating things.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.600]   See, this can't be good for a diet.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.600]   No.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.440]   No, I don't have a diet button.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440]   Right.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.720]   It says I'm on a diet only show me food.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.720]   It looks disgusting.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.080]   It's a tie into quantified self stuff.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.280]   And it should, if you're, if you're already over right, it should just not show you this
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.280]   stuff.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.280]   Right.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.280]   Give me a break.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.280]   Samoa cheesecake.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:40.360]   This is a cheesecake that looks like a Girl Scout cookie.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:44.320]   Castleback sweet potatoes with Parmesan and sage.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.480]   Is it named after David Hasselbeck?
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.960]   This is from Jimmy.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.480]   This is from a site called gimmesomeoven.com.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480]   I like it.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.480]   Oh, these are great.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.480]   Don't you love foodies?
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.640]   F-O-O-Z-I-E.com.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.120]   This is nice, Jeff.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.120]   Is this?
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:59.120]   I like it.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.880]   And this is, and what this does is send the traffic.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.560]   If you click on a recipe, you'll go to a page that stole foodie that mentions, you know,
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.080]   some of the ingredients and stuff, but you don't get the whole recipe there.
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.080]   You only get it when you go to the creator's site.
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.000]   So it's a way to send traffic to the creator's sites along the way.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.400]   And Glenn will be doing more of this in the future.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.120]   Well, I am now a foodie member.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.120]   I signed up.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:23.120]   Look at that.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:24.120]   Nice.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.040]   Do they have another companion site called NUTI?
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.120]   Because I would go there too.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.120]   It's a great site.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.120]   You can go there and not buy clothes.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.200]   There's a commerce model that is really working.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.840]   I am not going to make this.
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.080]   White chocolate covered Ritz crackers.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:40.920]   Nope, nope, not going to make it.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.920]   Not going to do it.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:42.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:45.680]   Packaged food like Ritz crackers is not an ingredient.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.680]   It's not an ingredient.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:47.680]   I see.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:49.520]   I'm stuck in somebody's head.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.160]   Oh, you would love this restaurant.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.160]   They had a dessert made of Nutella.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.600]   And I said, you know, I don't go to restaurants where they take the dessert out of a jar.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.440]   Thank you.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:02.400]   On the other hand, chocolate chip cookies in a jar.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.200]   Maybe I do that.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.200]   Mmm.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.200]   That's a gift.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:08.640]   Oh, hey, we got that.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.360]   We got that for Christmas, actually.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.440]   It's the whole thing, right?
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.440]   Everything you need to make.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:13.440]   Yeah, it's all the ingredients.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.440]   Yes.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:15.440]   And it looks all nifty in the jar.
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.440]   We haven't made it yet.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440]   We need to make it.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.640]   That's so clever.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.320]   It comes with everything you need.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.680]   It's kind of like a blue apron for chocolate chip cookies.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:26.080]   Look at even the, did they, did they put the measuring?
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:27.880]   I didn't get, I didn't get that.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.280]   Ah, she goes cookie jar.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.280]   That's a little bit of it.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.960]   I'm going to have to talk to whoever gets that gift.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.040]   You're supposed to put measuring spoons.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:35.040]   It's okay.
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:36.040]   We have tons of measuring.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.000]   That's the last thing you need more of.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   All right.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.320]   My tip, there's a genesis to this story.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:45.160]   We had talked before about Google's App Inventor.
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.720]   This was a system that Google had created to make it very easy to write Android apps.
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:53.200]   Not sophisticated Android apps, but children and people like me, hobbyists, could learn
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:57.520]   how to write software and learn how to write it for Android phones and actually package
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:01.200]   their software up not only for their own phone, but for sale on the Play Store.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.200]   And it was a really great thing.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.520]   Google gave it up.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:04.720]   They gave it to MIT.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:08.160]   MIT has released App Inventor 2.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:16.080]   I've been looking to write an app for a Nexus 7 tablet that would help me with a radio show.
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.960]   And I started, I downloaded the new Google integrated development engine and all this
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:22.960]   stuff.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:23.960]   And it was just like, oh, please.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:24.960]   It was way over my head.
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.880]   I said, I don't have time to learn all this stuff.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:31.120]   So I downloaded this.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:36.000]   And this is the coolest thing ever, and everybody's got to try this.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000]   It's free.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.360]   If you go to appinventor.mit.edu, you create new projects.
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.240]   I'll show you, I have a few projects.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.240]   They have pretty good tutorials.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:47.000]   In fact, this is the first tutorial.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000]   I'll show you this one.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000]   It's called Talk to Me.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.840]   And the first thing you're going to do is you're going to connect to your phone.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:57.520]   Now, I don't know why my-- but here, if you can-- I don't know if you can see my phone.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:04.720]   So I'm going to connect to my AI companion by.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.680]   You're going to have to follow me on this one.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.680]   It's a little complicated.
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.680]   Now go to my screen.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:09.680]   There you go.
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.680]   This QR code.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.480]   I scanned the QR code into the phone.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:19.800]   Now, it's given me a code where both on the same Wi-Fi, the app appears on the phone.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:22.440]   And as you modify the app, it is instantly.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.440]   No USB connection.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.680]   Let me-- this is the designer.
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.040]   She designed the UI here.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.120]   And they've got a lot of tools.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.960]   They've got buttons, checkboxes, layout tools.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.440]   They've even got Lego Mind Storm tools.
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:37.840]   If you have Lego Mind Storm, storage, social, sensors.
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:42.520]   You can use the accelerometer, the barcode, this clock, the location, all of the stuff
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:43.800]   on your phone.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:44.800]   Then you go into blocks.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.800]   Look at this.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.200]   This is the programming interface.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.440]   So I put on the screen a text box.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:54.120]   These are all the commands I can use for the text box.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.640]   And text to speech.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:59.200]   Let's set this up.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.000]   I'm going to write.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.480]   Now, by the way, if you saw that message in there, just ignore that.
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:07.480]   I was showing the 12-year-old how to do this.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:12.080]   And he decided to put profane messages in here.
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.120]   So that-- but that's cool, right?
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.440]   What better way to get a kid into programming?
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:23.800]   So I know your son Kevin does a tinker, which is a similar kind of a system on iOS.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.480]   So I have now written this software.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.240]   It is on the phone instantly.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:27.920]   And watch.
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:28.960]   I could do a couple of things.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:31.680]   If I shake-- let me turn up the volume here.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.720]   If I shake the phone, I've told it to say something.
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:36.400]   Stop shaking me.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.560]   Stop shaking me.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:39.040]   But I can also enter some text.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.000]   This is an actual Android app.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.760]   This is some text.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.640]   It took me about three seconds to write, honestly.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:47.480]   And I can speak it.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.800]   This is some text.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:50.360]   But the point is you now have an app.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:55.920]   And as you modify the app on your screen on the app inventor,
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.880]   it will immediately go over to your phone through the Wi-Fi.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:02.600]   You can prototype, turn it around very quickly.
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.120]   It's got a great programming interface.
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:07.240]   Show the screen again, if you would, Jason.
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:07.720]   It's not shaking me.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:08.120]   I know.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.920]   I'm shaking you.
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.240]   It's got all of this stuff built in logic, math, text.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:14.560]   And they're all snappable.
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.360]   So for instance, if you put something in here,
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.120]   if you drag it onto the interface,
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:22.680]   it'll show you puzzle pieces.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.680]   And only things with that shape can go into there.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:27.920]   It is spectacular.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.560]   I was able to get the accelerometer sensor working
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.240]   in such a way that when the accelerometers start shaking,
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:39.600]   call text to speech, and then speech this message.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.680]   That's just a text message, which snaps on there
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.600]   like a puzzle piece.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:46.160]   Folks, if you've been interested in programming,
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.120]   if you have an Android device and you'd
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.080]   like to learn a little bit more about it,
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:52.480]   if you want an easy way to create your own apps,
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.800]   or even, believe it or not, the ability
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:58.160]   to package these up, apps that you could sell or give away
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.280]   on the Play Store, you've got to take a look.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.000]   They've really made something special here.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.880]   The MIT App Inventor 2.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.000]   And I feel pretty good about this.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.040]   I feel like I'm going to be able to write the very simple software
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:11.600]   I needed to be a timer for the radio show.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:14.400]   I want it to flash red when I'm running out of time.
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.280]   And green when I have some time left and countdown
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:20.160]   so I can go to the bathroom and look, oh, I've got a minute left.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.440]   I've needed this for some time.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.200]   I wrote something in AppleScript ages ago,
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:25.600]   but I'll put this next to seven.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.120]   Problem isn't you're going to be in the bathroom
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.600]   and it's going to say, stop shaking me.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.600]   Stop shaking me.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.320]   Stop shaking me.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.560]   Stop shaking me.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.040]   Stop shaking me.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:37.560]   Stop shaking me.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.280]   You can change it.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:41.440]   I could actually change this to stop shaking me, Mike.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.400]   And look how fast it changes that.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:45.040]   Stop shaking me, Mike.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:45.360]   Great.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.280]   Throw me under the glass.
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:48.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are done with this weekend.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.240]   Google, Mike, you all got always great to have you.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:52.840]   You can't just--
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.520]   Always great.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.720]   Monday through Friday, 10 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time,
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.400]   1800 UTC for your daily dose of tech news.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.760]   You're going to Barcelona.
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:02.680]   Barcelona, yes.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.640]   Looking forward to it to cover mobile world congress.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.600]   Early next month?
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.400]   Yes, very early.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.240]   Yes, I think.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.240]   Second through fifth.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.280]   Second through fifth.
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.680]   So live reports.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.720]   You and Jason, all your three, is Samsung
[01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:17.400]   going to redeem itself with the next phone?
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.520]   I like the Note 4.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:19.960]   I think the Note 4 is actually great.
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:21.640]   Oh, you mean in its keynote presentation?
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.240]   Yes, six.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:22.920]   Yes.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.080]   I think they might.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.720]   I'm rooting for the new edge with the edge on both sides.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:29.680]   The edge on both sides.
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:32.520]   Make it more mainstream and make it kind of work better.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.200]   Like you pointed out all the flaws on it.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.440]   But I'd love something like that.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.480]   And I'm going to price down a little bit.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.560]   But it's going to be something curved no matter what.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.040]   I guarantee something--
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.120]   Well, mobile world congress has become--
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:43.240]   I forget CES now.
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:45.600]   I really think that the most interesting stuff's happening
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:46.280]   in Barcelona.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.680]   What do you think?
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:49.240]   He wants to go.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.040]   Those are neat things.
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.040]   He wishes he was going.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.920]   Yeah, it's really a bummer that I can't be there.
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:53.600]   But--
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:54.320]   Can't send all of you.
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:55.280]   That's what Jason's saying.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:57.280]   Not everybody's going.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.120]   I'll be curious to see what they do.
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:03.000]   I mean, the invite clearly for the event clearly
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.720]   showed the contour of the edge.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.040]   So I don't know if that means new note edge, or the S6 now
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.880]   has edge in it.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.880]   And that's just the new design of the S6.
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.320]   Do you think they'll redeem themselves?
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:18.880]   I think so.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.360]   I think they're on the right track.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.240]   I think they're changing their approach.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:27.280]   The non-fore is a great device.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.640]   I think the S5 was a little crafted up.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:32.040]   But the no-fore is great.
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.160]   I don't think Samsung needs to redeem itself.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:37.000]   It does in its presentations, if that's what you--
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.880]   Here's the invitation.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:39.960]   What's next?
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.120]   I don't know.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:46.520]   Everybody's expecting a more metallic body, metallic design,
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.840]   as opposed to the plastic.
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.280]   I think they're going to do a haptic work.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:49.880]   Yes.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:50.480]   That's what I think.
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.160]   It'll only work the Samsung Galaxy S6.
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.560]   And nothing else.
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.280]   So we will be covering a mobile world congress.
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:57.360]   It was cheap.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.240]   Michael be there.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.600]   Now, because of the time difference,
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:00.840]   all the stuff that's happening is happening
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.080]   in the middle of the night.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.720]   California time, but you're still going to do it.
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.600]   Yes.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.800]   OK.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:10.960]   1 AM Pacific, 4 AM Eastern time.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.460]   Right.
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:15.480]   Tune in, because that's 9 AM in Barcelona, or 10 AM--
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:17.880]   We'll just be back from dinner.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:20.960]   Well, you don't have dinner in Spain until 11 PM or something.
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:21.240]   Right.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:21.800]   No.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.560]   11 PM.
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.120]   What are you?
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:23.880]   2 AM.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.000]   Come on.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:25.800]   You're early.
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:26.360]   Eat or what do you have?
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:29.040]   60 years old?
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.520]   Thank you.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:33.760]   That's when the early bird specials are at the Denny's
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.200]   Barcelona.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.080]   Thank you for joining us, everybody.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.280]   Thank you to Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York,

[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.440]   Hold up the book.
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.200]   Hold up the book.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.440]   Imagining new features.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.200]   Look at that.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.440]   It's a geek bearing a gift.
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:52.880]   There he is.
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:54.360]   That's a gift just for you.
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:56.040]   Shake, shake me harder.
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:58.400]   Shake me harder.
[01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.280]   Oh boy.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.280]   Please.

[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.640]   Thanks for joining us.

[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.000]   But I guess you could just go to--
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:42.680]   Hey, no we do.
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:42.880]   We do.

[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:46.320]   Live Twit.live.tv.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.480]   Well, it's a website.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:48.120]   Yeah.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.200]   We have an extension.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.000]   That's the extension.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.520]   Go to live.twit.tv.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:52.240]   I know.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.000]   I have the extension.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:53.840]   It's really great.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:54.240]   Really?
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:54.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:55.720]   Somebody wrote an extension.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.160]   It's called floating twit.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:57.840]   Boom.
