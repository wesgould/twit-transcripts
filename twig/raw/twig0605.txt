[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.840]   Mike Elkins joining us from Oaxaca, Mexico.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.320]   Jeff Jarvis is here from New Jersey and Pruitt from just down the street.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.080]   Everybody wants to be Clubhouse.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.080]   We'll talk about some of the companies that are creating Clubhouse clones.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.800]   No, it's not a problem that Google collects more telemetry from Android devices than Apple.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.320]   And then it's okay to Google your symptoms.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.840]   Why it's not going to make you sicker.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.920]   From the verse of the Google and the verse of the Federation of the Fede of the Facebookies.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.440]   And I don't know what else we do.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   Anything we want.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.440]   That's what we want.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.640]   Hey, it's Aunt Pruitt.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.400]   Lo and behold, Aunt Pruitt's here from Hands On Photography.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.480]   He's laughing at me.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.600]   He knew it was about a without you, sir.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.080]   He knew.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.640]   I've been with you.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.240]   He knew it was about out of proud.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.120]   Want to give him credit.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.080]   I got it.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.160]   I'll explain in a second.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.040]   Also with the Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Taill professor for...
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.320]   Oh, he's reading.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.880]   I have another moral panic.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.840]   He's reading Cohen.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.440]   The Leonard Taill professor for journalistic...
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.880]   The original moral panic.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.160]   The original moral panic.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   Look, now we figure out a way to double lower third use so it's a lower half.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.200]   The Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the...
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.360]   Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.880]   He looks like Kilroyd with your nose just hanging over the fence over your lower third.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.240]   What's a big notice to hang over?
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.000]   Thank you for being here, Jeff.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.320]   And Stacy, as we mentioned last week has the day off,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.920]   but Mike Elgin has decided it would be okay to join us in quarantine.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.800]   He's in the beautiful state of Wahaka.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.480]   And that is right.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.280]   I mean, for Jeff, moral panic is an academic subject,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   but for me, I live it every day.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.000]   He's moral panic the man.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.120]   You're one of the coolest people I know Mike Elgin.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.160]   You're one of the coolest people I've ever had.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.920]   Ant-Proit is calmer than you are.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.520]   You're a pretty sum.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   He is.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   He is.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   He is.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.320]   He is.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.720]   He is.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.920]   We're a calm bunch.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   I have my moments.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.480]   Trust me.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   Well, last week we talked about the Ever Given,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.400]   which is now blessedly unstuck from the Suez Canal.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.120]   It's just sitting in the lake thinking about whether it wants to go through the rest of the
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.960]   canal. There's a lake in the middle and it's going, "I don't know. Should we go on? What's the point?"
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.080]   It was so nice being in the center of the universe and all the attention.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.240]   Oh.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.680]   Now nobody wants me anymore.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.640]   They don't care.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.760]   So we have a wonderful listener I've known for some time.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.240]   Captain Sam, she was a merchant, a vessel captain and mate for a long time.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.120]   And she sent me a note saying,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.720]   "You dorks. You have a knife."
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.600]   First, there was much gnashing of teeth.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.320]   First, she says, "It's bow, not proud."
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.040]   And you're right.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.280]   I said prowl, but it's a bulbous bow because below the waterline.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.720]   And that's what you and Pruitt thought, but you were too polite to say anything.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.920]   She also said, "So she says subject is bow, not prowl."
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.320]   Imagine the gnashing of teeth.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.240]   The ship wasn't stuck so long.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.760]   My ship was stuck over a month in Tabletop Beige sent me the article from 2007.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.120]   "I wish I didn't watch on delay so I could have put my two cents in
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.320]   with great hyperbole."
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.560]   Okay. It's funny listening to the non-mariners make statements about ships.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.280]   Thank you, Sam.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   Captain Purdle.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.520]   Wait till she hears us talk about Google.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.560]   Yeah, we know even less about Google.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.200]   So there.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.440]   So there.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.240]   Will we talk about Google?
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.040]   You read anything about how it was freed in detail.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   The Guardian had a great story.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.360]   They shifted the cap.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.760]   I'm sorry, I've got to mess this up.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.480]   You got to come up.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.920]   You landlubber-hoo.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.720]   Number one, they won.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.840]   Of course it was a supermoon tide, which made a big difference.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   So it was higher.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.120]   Big tide.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.080]   And when it went out, that created a certain forest.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.320]   They put ballast in the back to force it up.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.040]   The nose bow prowl up, yes.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.880]   And then freed it at the right moment.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.080]   And it was quite amazing.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.120]   It was no simple.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.520]   They were all kinds of mathematical calculations
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.000]   to figure out how much to shift the ballast and all kinds of things.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.720]   See kids, be cool, stay in school, learn your math.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.680]   You might need it someday to free your ship.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.800]   I just love the fact that there was,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.240]   there was, well, I don't love the fact that there was a lot of
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.760]   economic downside, but there are going to be a ton of lawsuits.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.200]   Putting the Sioux in the Sioux-esque canal.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.240]   That's the point of the like.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.080]   Oh, he was waiting up on that.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.280]   He had to come on the show this week.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.320]   Just for that moment.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.920]   And you can catch that now.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.200]   You can catch more of that great humor in Mike's new sub-stack.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.320]   Mike Elgin.substack.com.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.520]   So you just take a--
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.880]   Take a prow, Mike Elgin.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.360]   So you've always had Elgin's list, but you never charged for it.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.440]   So you decided maybe it'd be nice to make some money on it.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.160]   Well, what I'm doing is, Mike's list is a bunch of frivolous Tom Foolery.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.280]   I basically call it brilliantly bad ideas.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.920]   It's basically people who are complete geniuses who pour enormous engineering
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.080]   knowledge into some stupid thing.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.920]   And I just love those kind of stories.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.480]   And that's what Mike's list has been about mostly--
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.200]   And I've always loved it.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.320]   You know, some practical things.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.280]   Yeah, it's--
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.240]   But now what I'm doing is I'm adding an actual opinion column.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.160]   And I'm charging for that.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.320]   So Mike's list is free.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.200]   Everything that I've always published for free is still free.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   And then if you want to read the opinion column, you can give me money.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.160]   And I will show it to you.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.960]   So it's really working great, actually.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.560]   And in fact, sometimes you have a whole piece on piloting a tanker through the Sufess canal.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.280]   Is this a game?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.600]   Yes.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.560]   It's a thing I believe CNN organized, but it's basically a game.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.640]   Yeah, you-- the win changes and you're trying to pilot it.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.760]   And of course, there's inertia.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.000]   So you could go in some direction and then you realize how hard it is, actually, to pilot the--
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.400]   I bet it is.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.360]   --a ship.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.560]   In fact, I think really part of the problem is that ship is just too damn big.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.200]   That's really-- that thing is mass.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.320]   It's not the word.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.360]   So actually, there is sub-stack news.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.360]   They're raising $65 million.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.160]   They are probably the king of the paid newsletters.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:37.600]   And there's been-- we've talked on previous episodes about some criticism about sub-stack.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.640]   The so-called sub-stack professionals who get paid and like, well, who is it?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.240]   Because nobody-- a sub-stack won't say.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.360]   Nevertheless, I think sub-stacks-- why did you choose sub-stack?
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.800]   There are lots of choices out there now, including review at Twitter.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.000]   Right.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.440]   I think you probably know that I used to use MailChimp.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:05.200]   MailChimp is just-- has always been really about marketing emails and had become even more so over time.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   And it was pretty complicated to use.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.600]   The thing that I like most about sub-stack, two things I like about it.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.320]   One is that it's super easy to put together a newsletter.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.600]   I mean, it's super easy.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.160]   If you want to reference, for example, a tweet, you just put the link to the tweet in there,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.720]   and it'll show you the whole tweet, the picture, the video, whatever it is.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.040]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.920]   It'll just throw us in there.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.560]   It's the card.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.360]   The heading and all-- you don't have to do your own formatting.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.760]   And it's kind of a standard, right?
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.720]   So everybody's accepted all the standards around sub-stack, one of which is that when I link
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.040]   from social to one of my posts,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.280]   sub-stack does the money-grubbing business for me?
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.000]   It jumps in there and it's like, hey, we don't want to pay for this.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.480]   Do you want to pay for this?
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.960]   And so that has already been accepted.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.880]   If I try to do that kind of stuff on my own, it feels-- it kind of feels like, oh,
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.720]   this guy's always trying to get money from me.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.200]   But because it's a sub-stack standard, everybody's used to it and expects it,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.040]   it goes down a little bit easier.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   So it's little things like that that I like about it.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.920]   It's really-- I don't really don't want a format or a service or any of that stuff to get in the way.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.200]   I just want to get my ideas out there in a clear, friendly way and have everything else managed.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.560]   And they basically do a good job of--
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.280]   It's somebody's--
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.640]   --voking like a true content career.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.400]   It's somebody tenderizing me.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.480]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.840]   This-- we're downtown Oaxaca.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.800]   So there's craftsmen building stuff.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.840]   I think it's a religious holiday.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.760]   I think they're crucifying somebody's well.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   Sorry.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.960]   I don't know.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.000]   And ringing the nail.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I was just looking at review, which is getreview.co, re-viewee.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.520]   This is the new Twitter thing.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.000]   And as you're talking, I'm looking at it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.440]   And they're selling exactly what you just described.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.760]   It seems people choose this stuff for the ease of the CMS, how easy it is to put content in.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.200]   And then I do-- I agree with you.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.760]   You don't want to be shilling all the time.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.280]   Let them do the shilling.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.920]   I want shilling to take place.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.040]   I just want to do it myself.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.600]   Yes.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.640]   And that's how you survive.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.680]   But shilling happens as the bumper sticker says.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.320]   Yes.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:10.480]   Right.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.840]   Let me tease the end of the show, though.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.400]   So later in the show, I'm going to tell everybody an even easier way to publish a newsletter.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.520]   All right.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.960]   And so stick around because it's even easier.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.080]   It's pretty cool.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.240]   Yes.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.200]   I'll be there.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.960]   There also is.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.240]   So that's one big movement, which is the paid newsletter movement.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   And then there's the clubhouse movement.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.400]   And we have multiple stories this week.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.760]   And in fact, I thought Clubhouse had kind of peaked that it was kind of over.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.240]   But there are multiple stories about New-- LinkedIn is going to do a clubhouse.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:48.960]   Spotify bought something called Locker Room, which is a live social media
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.680]   audio app from Betty Labs, which is, by the way, a great name for a company.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.880]   Betty Labs is a great name for a company, but Locker Room is a horrible name for social network.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.800]   People are naked in Locker Room.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.280]   Right.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.480]   I mean, it's like--
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.600]   And the things they say in Locker Rooms are the kind of things you might say before it appears.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.720]   I'd name it the sauna.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.360]   The sauna.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.520]   But that's got to consider the origins.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.520]   It wasn't the origins of Locker Room based on sports.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.960]   But now they're going to go wider.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   So I hope Spotify names it something else.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.480]   This is my rule that now all social networks do everything that all social networks do.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.920]   Oh, yes.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.960]   That's all to the same thing.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.080]   You've mentioned that before.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.480]   Right.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.200]   Right.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.920]   Which is great news for, I think, Twitter.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.680]   I mean, LinkedIn is having one, et cetera.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.800]   Everybody's got a clubhouse clone.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.280]   I think the company that's going to come out worse in all this is Clubhouse itself.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.720]   Because people already like their social networks.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.200]   They're on.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.680]   Think about--
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.000]   Why?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.200]   This is, for example, Twitter spaces.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.040]   Every social network is going to have a clubhouse and a Twitter component roughly,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.280]   right?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.760]   Right.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.800]   Except for clubhouse.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.560]   Clubhouse is the only one that doesn't have a Twitter.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.520]   Twitter has a clubhouse.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.720]   But clubhouse doesn't have a Twitter.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.920]   I'm going to argue with you.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.280]   I disagree with you.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.080]   I think that do one thing and do one thing well.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.560]   And so people will go with the thing that is most native to the platform.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.040]   And in fact, historically, there's some, you know,
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:24.240]   Twitter's created reels to compete with, just as you say, Jeff, to compete with Snapchat and
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.080]   Instagrams stories and fleets and reels.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.520]   Fleets.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.080]   Is that what it is?
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.200]   What's reels?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.600]   That's Instagrams.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.720]   Reels is Instagrams.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.960]   Do you understand my confusion?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.480]   Yep.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.040]   But I think you're going to go to TikTok if you want to do TikTok.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.280]   You're going to go to clubhouse if you want to do clubhouse.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.400]   I feel like people will want to use what's native to the medium.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.720]   Not one social network that does it all.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.000]   Right.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.400]   But there's one issue with that, though.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:59.200]   There are Twitter does something really badly, which is that it has only 280 characters, right?
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.920]   So people want to express anything that's longer than that.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   They do Twitter threads, which is complete failure.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.680]   It's such a bad clue.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   Everybody hates them and nobody follows them.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.400]   Whereas with spaces, I think that if somebody has something important to talk about,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.800]   they want to have a conversation, they can just go directly from a tweet into spaces
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.080]   and have a longer conversation.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.040]   Well, you have the advantage of Twitter being a great promotional medium.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.280]   So it could say, "Yes, just as you do with your sub-stack."
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.840]   You say, "Go to my spaces and talk."
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.320]   Do you think that, because I think Jeff's always been a fan of the thread on Twitter.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.680]   Will you defend threads?
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.160]   Yeah, I will, Mike.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.600]   I mean, it's not even possible anything.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.720]   But what is?
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.280]   What is?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.880]   Yeah, I think it has the advantage too that, well, one thing I've always wanted,
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.200]   Dave Weiner has talked about this for a long time, on his blog,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.640]   every paragraph has a permalink.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.840]   Yes.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.480]   Right?
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.000]   So in essence, this is the same concept.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.840]   He can do that because he designed the platform.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.600]   That was a feature he designed in.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.960]   And it's very good.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:05.440]   So in this sense, a thread means that it's thought in the middle is directly linkable.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.480]   I like that about it.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.960]   I can share just that.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.120]   Sometimes it takes people to get a little
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.760]   engine revving to get to their point, or there's something really neat in the middle,
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.120]   or I want to respond to just that point in the middle.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.840]   So I think that the threaded form conversations were a pain.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.440]   Reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply, reply,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:27.600]   right?
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.520]   We never figured out threading there.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.200]   Twitter hasn't figured out threading in the other way,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.160]   but it added some value to it that has architecturally something that I think does have
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.640]   import for other discussions.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.920]   That's a good point.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.240]   I just think that it's really going to be interesting when Twitter gets spaces in the browser,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.640]   as opposed to just a mobile feature.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.840]   I think that could really kick it in a high gear.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.400]   And I also think they have the capacity to do higher volume than other one.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.000]   But I don't think any of these are going to--
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.920]   I don't think social audio is going to be the main way most people do social media at all.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.360]   So explain spaces to me.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.960]   Is that really worth their effort?
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.520]   Well, it could be.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.400]   So Twitter spaces is basically-- they're rapidly building it out.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.600]   Start it out on iOS only.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.720]   Now it's on Android.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.320]   Essentially, what you do is from the mobile device, if you want to launch a space,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.640]   you basically just hit start a space.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.520]   And then the people who follow you can see from their mobile app only.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.880]   They can't see it from the browser yet.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.760]   All the spaces of the people that they follow.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.520]   And then you can just tap to join it.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.160]   And you do kind of an audience member unless you're promoted to a speaker by--
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.120]   What do you do in there?
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.600]   Right.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.360]   But what I'm saying is they put this on mobile because that's clearly the priority.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.800]   Everybody's walking around with those phones in their hands and they cannot put them down for
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.520]   whatever reason, even if it's just to go to the bathroom.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.760]   So why would they even bother with a browser version of this when mobile is the way to go?
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.440]   Because that's just what people want to do.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:14.000]   Well, I think that there are a ton of people who use Twitter in the browser and they--
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.800]   You know, spaces doesn't even exist in the browser.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.480]   I mean, if you're working and you have Twitter going back and forth to Twitter,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.160]   of course, I'm talking about journalists.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.600]   This is what we do all day.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.080]   We're back and forth between doing our actual work and wasting time on Twitter.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   You know, that's--
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.200]   You need to know who's talking about what on this other medium.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.240]   Because if it's just the phone people, you know, the people who primarily use the phones on Twitter
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.760]   is one kind of group of people.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.880]   And then the people who use a browser or some third party thing or tweet deck or whatever,
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.640]   that's a different type of answer.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.840]   Yeah, but I go back and forth.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.280]   Well, it's sort of a while.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.920]   Is it--
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.480]   That role does it--
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.960]   Yes.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.000]   --but I name it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.960]   Is it--
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.600]   That's it forever or is it just it for the moment that I do it?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:04.880]   It's ephemeral for now, but they've made noises to say that they're going to allow you to record them.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.440]   Essentially--
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.800]   But I'm asking if they've done a podcast.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.440]   That's one of the things--
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.560]   --with Clubhouse.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.640]   One of the things with Clubhouse is it is ephemeral.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.680]   You can't record it.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.480]   So I think there's a certain freedom people feel with Clubhouse.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:22.080]   It's kind of interesting because as a professional broadcaster/podcaster,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.760]   I would get very tired of hosting events on my phone.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.240]   You have to hold it.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.280]   I get tired of listening.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.160]   You hold fart, you--
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.000]   Yeah, but I get very tired.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.160]   Clearly, it's the most convenient, easiest way to do it.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.040]   You've got a microphone there.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.240]   Well, you have a headset on it.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.360]   Yeah, you're ready to go.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.680]   But as you-- and I think this is happening already as people get more
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.320]   serious about it and have regular Clubhouses and stuff, they move to the desktop.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.280]   They find ways to--
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.840]   Yes.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   --you know, do Clubhouses for--
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.760]   So if you started a space right now, Leo, what would happen, Mike?
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.800]   I would see it.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.240]   I would see on my Twitter feed that--
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.880]   If people would follow me, it would see it up at the top there, right?
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.280]   So at the top there, you'd see that-- you know, it's a terrible interface right now.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.640]   And hopefully they'll fix it.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.280]   But you see that there's a space and you see who the host is.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.760]   And by tapping on it, you get the option then to join it or not join it.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.520]   So can we do a space though?
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.040]   We can't, because I don't have spaces.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.520]   So you long press and compose.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.320]   And I don't get the spaces as an option.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.680]   These are reels though, right?
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.120]   These circles at the top--
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.520]   --flakes.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.960]   Put them up there with reels, which is--
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.120]   Please.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.160]   --terrible and safe.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.800]   These are fleets.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.760]   These are fleets.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.800]   These are fleets.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.760]   So these are fleets.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.160]   The past--
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.360]   So hard a simple of fart.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.640]   We know as much about Twitter as we do about ships, right?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.080]   It's a bow.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.360]   Or is it a prow?
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.720]   So where-- so then I see these fleets.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.600]   Where would the-- where would the spaces--
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.160]   It was so idea.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.400]   --you might do.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.000]   --is way up but it'll be a separate--
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.200]   --at the beginning.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.840]   So--
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.880]   --this is now saying, oh, do you want to create one of these?
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.840]   No, I don't.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.320]   So--
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.680]   --okay, got it.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.160]   OK.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.080]   So use the first three icons there.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.160]   Those would be spaces if people--
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.520]   --I see.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.680]   --you follow our app--
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.200]   --of current live spaces.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.520]   And this is-- you're exactly right.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.720]   This is why, as you keep turning these features,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.760]   this is why I say, stick to one thing
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.640]   and become the standard.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.880]   But as you add these features, now you've
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.440]   got to figure out how to jam that in between fleets
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.640]   and tweets.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.840]   And which means they shouldn't, instead of call it spaces,
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.400]   they should call it speeds.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.680]   But that's another--
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.560]   That's another thing for another day.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.720]   I don't know.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.160]   I mean--
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160]   And you said you don't care for marketing.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.240]   If you're going to go with tweets and fleets,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.480]   you might as well do speeds.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.200]   I feel like--
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   But then it becomes spinner.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.640]   --you do a mean two thing.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.800]   It's hard to succeed because it feels like it's
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.840]   a me two thing for one thing.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.520]   But everybody's doing that, exactly.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.240]   Yeah, I know.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.120]   It's pretty cool stuff.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   It's pretty cool stuff.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.040]   Discord just announced-- which is hysterical--
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.520]   that they're going to do clubhouse-like features,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.040]   even though--
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.520]   Yes.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.040]   --as far as I know, Discord really--
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.800]   started this because you could do audio--
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.400]   Discord, right?
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   Isn't that just the same?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.000]   They're calling it stage channels.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.040]   I guess, really, it's additional moderation features.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.400]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.240]   And I think that this is the thing that clubhouse is demonstrated
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.840]   as the power of moderation features.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.920]   So in clubhouse, as a moderator,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.200]   you can invite other moderators who then can promote people.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.320]   And there's a good feature on--
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.000]   And by the way, if you get tired of being a moderator,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.840]   you can hand it off and say, OK, I'm--
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.360]   Exactly.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.160]   --it's a good thing for you to be receiving, which means a room
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.640]   continue on without you having to be the one and only host.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.160]   Right.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.680]   Right.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.560]   They did a lot of things right at clubhouse.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.760]   They actually were very clever.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   They did.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.560]   They absolutely did.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.600]   The thing we learned on Google+,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.000]   because Google+ many years ago had Hangouts, right?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.640]   Back in the day, Hangouts was a feature of Google+
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.040]   where you could have video--
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.760]   And what we learned there is what
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.880]   we're going to learn with social audio.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.960]   There's a minority of people who prefer that medium,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.160]   and they'll form their own little group,
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.280]   and it'll be like two social networks on one.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.240]   So on the Hangouts people on Google+,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.680]   we're like, that was a small group of people.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.760]   It's the same thing with the spaces people.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.120]   The spaces people on Twitter are already
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.320]   this sort of little group that is not fully integrated
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.080]   with the larger Twitter social network.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.840]   And I think that's it forever.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.400]   I'm talking like 5%, 7%, 10% maybe
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.600]   of Twitter users, of LinkedIn users, whatever,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.080]   will use this feature, and everybody else
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.320]   will probably completely ignore it.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.280]   I do think on Discord it might take off,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.240]   because it's essentially something people are already doing.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.160]   But now, in fact, if you look at it,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.480]   it looks just like clubhouse.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   You have the stage with the speakers.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.280]   You have an audience.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.480]   You can raise your hand so that you can say I'd like to speak.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.000]   And look, you can even, instead of leave quietly,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.800]   exit quietly.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.400]   So of course, of course.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   They've really--
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   They've really--
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   I wish goodbye.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Yeah, I believe that.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.560]   When I first started using clubhouse,
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.640]   I was like, leave quietly.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.640]   I don't understand.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.800]   Is there a way to leave noise leak?
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.600]   Can I slam the door on the way out?
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.560]   Can I help with all of you?
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   I'm darned.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.560]   I tell you--
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   You feel like you're kind of--
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.560]   Get to me.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.080]   You're sl-- just like you slide into somebody's DMs,
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.600]   you're sliding out of their clubhouse.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.760]   It's like, oh, okay, bye.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.320]   What is in it for the social media influencers
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.760]   to jump on clubhouse or--
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.360]   I think it's another platform.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.600]   You can build a following on, right?
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   And right now, there's--
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   Right now, there's the way it's working.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.400]   There's a look at some way to monetize those different platforms.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.880]   Oh, there's no monetization right now.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.480]   Right, that's why I see this.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   I didn't realize it.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480]   I mean, I think money.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.920]   I think-- I think the potential ones
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.960]   are just want to build their brands and stuff like that.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.360]   But one of the things we've learned is that really clubhouse--
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   clubhouse is really for the talkers.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   There's some people who just love the sound of their own voice
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.160]   and want to go on and on and on and on.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.480]   So this is one of the--
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.800]   Yes.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.560]   Well, also, there--
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.640]   on spaces too, believe me.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.720]   But this is one of the--
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.040]   so I think that the future people innovate.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.120]   Right now, there's not a whole lot of innovation.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.880]   But I think like a one-on-one-- for example,
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   when the information--
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.840]   when clubhouse a couple of months ago, when the information
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.560]   revealed new details about Apple's upcoming headset
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.120]   or whatever, I grabbed the guy who
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.400]   wrote that thing and I said, let's go to a clubhouse.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.440]   And within a half an hour after that story broke,
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.040]   we were chatting about it on a clubhouse.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.800]   I think that's great.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.160]   And we didn't let anybody else talk.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.120]   That was the key.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.760]   Right.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.520]   It was just me grilling him about his story.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.120]   And then--
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.720]   Not our issue tool.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.320]   We're done.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.400]   30 minutes, we're out.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.760]   A lot of these spaces go on.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   I did a space.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.240]   We had MC Hammer and a bunch of other people on the space.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.080]   And it's like, I couldn't get out of it.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.840]   It was eight hours later.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.640]   I'm still the only thing holding it there as a moderator, right?
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.880]   Because if I leave, the whole thing closes.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.960]   And that's a problem.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.880]   But I think with some innovation and a little bit of vision,
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.680]   I think some people could really use it
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.920]   to build whatever their brand is.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.640]   If somebody was specializing in something or other,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.240]   you get 10 or 20 other people listening to you
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.360]   and have small groups, I think there's a place for that.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.960]   But it's never going to be a mass broadcast medium.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.200]   If I were going to pick a winner, I would say discourse.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.320]   Because, hey, they already have the user base.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.480]   They're already pretty close to that model.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.880]   And you could, for instance, tie it to your Twitch stream
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.040]   where you can monetize.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.560]   I just think this is a smart thing for Discord to do.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.160]   Because they're adding the features that make Clubhouse
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.440]   work to an existing platform that everybody understands.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.200]   In fact, it makes me--
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.760]   So Microsoft buys them and--
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.600]   Yeah, by the way, apparently that's heating up.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.160]   At first, we read about it.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.520]   It was like Discord said, yeah, we talked,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.080]   but we're not talking now.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.520]   Apparently, there is now--
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   The days later.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.880]   I think you're going to hear from Amazon on this.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.520]   Because they run Twitch.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.160]   And I think Discord and Twitch are a very natural partnership.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.240]   And I think Amazon is going to be in the bidding.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.640]   Maybe they'll be too cheap to compete with Microsoft.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.440]   $10 billion is the current amount of money
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.040]   they're banding around.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.080]   I like Discord.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.920]   I really do.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.560]   In a way, I hope Microsoft doesn't buy them.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.600]   And I could see us doing a Clubhouse like on Discord.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.640]   I wouldn't do it on Clubhouse.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.840]   Because it's ephemeral.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.120]   And you have to know when it's going to be at the right time
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   and stuff.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.680]   But I think having a stage and doing an event on Clubhouse
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.080]   would be really naturally--
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.800]   it's kind of like doing this show.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.120]   It'd be a very natural, easy thing to do.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   I presume you can record it.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.400]   If you can't yet, I'm sure you will be able to.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.200]   That's one difference.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.680]   Clubhouse really is trying to be ephemeral.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.480]   You have to be there.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.960]   It's at the time and place, otherwise.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   FOMO.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.600]   Yeah, that's part of it, isn't it?
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.800]   Is the FOMO.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.320]   But I also have used it.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.680]   Half of the stories about it include Jason Calicones
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.920]   and a quarter of them, even the scoble pulls back on.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.480]   Oh, my god.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.920]   That's a sure sign that it's a flop.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.920]   It's like really--
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.560]   That haven't seen the scoble in a long time.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.920]   If they mention Gary Vaynerchuk, Robert Scoble.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   Mark Cuban, throw him in there, too.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.920]   He's got his own--
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.240]   What is it, fireside?
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.480]   It was a great, great thread I had on the rundown,
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.600]   because we didn't do but a guy did this funny rundown
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   on what's going to happen to Clubhouse.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.720]   One of his tweets into thread, which I loved so much,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.840]   I couldn't see Mike.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.680]   I could point to that particular tweet about how much I loved it,
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.040]   was Gary Vaynerchuk found a new place to yell at people.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.520]   And he told 24-year-olds to move back in at home
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.960]   and sell all their parents' stuff on eBay.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.600]   Oh, great.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   I tell you, you're rich.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.320]   That's like soupy sales, right?
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.480]   So baseball cards.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.680]   Well, I got a Gary Vaynerchuk story.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:58.200]   I went to Armenia last year or year before last
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.080]   must have been.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.120]   And there was a local tech conference.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.960]   And I thought, well, I'll just go to this tech conference
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.280]   and see what an Armenian tech conference is like.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.480]   Guess who was speaking there?
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.320]   Oh, my God.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.280]   Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.240]   Gary V, a little later on.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.840]   Edward Snowden's going to join us for an on-stage discussion.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.360]   That's right.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.520]   It's going to be great.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.600]   It's going to be great.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.200]   Well, you know what?
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.680]   This is good.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.240]   This is a sign that the internet has matured.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.880]   We now have D-list celebrities on the internet, too.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.360]   Yes.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:24.880]   So--
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:25.840]   Oh, God.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.360]   Very important.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.280]   I'm probably one of them, as a matter of fact.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.800]   Maybe.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   Maybe.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.300]   Maybe.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:30.800]   Maybe.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   Is D a bit of a promotion for--
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.160]   Well, actually, did you see this funny cameo story?
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.920]   I put it in the rundown.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.800]   Cameo is the pandemic's been very, very good to Cameo.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.480]   Cameo is the place where you go to buy celebrities saying--
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.400]   I know their little messages and stuff, right?
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.320]   But it's mostly-- if you look at the Wall Street Journal
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.560]   as a scrolling list, it's mostly--
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   it's mostly D-list.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.520]   In fact, apparently--
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.400]   Oh, it's Hasbins.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.560]   Cameo knows that.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.360]   Stephen Galanis, quote in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.240]   he's the CEO and co-founder of Cameo,
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.360]   said, my D-list celebrity might be your favorite person
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:11.920]   in the world.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.360]   We're tapping into this.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.600]   The definition of fame--
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   No, it's going to change.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.400]   It's camp.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.160]   It's camp.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.720]   It's the fact that you can get somebody--
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.440]   oh, my god, they've fallen here and even I can--
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.760]   Whatever happened to Scott Rogowski.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.400]   And he can get him to do a little thing for you.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:26.920]   And he--
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.040]   That's the oldest trick in the book
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   is D-list celebrities that are treated
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.240]   as if they're still mainstream.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.360]   Hollywood Squares, Dancing With Stars--
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.320]   Love's True.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.000]   Yeah, Love's Both.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.960]   That's what Love's Both was.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.720]   In fact, in fact, you should have a show, Leo,
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.200]   that brings on D-list celebrities to talk about technology.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.920]   Twid.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.360]   This week in D-listing.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.120]   Carrot tops only $150.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.600]   Get him, just do a personal thing.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.680]   I think that's all he made for.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.240]   I saw a picture.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   I saw a picture.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.760]   Really, too.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.880]   So it's now valued.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.560]   It's a unicorn.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.840]   It's now valued at $1 billion.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.680]   That's the ridiculous.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.640]   Wow.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.760]   I saw a thumbnail of Bo Jackson on there.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.120]   How in the heck is he considering Bo Jackson?
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.320]   Bo Jackson.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.640]   Because Bo knows.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.440]   I mean, one of the greatest athletes of all time.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.000]   No way.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.320]   Oh, so you're saying he should be an A-list?
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.200]   He's not D-list at all.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   Well, they're still telling stories of Bo Jackson.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.560]   No, that's true.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.000]   But see, this is a perfect example.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.160]   To you, he's an A-list.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.960]   He's like this giant.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.520]   And to the mainstream culture, it's like, you know, he's--
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.400]   $400 to get from the mass.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.480]   To get Bo to say something.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.600]   So he's at least more of an A-list than carrot time.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.040]   Three times better than carrot time.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   Three times better than carrot time.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.480]   Tony, it's only 250 bucks.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:49.960]   Wow.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.560]   Apparently, you can get the whole Wu Tang Clan.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:54.960]   Really?
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.880]   They're D-list?
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.000]   No way.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   This is not-- just because you're on Cameo--
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.840]   doesn't mean you're D-list.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.600]   360--
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.440]   That's how it was presented.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.120]   Well, that's what the CEO said.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.160]   But let me go to Cameo and see.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.320]   Let's see.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.800]   Let's see.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   It doesn't say--
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.200]   Here's Gary R. R. Chuck of that.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.680]   Here are your D-list celebrities for the week.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.840]   Here those has been.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.720]   Doesn't say that.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.400]   I mean, look, some of these people-- Sting is not D-list.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.200]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.040]   That's not Sting.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.920]   No, that's not Sting from the police.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.440]   That's Sting the wrestling legend.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.000]   Paula Abdul.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.640]   Well, and some of these, by the way, are donating to charity.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.600]   So let's not diss them too much.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.320]   Some of these--
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.400]   Well, let's go see--
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.600]   Wait a minute, here's a good one.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.280]   Valuable finds under 150.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   This is the bargain basement of Cameo.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.680]   OK, now you're talking.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.720]   Oh, I see Danny Dreo.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.600]   Pay for him.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.640]   Wow.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.720]   To do what?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.560]   To curse you out.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.720]   You motivate your staff to work harder?
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.420]   In Spanish.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.640]   Some of these, I don't know who they are.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.800]   So here's the guy who played for you, man.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.040]   That's-- Gilbert Gottfried is the perfect Cameo.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.480]   Hey!
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.720]   I love Gilbert.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.320]   Happy birthday!
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   Angelettes.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.160]   And your dick.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   Perfect Cameo.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.000]   Brand pressure.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.440]   Perfect Cameo.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.840]   I think when there's a lightning bolt next to it,
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.080]   they're for charity, I think.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.640]   I don't know.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   Was it what it is?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.160]   I can't remember the deal, because I remember Penn Gillette
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.720]   was doing it for charity.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.080]   Oh, no, lightning bolt means 24-hour delivery.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.640]   It means--
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.680]   They ain't got nothing in there.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.160]   They got time.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.640]   They're on call.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.480]   Oh, my god.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.200]   Standing by Zee Lohan.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.840]   There was a whole thing in the Sunday times about celebrities.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.800]   It's a very hard time to be a celebrity,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.000]   because there's no work right now.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.920]   There's no work.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.120]   So they're just hanging out.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.080]   But you got to play it right.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.680]   You can't just-- you don't want to go on Cameo with a lightning
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:50.960]   bolt.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.000]   That's a bad--
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.880]   That's-- I got nothing to do.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.720]   I'll record some of that.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.520]   I'm hoping your value there.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.880]   So it was an interesting article.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.280]   Andrew Dice Clay, John Lovitz.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:24.060]   Yeah, these are-- what does D-L
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.060]   John Lovitz.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.680]   But then Tim Hardaway, he was a great basketballer.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.880]   He's only 70 bucks.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.480]   Oh, there you are.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   Bay Area Warriors.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.200]   Say a little-- Michael Cohen, Sarah Palin.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.680]   Sarah Palin, wow.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.240]   I actually think athletes is an easier designation.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   If you're not currently playing, if you're done,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.160]   if you've retired, your D-list--
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.960]   I mean, actors are still-- people are still
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.840]   trying to get work.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.640]   Maybe they're still doing--
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.440]   They're not retired yet.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.840]   They're just unsuccessful.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.760]   They just can't get-- yeah, they have bad agents or whatever.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.240]   OK.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.160]   This is Benice, to mock for--
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.760]   Really not.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.440]   For a team.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.360]   Really not.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.680]   Do you now-- OK, here we are.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.600]   How many years ago has Google+ killed?
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.240]   It's been a while.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.680]   Well, it was still painful.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.960]   It was still painful death.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.000]   But looking back now, given all the things that
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.240]   have happened over the years, all the other social networks
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.680]   that have tried to take its place,
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.600]   I still think Google+ should have made it.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.920]   It really was a much better spot than anywhere else
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.120]   that's out there, I think.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:33.760]   It did.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   It did.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.840]   Google+ circa 2014 was killer.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.120]   It was shut down for reals in 2019.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.680]   But they continued for a while on--
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.640]   It was a shell of its former self by then.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.760]   So no, it was a really, really cool thing.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.320]   What's not clear is, to what extent
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.840]   was it cool for the same reason in clubhouse is cool,
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.640]   for the same reason that a lot of new-ish social networks--
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.240]   when there's a good social network,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.360]   there's a lot of people who jumped to go to it,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.800]   and the spammers and all the various types of people
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.400]   who can ruin a social network haven't discovered it yet.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.040]   So how much of it was just that part?
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.520]   That's really true.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.120]   I mean, for Android people--
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.680]   I agree, said Hora Woodson Company
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.960]   could bring in all of their venture stars into it.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   And Google didn't really understand celebrity, I don't think.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.040]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.280]   That's what jumps started clubhouse.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:27.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.840]   You had Zuckerberg in there, and Elon Musk in there.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.000]   And that really made a difference that you could go somewhere
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.560]   and listen to it.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.000]   Just also repellent for some people.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   You know, there is a certain something
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.760]   to hear an unexpergated Mark Zuckerberg or an unexpergated
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.360]   Elon Musk.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.320]   Every time I'd go in those, it was a deathly doll, though.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.760]   It wasn't-- you know, you were hoping for fireworks.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.120]   Well, there's a point at which Leo, you
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.640]   were the top user on Twitter.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.640]   Yeah, that was a lot of time.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.720]   But see, this is what happens to social networks.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.480]   It was the same thing with Google+, you know,
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.880]   in the first three or four years, the top people were geeks.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.360]   Yes.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.480]   And then the people who have people--
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.320]   Then Ashton Kutcher showed up.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.800]   That was the three-pointed Twitter.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.320]   Lady Gaga.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.160]   You've never forgiven it, said--
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.480]   I still hold them against them.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.200]   Whenever I see an Ashton Kutcher movie on TV,
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.720]   I flip the channel.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   I don't care.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.520]   You hate him more than anybody besides Bruce Willis.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.960]   He's my de-list celebrity.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.280]   He just phoned you like--
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   I was only married to James II.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.040]   Oh, yes, that's right.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.000]   That's why-- well, he chopped her head off, didn't he?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.280]   Wrong one, but that's what happened.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   OK.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.880]   Let's take a little break, come back with the actual Google
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.360]   news.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.600]   We've got Jeff Jarvis.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.920]   We've got Mike Elgin.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.800]   We've got Ant Pruitt.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   We've got a great panel.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.440]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.880]   Somebody's saying the title of the show
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.120]   should be, and then Ashton Kutcher showed up.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.760]   OK, make it so.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.200]   Our show today brought to you by Linout.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.640]   If you're a geek, and I know most of you are,
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.160]   you probably remember, when Linout started as the place
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:15.320]   to do your hosting for online applications as a service
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   or websites or to store media, just a great cloud server.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.160]   And I remember, boy, I remember what a big deal it was.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.680]   First of all, Linux hosting.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.640]   And then they said all SSD.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.720]   And this was very early on.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.320]   And I was like, wow, this is so cool.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.280]   And I've been using Linout ever since.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.600]   L-I-N-O-D-E-- I am not alone.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.360]   Linout has over 800,000 developers who choose it.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.160]   And I think the reasons are really clear.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.000]   I mean, support is the best.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.360]   They're geeks like us.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.200]   So they care.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.680]   They want to help you.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.360]   They will not tear you or hand you off or say, well, let me
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360]   find out.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.280]   Let me talk to a supervisor.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.240]   They can help you right from get-go.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.280]   And they're there all day long, 24/7, every day of the year.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.120]   And it doesn't matter what your plan size is.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.360]   They will treat you like the customer you are.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.400]   They will take good care of you.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.680]   Manage your complex cloud infrastructure with Linout.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.320]   It believes in cloud computing for all.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.240]   Simplify it.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.840]   Linux virtual machines.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.960]   You can, of course, get dedicated machines as well as
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.400]   shared storage.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.920]   I'm going to give you $100 credit.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.520]   You can use it on S3 compatible object storage
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.560]   or managed Kubernetes.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.000]   You can host your website, build your app, launch it,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.800]   enrich your developer applications, hosted services,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.520]   websites, AI and machine learning workloads, gaming
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.240]   services, CI/CD environments.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.080]   It really is--
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.200]   you're kind of like do everything server in the cloud.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.280]   And you can launch and scale very easily with your virtual
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.120]   machines.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.800]   There are Linout data centers all over the world.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.600]   And the pricing is simple and consistent.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.920]   Doesn't matter which one you're using, choose the data
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.000]   center nearest you.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.840]   It'll be the same price.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.000]   And it is the best price performance on the market easily.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.960]   It's not even close.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.280]   If you want help or tutorials, Linout has a new YouTube
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.520]   channel, youtube.com/linode, where you can get security
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.360]   tips, video tutorials, and a lot more.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.720]   People love Linout.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.160]   Bryce Adams from MediORIC said, from the start, quote,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.040]   "We were looking for a partner, not a provider.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.920]   Some of the large providers see us only as a transaction.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.880]   Linout is the kind of partner that will be with us from the
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.160]   start today and beyond.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.480]   Multiple Stevie Award winner for their sales and customer
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.840]   service, in fact, third year in a row, they've won.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.720]   Simplify your infrastructure.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.680]   Cut your cloud bills in half with Linout's Linux virtual
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.640]   machines.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.920]   Whether you're developing a personal project or managing
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.800]   larger workloads, you deserve simple, affordable,
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.720]   accessible cloud computing solutions.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.800]   They invented it.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.360]   They're still going strong.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.560]   They're still the best out there.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.400]   Now, I mentioned free credit.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   How about $100 in free credit?
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.120]   Just because you're listening to Twig.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:09.280]   All the details at linode.com/twig, l-i-n-o-d-e,
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.320]   linode.com/twig.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.480]   If you're not at your desktop, you do it from your phone.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.560]   Just text Twit to 47, 47, 47.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.480]   That free credit will apply immediately.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.360]   Twit to 47, 47, 47.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.480]   Or go to linode.com/twig and click on the Create Free
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.400]   Account button to get started.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.600]   You know I love Linux.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.760]   And that's why I love Linout.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.640]   But if it runs on Linux, it runs on linode, the best cloud
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.200]   hosting.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.800]   From really nice guys.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.840]   Thank you, linode.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.680]   They're saying how much they like your background
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.480]   like in your Wahaka apartment.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.640]   It really looks cool.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.160]   It's beautiful.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.000]   Yeah, this is a beautiful space.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.080]   Basically, it's like a walled compound.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.160]   So there's a big outdoor area with multiple buildings.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   Oh, no.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.680]   And one of which is a kitchen.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.720]   And this kitchen is just so beautiful.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.640]   You really have the whole digital nomad thing down, man.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.560]   Yeah, it really do.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.400]   And I owe it all to Amira because she goes out and meets
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.080]   all these people, makes all these friends.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.440]   And they're always foodie people.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.280]   So it's all about who you know, I guess, to a certain extent.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.360]   So in this case--
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.640]   When are the gastronomad adventures starting up again?
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.280]   Well, the first one is supposed to be for Provence.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.720]   And we'll see if France can get its act together.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.480]   But Day of the Dead and Wahaka, we're only
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.720]   going to do one Day of the Dead.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.200]   After that, we're never going to do it again.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.800]   What?
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.760]   Oh, now I have the dead.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.120]   Yeah, so that one-- and so far, we
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.520]   have room for one more couple.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.560]   But the three couples that we have
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.120]   are all people who have done multiple experiences.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.560]   So they're all already really good friends of ours.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.600]   How fun.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.280]   Isn't that neat?
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.280]   But that's going to be in October, of course,
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.080]   for Day of the Dead.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.840]   So I would say there's a 50/50 chance we'll do Provence
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.920]   in late June.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.080]   And then after that, Prosecco Hills.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.200]   And then we'll see.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.840]   It'll be opening up, I'm sure.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.440]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.600]   Oh, I love the Day of the Dead.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.240]   That's great.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.480]   Gastronomad.net, if you want to know more.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.000]   Just click the experiences button.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.800]   It's all about food and good times.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.760]   Food, wine, and good times.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.720]   So speaking of this house of a friend of ours,
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.760]   the friend happens to be the biggest chef.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.480]   He's the Enrico Alvera of Wahap.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.200]   He's kidding.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:29.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.320]   No, and he's going to teach an all day cooking class
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.080]   during Day of the Dead, even though he owns four restaurants
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.000]   in town.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.920]   How fun.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.360]   And he's just a rock star of a chef.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.680]   And anyway, it's his friend that hooked us up
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.960]   with this apartment.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.880]   But that's how I'm here is.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.600]   She knows all the foodies everywhere we go.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.240]   You married well, Mike.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:51.680]   I did.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.240]   I did way above myself.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.600]   That's any of us we can hope for.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   We all do.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.440]   Yeah, we all do.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.600]   Is this the room full of overachievers here?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:04.920]   This is a BS story, but I'm going to report on it.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.600]   Research from Professor Douglas Leith of Trinity College
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.840]   at the University of Dublin.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.680]   And the headline I saw everywhere
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:21.000]   says, Apple and Google devices collect data
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.280]   from your phone all the time.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:30.120]   Duh.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.680]   Apple only-- what was--
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.040]   I found a story is from the record.media.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.320]   I don't know what this is.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.040]   And this--
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.520]   Kaitelan Champano found a unique slant on this.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.320]   Google collects 20 times more telemetry
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.960]   from Android devices than Apple from iOS,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   still bogus, still ridiculous.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.720]   That's why it's so accurate.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.960]   Yes.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.800]   Yeah, because well, do you use maps?
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.200]   Do you have location services turned on?
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.560]   Every time you join a cell tower, it has to send out
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   the Mac address and the IMEI.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.160]   And it just-- I'm, of course, it does.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.280]   So Professor Leith, who apparently had no clue
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.320]   that this was happening.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.520]   During the first 10 minutes of startup,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.320]   the Pixel handset sends about one megabyte of data
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:24.400]   to Google with the iPhone sending about 42 kilobits
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.200]   of data to Apple.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.280]   Because Apple already knows more about you.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.720]   I mean, when the handsets are sitting idle,
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.640]   the Pixel sends roughly a megabyte of data
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.760]   to Google every 12 hours compared with the iPhone
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:44.160]   sending 52 kilobits to Apple, kilobytes to Apple.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.120]   And then the headline others reported
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   was iOS and Android shared data on average
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.440]   of every 4 and 1/2 minutes.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.320]   Is there-- am I wrong to dismiss this or is this just--
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.000]   yeah, duh, do you surf the web or using the internet?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.440]   Are you using your phone at all?
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.240]   It's the demonization of data.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   Also, both Google and Apple said this is BS.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.680]   I mean, you would think that Apple would go, yeah.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.120]   See how much better we are.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.600]   But even Apple said, you don't know what you're doing
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.360]   about the research.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.560]   You don't know how all this works.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.520]   When I saw one little tidbit in the story is that, yes,
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.240]   there's a lot more data.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.120]   There's a lot more actual data in terms of the size of the data.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.480]   But they said that Apple actually
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.480]   collects a larger variety of things.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.000]   So there you go.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.080]   So my first thought was, yeah, Apple's really good at streamlining
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   things.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:45.320]   And again, it's really--
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.680]   it's important for people to know what's happening.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.240]   So when you open your settings and you're
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.800]   flipping through your settings, data
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.880]   about what you're doing is being sent back to Apple and/or
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.200]   Google.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.600]   When the phone is just sitting there
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.240]   and has been sitting on the table for an hour,
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.400]   that data is sent back to Apple and Google
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.240]   and says, hey, this phone has been sitting there for an hour.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.800]   Now, there isn't a team of people going, oh my god,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.200]   Jeff Jarvis's phone has been sitting on his table for an hour.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.640]   This is just--
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.040]   they're constantly logging how things work and so on.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.520]   Yeah, I know that's unrealistic.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.280]   You never leave your phone on the table for now.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.400]   Do you have email on your smartphone?
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.120]   Well, guess what?
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.840]   When you open the email and your email's there,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.960]   guess how it got there?
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.480]   It downloaded it from the internet.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.360]   This is-- if you had a smartphone
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.240]   and you could make this go away,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.600]   you just disable your broadband connection
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.880]   and disable your cell connection
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.160]   and no data would be transmitted.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.120]   Or you get a 300-bot modem and you just dial in every time
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.840]   you want to connect and otherwise you won't.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.360]   I mean, it's just--
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.440]   I'm sorry, but that's why we have smartphones
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.920]   is to connect to the network.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.360]   It's a crap story, but I appreciate you bringing this up
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.320]   because people need to know the truth of this matter.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.880]   I just recently had a conversation with someone
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.160]   in the family that got a message about it,
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   a particular app having access to their emails.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.200]   And what-- I'm not going to say what the service was,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.920]   but it needed to have that access
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.520]   because it was just the way that particular app worked.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.600]   Yes, that's how it works.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.800]   And I had to explain to them, look,
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.200]   there's not some kid named Chris sitting here
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.720]   reading every single email that you have.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.880]   Because that's how they perceived it.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.280]   These messages pop up, they perceive it as,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.640]   oh my goodness, the tech world
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.120]   is spying on me.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.400]   And there is a little bit of that, but not like,
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.880]   oh, I saw that you had corned beef hash the other day
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.640]   for dinner.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.840]   It's not good.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.320]   I log everything I eat, every single thing I eat in an app.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.440]   And it gets transmitted.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.520]   Guess what?
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.640]   Professor Leith, it's getting transmitted
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.960]   back to the home office.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.320]   That's how I use it, and that's how I want to use it.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.440]   Anyway, this goes back to moral panic, which is--
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:07.920]   Yes.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.680]   I kind of admit, Jeff, there is a little bit of that going on.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:18.800]   And I really think people really have to think more seriously
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.120]   about what we want technology to do.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.680]   And if you don't want it to do any of those things,
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.160]   that's fine.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.880]   But then don't complain that it's useless.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.600]   If you want to use it, you're going to be sending data back.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.880]   And I don't know if there's a harm to that, frankly.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.640]   But it's a perfect transition to a really interesting story,
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.840]   which is Google's memory.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.960]   And I'm sorry if I'm changing the subject.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.800]   No, please.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.600]   I'm done with it.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.560]   What's Google's memory?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.920]   But Google's testing memory, which
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.880]   is an assistant add-on that's currently
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.080]   being dog-footed within Google.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   But basically, it's a repository associated
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:57.960]   with its assistant where you can just dump everything.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.240]   You can say, here are all my meetings.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.320]   Here's the books I'm reading.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.400]   So this is the opposite of a moral panic about the data
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.480]   that Google's collecting.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.680]   This is where you--
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.400]   Thank you, Google.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   --googled.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.680]   --out of your way to give--
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.160]   and what's interesting about this is they don't use the L
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.800]   word at all.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.120]   They don't say life logging.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.240]   But that's exactly what this is.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.040]   I would do this.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   I would, too.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.520]   And this is a--
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.680]   This is a diary on steroids, right?
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.200]   It's--
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.040]   Yes, exactly.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.880]   Because you're keeping it, but it's also
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.560]   keeping information that--
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.200]   other information.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.720]   We talked about this years and years ago when--
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.880]   Yes.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.960]   Google now.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.120]   Rather than hyper-local, it was hyper-personal.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:34.620]   Right.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.880]   And then it should know your schedule.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.000]   It should know your stuff.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.160]   It should be able to predict things for you.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.520]   I think this is interesting, because it means Google
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.320]   understands that while there are many of us who are upset
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.960]   and say, oh, I don't want--
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.880]   I follow a privacy tool's subreddit.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.240]   Like, these people just want to make sure nobody knows
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.600]   anything about what they're doing, which is fine.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.360]   And you should have the right to do that.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:58.880]   I'll tell you.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.440]   And you do.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.800]   And I don't care about doing anything about something.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.640]   But I personally want stuff like memory.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.880]   I want Google to know more about me.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.840]   So I'm glad-- and I suspect, by the way,
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.800]   I suspect the vast majority of users
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.840]   don't really pay attention to this stuff that this is--
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.640]   the geeks care maybe, or at least they're aware enough
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   to care.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   But the vast majority of users--
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.920]   Isn't this pretty much what the convenience is?
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.720]   Isn't this pretty much the premise of Google now
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.960]   when they brought that out?
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.920]   And I was disappointed, because they kind of--
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.400]   Oh, I was so sad to get rid of that.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.920]   Yeah, they really cut it back.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.560]   They just kill everything.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.400]   This is a new feature for Assistant.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.120]   According to the Verge, a combination of a to-do list,
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.960]   a notes app, a pocket-like reading list,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   a Pinterest collection board, into a single overarching
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.880]   digital locker integrated into the broader Google Assistant
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.200]   app.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.800]   So it's not out yet.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.680]   As you said, Mike, it's being dog-footed at Google.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.120]   Boy, I would--
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.880]   And they also have Google Stack that's somewhere on the run
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.040]   down.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.320]   I put it in there.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.520]   I would like to see Stack combined with memory.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.480]   So Stack is you take your old-fashioned paper--
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.000]   Fizzable papers, right?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.880]   And you put it in there, and it will wisely know
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.360]   where to put it.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.400]   Oh, that's a receipt.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   That's a business card.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:15.960]   That's a this.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.520]   That's a that.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.840]   That's what should work.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.200]   Actually, really, if anything, Google's disappointed us,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.520]   because in theory, if you take a picture with Google Photos,
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:29.480]   it'll know receipts, and it could categorize it.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.400]   It doesn't seem to do as much of it as it could or should do.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.160]   Do you think people are scared--
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.160]   they're scared of the appearance of being overruled?
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   Well, they will be at some point, because somebody--
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:40.640]   On some--
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.520]   Somebody in Congress.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.160]   The reporter will--
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.840]   That's what we may be saying.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.040]   Then they'll next say, how did-- they'll put a story as a--
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.160]   How did it know?
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:49.720]   Memory.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.320]   How did it know?
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   How did it get out?
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.920]   And that makes me sad.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.120]   I would like to--
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.720]   I will acknowledge your right to insist on privacy.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.000]   More power to you.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.480]   But don't let your adamant search for privacy
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.720]   impinge on my interest in giving them more information.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.400]   That should also be possible without Google being cast--
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.760]   It's like vegans picking on me for eating meat.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   Yeah, don't pick on me.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.360]   Yeah, this is exactly how it comes off.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.840]   Yeah, it does.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.960]   Well, the problem for Google, though,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.800]   is that you could categorize people into three camps, right?
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.720]   There's the general public, which
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.880]   doesn't care enough to make any effort to capture
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.120]   this information for their lives.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.800]   There are the privacy advocates who
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:39.480]   are somewhat technology oriented, who oppose it,
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.280]   because it feels like a privacy invasion.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.880]   And then the remainder should be the market for this kind
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.800]   of thing.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.560]   Unfortunately, those people are all too aware of the fact
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.640]   that Google gives up on things and closes them.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.320]   Well, that's true.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.480]   And so you wouldn't want to use them to life log
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.240]   if they're going to give up in a couple of years.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.960]   Personally, I am Charlie Brown.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.000]   I will kick that football again and again,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.520]   as I've done in the past.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.080]   But most people are not like that.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.400]   So I wonder about the market for this.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.000]   Like I thought of you the day, there was a post I wrote
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.680]   some time ago I can't what it was about.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.200]   But the discussion continued on Google+,
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.720]   and I have links to the discussion there,
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.760]   and all of these were saying, of course, it's gone now.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.320]   One thing we have to do as a society--
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.840]   I was working on this for the Gutenberg book--
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.200]   is decide what to remember.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.400]   And there's a great book called--
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.000]   do I have it here?
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.240]   No, that's not it.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.720]   It's a great book called--
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.520]   this is not the end of the book in which Umberto Echo
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.560]   and two other people have a dialogue.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.520]   And Echo says that culture is about deciding
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.760]   what to remember and what to forget.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.360]   Oh, that's good.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.640]   At which novels do we remember, culture decides that.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.120]   And we need that decision about this,
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.000]   because we're losing so much of our current heritage,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.240]   because it's all ephemeral.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.360]   And so what do we choose to keep--
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.560]   not keep with privacy considered, with your own future
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.440]   history considered, with these issues considered.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.520]   But there's such value in recognizing
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.480]   what our lives are about that we're losing this society.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.960]   Exactly.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.720]   The life-logging vision, which is advanced by a whole bunch
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.560]   of people since the '50s, was you would capture everything
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.960]   you read, everything you--
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.240]   Gordon Bell.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:24.800]   You used to--
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.160]   Gordon Bell from Microsoft?
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.640]   Yeah, he used to wear a--
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.320]   and he was then a Microsoft fellow--
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.560]   was to wear a camera around his neck,
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.320]   and would shoot a picture every 10 seconds or so.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.720]   And he had the idea was--
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   and he was inspired, by the way, to do this,
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.440]   because his wife, Gwen Bell, who died of Alzheimer's,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.400]   was forgetting everything.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.960]   And he wanted a way to remember everything.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.240]   And I think that that was inspired.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.360]   The problem is you're exactly right, Mike.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.920]   I'm not Charlie Brown.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.680]   I'm not kicking this football.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.240]   The last thing you want to do is choose
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.320]   any company's repository for this.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.720]   I would look for-- and I think there
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.800]   are good open source solutions that you can store yourself
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.920]   in a format that you can read even if that dies.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.320]   You should be looking for things that you do.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.480]   People in Emacs lovers use org mode.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.120]   There are no taking apps that are very good.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.640]   I really fell in love with Rome at RomeResearch.com.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.160]   But when I realized that it's really
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   hosted on their servers, I started
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.760]   looking for alternatives that are--
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.480]   I host-- I'm using a note-taking app called Obsidian now,
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.240]   which does it mark down, has many of the same features.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.840]   It's really designed for this kind of life-logging,
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.240]   very easy data entry.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.680]   You could put anything into it.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.240]   But you hosted ObsidianMD.com.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.920]   Well, let me tell you about the last--
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.400]   to emphasize your point, the last football I kicked
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.600]   was Google+ itself.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.400]   So we're talking about Google+.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.360]   I actually used Google+ as a life-logging service.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.440]   What I did was with Google+, you could determine
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.920]   the public or private nature of every post.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.560]   And so I was using Google Glass,
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.320]   and I was taking pictures of everything.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.160]   And then I would go through photos and things
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.560]   that I was capturing.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:15.920]   And about 60% of them I kept 100% private.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.120]   I was the only person who could look at them.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.000]   Because they were the kinds of things
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.080]   I wanted to remember in this linear thing.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.600]   Remember, search on Google+ was great.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.840]   So you could search what was that thing two years ago.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.880]   You could search and find it very easily.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.000]   And so I actually used Google+ as a life-logging.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.760]   I think that was fantastic, because there
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.600]   are things you want to have a single stream where some of it
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.800]   is public, some of it is semi-public,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.680]   where it's just family members or whatever.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.240]   And some of it is just private for life-logging.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.760]   You want both the public and the private stuff
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.320]   to be in your life-log, right?
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   Not just the private stuff.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.000]   You want the public and the private stuff.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.320]   And so I thought that was pretty good.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.880]   That was 70% of what I wanted in a life-logging app.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.720]   This is the combination of these two things.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.200]   And who knows if they'll ever combine them?
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.080]   Probably not.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:09.680]   But if they did, Google+ keep versus the stack
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.840]   that Mr. Jarvis brought up a second ago.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.080]   It seems like those two could pretty much
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.080]   be one and the same, right?
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.480]   Yeah, the summary just sounds like keep.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.600]   So this is what I'm using.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.160]   And this is what I would use, which is something that is going
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.200]   to be--
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.440]   this is an open source.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.800]   But the format, it says everything in is marked down.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:31.280]   So you can always use another tool.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.960]   What it does is, which is cool, is the knowledge is a map like this.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.120]   It does internal linking.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.440]   So it's very easy to create a backlink just by putting it
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.000]   in brackets.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.600]   It's just like that.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.920]   This becomes a link.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.520]   I think it's really, really good.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.800]   There are lots of community plugins, very active community.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.480]   It's obsidian.md.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.840]   I've been looking--
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.440]   I've been looking for the right way to do this.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.160]   And I think you need to host the data.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.600]   The data needs to be in a format that
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.640]   can be read even if the app disappears.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.960]   I'd prefer it if it were a closed source.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.760]   I mean, open source.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.280]   But still, it is Windows, Mac, Linux.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.080]   And it's going to go on iOS and Android soon.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:12.920]   This is--
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.720]   I think the opportunity for this sort of thing
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.400]   is in augmented reality.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.240]   So the key is not the capturing of data.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.920]   That's actually relatively easy.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.600]   It's how you look at it.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.000]   Mapping it and all that stuff is a little bit harder.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.800]   And then the ability to quickly recover what you're looking
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.880]   for is the really hard part.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.400]   So I would love to see something like this.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.480]   It's open source that you control the data.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.640]   But which could be conjured up with your eyeglasses
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.840]   while you're walking around.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.480]   Well, you've got to start by recording it.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.320]   I think then it's just a matter of the interface
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.680]   to your glasses.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.240]   But the simple thing that they used
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.000]   to talk about with Google Glass, which is an app that
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.320]   recognizes people and tells you previous interactions.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.680]   And where does it get that information?
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.480]   You both know.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.160]   If you haven't been storing that, it's not going to know.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:01.800]   That's right.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.320]   So maybe Google's memory is a precursor to something
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:05.760]   like that.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.720]   Apples needs to do it.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.200]   They're the ones that are probably
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.160]   going to weigh our glasses before anybody at this point.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.400]   It's also not just for your own stuff.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:17.320]   I mean, watching the tragedy of the George Floyd--
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.080]   there are children trial.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.400]   The last few days have been about the video evidence.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.560]   And it's people thank goodness and bravely
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:34.320]   had the reflex to record and share.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.800]   Otherwise, we wouldn't have this case.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.480]   Otherwise, we'd--
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.840]   Wouldn't it be so different?
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.800]   And you've made that point before that--
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.640]   she posted the video first on Facebook.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:48.200]   And had it not achieved wide notoriety almost instantly,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.120]   we probably never would have heard about it.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.000]   And there'd be no trial going on right now.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.080]   So I agree with you, Jeff.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.640]   This is-- you can't get away with anything now, though.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.600]   There's cameras out everywhere recording everything.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.640]   Yeah, well, that's the other thing today.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.080]   They had on a lieutenant from the police force.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.000]   They have more than 200 cameras around.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.880]   And that's how the dispatcher saw something strange
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.640]   was going on there and tried to call in.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.920]   And they're all these efforts.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.520]   It's phenomenal.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   I know this is not what the show's about.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.120]   But the utter tragedy of the young people
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.400]   who were bystanders or involved, the cashier in the store--
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   They were so--
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.600]   who feel remorse and wish they could have done more
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.480]   and were stopped from doing more is amazing.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:37.680]   But part of what they did was to document, to witness.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.680]   Well--
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.400]   And imagine their frustration.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   What's becoming clear as you watch the trial is
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.520]   they were eyewitnesses to a murder.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.440]   And everybody agrees.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.200]   They knew it.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:49.680]   They knew it.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.360]   Everybody agreed.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.360]   They couldn't stop it.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.320]   There was nothing they could do about it.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.200]   Thank God they were able to record it.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.400]   And now we know they were eyewitnesses to murder.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.920]   I mean, it's just no question about it.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.760]   But otherwise, it would have been--
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.400]   and it's happened so many times before.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.280]   It would have just--
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.640]   Like an element of empathy.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.560]   Well, there is a question about it, sir.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.880]   There is a question about it.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.280]   Like, a question about what?
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.920]   If this was actual murder or not,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.800]   that's why there's a defense for this person.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.280]   Oh, Aunt, you're being very judicious and smart.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:25.880]   You're realistic.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.800]   And journalistic and your writing's accused.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.440]   But I have to say, we all know it was a murder.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:33.960]   Come on.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.440]   Well, the other thing--
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.320]   I mean, to me, one of the most fascinating things
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.640]   that happened last year was that this type of video
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.960]   evidence has changed a longstanding thing.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.360]   Black Americans have been telling everybody
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   for decades.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   And nobody believed him.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   That when they get stopped by the police,
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.080]   it's a whole different ball of wax.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.200]   And I think just about everybody else was kind of like, yeah,
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.840]   you're exaggerating.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.200]   It's probably see blah, blah, blah, blah, et cetera.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.800]   And then all of a sudden, we had access to all this video.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.560]   And everybody was like, oh my god, that's just--
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.520]   because we all then pulled over by the police.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.400]   Everybody's polite.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.200]   It's very nice.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.440]   It's blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:18.920]   And so the ability for these kinds of technologies
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.240]   to offer up empathy for people who live a different experience
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.080]   than you live, no matter who you are--
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.560]   Huge.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.720]   It's enormous.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.320]   It's enormous.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.560]   And that was a--
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.800]   Amun Rana Chatham was pointing out,
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.520]   it started with Rodney King.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.240]   And this goes back to the camcorder, right?
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.440]   Somebody had a camcorder.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.960]   Exactly.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.720]   And we wouldn't have known that story.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.440]   There wouldn't have been riots.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.000]   None of that would have come out if it weren't for that camcorder.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.920]   So we had a new era because of that.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.400]   If you also go to this--
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.960]   there are a lot in Europe and elsewhere.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.160]   There's a presumption of privacy in public.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.600]   If that were a doctrine, then all of the things that were taken
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.680]   would have been-- well, I know it says the perpetrator.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.720]   I don't consent to this.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.800]   I demand my privacy in public.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.840]   Or any one person in a group does.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.480]   That we all own what occurs in the public.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.880]   It is the publics.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.200]   Well, and also what occurs in semi-private.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.720]   I think one of the first cases around this
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   was that some kid years and years ago
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.560]   was arrested for something or other.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.840]   And he was interrogated.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.520]   And when you're in an interrogation situation,
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.000]   the police have the control over whether it's recorded
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.160]   or not recorded.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.240]   So they interrogated this kid.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.400]   They basically tried to blackmail him or did some shady thing
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.760]   to him.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:51.120]   And they went to court and he was looking guilty as sin.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.200]   But it turns out that he had a music player--
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.280]   this is years and years ago.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.840]   He had some MP3 player that had a recording function.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.600]   He recorded the entire interrogation.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.760]   Wow.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.000]   And so they just simply played the recording,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.360]   demonstrating that the police had completely lied
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.920]   and in fact had abused him in the interrogation room
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.080]   in the way that they had claimed.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.360]   The police officer-- he went free.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.960]   The cop went to prison.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.120]   And so this is a case where in a situation where normally one
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.200]   site can control the recording and the other site cannot,
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.200]   he surreptitiously had his own recording that he controlled.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.960]   And the truth was revealed.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.080]   But we're seeing a lot more of that.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.400]   There's still many, many cases where that is not the case.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.760]   Every time there's new technology that can record
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.640]   what's happening, the powers to be, the police, the government,
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.360]   whoever it is, tries to use that new technology
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.560]   to gain an advantage over others.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.320]   And so we have to keep fighting for our right to surveil.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.880]   They're surveillers.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.080]   And it's not going to be easy, but I think a lot more of those
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.280]   fights are coming.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.280]   If you've ever wondered if it's a bad thing or a good thing
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:12.040]   to Google your symptoms, I know it's a bad thing
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.280]   to read about symptoms before you have them,
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.560]   because you will get them then.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.000]   So I'm not talking about that.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:19.560]   It is amazing.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.160]   It is amazing, right?
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.680]   You just never read medical books.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.200]   You will come down with every illness.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.560]   But there's been a study conducted at the Brigham and Women's
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:33.160]   Hospital at Harvard found that people were more likely to
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.600]   accurately diagnose a loved one's sickness after searching
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.880]   for symptoms online.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.320]   Now, admittedly, that's compared to when they didn't know
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320]   research.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:45.800]   Right.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.880]   I think you have sausage finger disease.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.160]   But in other words, the author of the study who is an internist
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.120]   at Brigham and Women's Hospital said,
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.720]   our work suggests it's OK to tell your patients to Google it.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.800]   That's good news.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.160]   As long as they're not also using the internet to get the
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.560]   prescription, you know what I mean?
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.120]   But the other part of it, too, is they found that it did not--
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.920]   the presumption would have been you shouldn't do it, and it
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.160]   will increase your anxiety.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:17.680]   Right.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.200]   It appears it doesn't increase the anxiety.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.560]   Now, the study does say that this was about--
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:26.360]   the hypotheticals, the subjects were given, where someone
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.960]   in your family has these symptoms.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:33.240]   Now, go look up on Google and come back with the diagnosis
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.160]   and see if it's better than the one you just presumed.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:36.880]   It was for you.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.160]   Approach with that.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:38.920]   Yeah, it might be different.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.520]   Like, I got it.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.200]   I know I have it.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.600]   I, of course, I do.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.960]   My mom, she complains.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.640]   Yeah, well, it's--
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.280]   Where is this?
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.040]   Where is Reliable?
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.960]   Is WebMD-- I always go to WebMD.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.480]   I feel like--
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.600]   Oh, that would be--
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   No?
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.520]   No?
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.600]   Really?
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.280]   Where do you go?
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.000]   And if you want to know why you have sausage fingers.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.040]   Well, fortunately, I can pick up this here teleophone
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.720]   and dial a 864 number because I know a physician.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.320]   Call a doctor.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.480]   And said physician is a friend of mine,
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.280]   and said physician has said himself that, yeah, WebMD
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.200]   can be a tool--
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.480]   Oh, that's good to know.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.080]   Yes.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.440]   Mayo, I think, is pretty good.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.240]   Mayo Clinic?
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.000]   Mayo Clinic is good.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.040]   The problem with WebMD is that they will list--
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.400]   first of all, they're super conservative about everything.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.960]   And it's all about directing you to go to a doctor
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.120]   and get an actual evaluation.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:32.720]   For your base.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.560]   But they'll give you literally every single--
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.080]   Possible.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.440]   Possible thing.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.480]   And they don't really do a great job of helping
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.560]   weigh the likelihood of any of those.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.200]   So they give you 30 possible reasons why you have sausage
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.000]   finger, and you're like, well, you're
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.680]   left kind of like--
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.200]   I don't know.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.120]   One of them, right?
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.600]   Yeah, they've been-- they're the original, aren't they?
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.440]   Weren't they?
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.920]   Yeah, they would.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.960]   1998 or '96, they were founded.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:05.120]   So they've been around a long, long time.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.160]   OK, good.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.000]   I'll use Mayo from now on.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.280]   I used to have a book, the Mayo Family Health Book
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   or something like that that was--
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.760]   Remember books before the internet?
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:19.400]   That's like a website made out of trees, right?
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.640]   And a tree, dead tree website.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.440]   They're not going away.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.960]   Even I will admit, they're not going away.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.560]   I can't hit my view.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.280]   I should be updated.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.880]   I was telling my mom about a book that I'd read.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.440]   And I said, oh, you would love this.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.000]   I said, do you still read books?
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:34.680]   Are you kidding?
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.080]   I love books.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.880]   This is-- the one good thing.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.800]   I know I shouldn't use Amazon, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.480]   But I love it that I can go to Amazon.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.640]   And the next day, the book will arrive at her dinner.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.880]   I just think that's really--
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.240]   The other thing I got to tell you--
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.680]   another alternative that I love is Blackwell's.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.200]   I should start--
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.240]   British publisher.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.200]   And you can get books that are out in Britain
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.640]   before here.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.600]   And they discount them like Amazon and free shipping, too.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.560]   It's competitive with Amazon, even for books that
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.640]   aren't released here yet.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.240]   So let me give you a book pornography story.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.040]   Wait, no.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:09.880]   Not pornography books.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.920]   Well, representative Gates, I'm not
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.880]   sure we want to hear this.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.200]   Hey, she was 18.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.320]   Listen, of course, I love love love,
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.920]   actual physical paper books.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.760]   Love them.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.960]   But I can't own them because I travel so much.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   So I have a Kindle--
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.680]   I have a shelf.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.880]   --electronic books and so on.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.680]   Exactly.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.320]   So I loaded up my Kindle before this trip.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.160]   We rolled on into this house, went into the bedroom,
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.720]   and lo and behold, the bedroom is an effing library
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.400]   of physical books.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.160]   Because the guy who owns this house
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.600]   had a bookstore in Oaxaca, an English language bookstore.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.080]   Wow.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.480]   And because of the dispute with the person
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.200]   who was leasing the space from, he closed the bookstore
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.800]   and moved all the books into his bedroom.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.400]   So you actually have a bookstore in that house?
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.040]   There's a bookstore in the bedroom where I'm sleeping.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.040]   And it's all like history of Mexico.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.640]   It's like food, you know, walking place.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.800]   This place, you're standing.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.440]   I mean, it looks so cool.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:12.960]   Wow.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   Now I like it even more.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.040]   It's beautiful.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.680]   Hey, you want to see the kitchen?
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.280]   Let's check this out.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.640]   Let's see.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.200]   Oh, man.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200]   It's making me hungry.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.160]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.080]   It's like the tile above the stove.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.600]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.400]   And all the art on the walls.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.640]   It's really beautiful.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.920]   And so anyway, I was so through.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.520]   I'm like, I haven't even seen my Kindle since the day we got here.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.200]   And I've been just like going through these books.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.520]   And it's just heaven.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.600]   They smell good, too.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.440]   They have a kind of musty, fussy smell on it.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.280]   There's an academic paper I downloaded
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.960]   that analyzed the smell of books.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.560]   What is it?
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.560]   Don't tell me.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.320]   It's bad.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.480]   Well, it's boring.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.440]   It's a whole bunch of chemicals and stuff.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.760]   But the combination of the paper
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.000]   and a little bit of mold and the dust and the leather
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.440]   and the wooden shells.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.280]   It's a nice smell.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.600]   How all I am up.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.360]   I guess it's the associations rather than the actual smell.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.400]   It's the associations.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.880]   Yeah, you never liked reading books.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.680]   I just never could get into it for pleasure
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.720]   and barely read when I had to for school.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.600]   I absolutely hated it.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.680]   I feel bad for you.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.040]   Now I know you don't like chemistry.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.640]   No, but don't get me wrong.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.240]   Because you blew my place up.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.320]   And you have what was it?
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.760]   You've been looking at the Twit community.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.000]   They're Twit for us.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.160]   And explain why he's not a fan of science.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.480]   It was great.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.080]   Oh.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.600]   But yeah, I did enjoy and do enjoy
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.040]   reading instructional books.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.000]   If how to do so and so.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.680]   I'll read that in a minute for some reason.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.440]   But I never quite got into reading for just leisure.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.200]   But I feel bad for you.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.640]   I'm glad to have audible and audio books now.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.320]   Oh, OK.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:55.840]   I'm hooked on that.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.640]   So you do look OK.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.360]   Picking up the book.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.400]   I don't care to do that.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.160]   No, that's fine.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.520]   I can't read anymore because my eyesight's not that good.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.760]   And as soon as I open the book, I fall asleep on the page.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.160]   But yeah, there's that.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.880]   But audio books, man, I just love them.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.440]   I love them.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.120]   Although I've been doing more Kindle of late, I have to say.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.960]   Google and T-Mobile, I saw this yesterday on all about Android.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.720]   Google and T-Mobile announcing a big partnership.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.000]   The carrier has agreed to showcase
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.040]   a suite of Google services on Android phones they sell,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.920]   including-- and this is what's really interesting--
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.840]   Android messages.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.560]   It will now be the default message app on all T-Mobile phones.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.800]   They're also-- they've given up on their TV service, which
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.440]   they've been slowly phasing at anyway,
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.640]   in favor of YouTube TV.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.240]   Google 1 will now be the default backup service
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.600]   on T-Mobile Android phones.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.520]   And they're going to start selling the Pixel, which
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.240]   is very good news because honestly, one of the reasons
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.680]   a Pixel has become less and less interesting
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.120]   is because nobody was selling it except Google.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.800]   I think having it in a carrier store
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.680]   makes a huge difference.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.440]   And motivation came about that.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.640]   I remember reading that and was thinking, hey, that's great news.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.920]   But then I thought people still don't want to buy it,
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.000]   because they don't really have a compelling reason.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.400]   It's not the hotness that be Samsung.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.120]   I think so.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.480]   People go into the--
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.440]   If it's not in the phone store, it's at a site out of mind.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.560]   So I agree with you.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.240]   And so--
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.120]   And it's your geek.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.880]   To some degree, it also depends on the people in the store
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.760]   saying, oh, you should look at this.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.880]   Because most people go on the phone store.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.600]   And they don't have-- in mind, you and I might say,
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.800]   I want to see Samsung Galaxy S21, please.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.840]   But I think a lot of them go, OK, I don't know.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.280]   What should I get?
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.840]   So I think having the Pixel in there is--
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.720]   I remember the Pixel.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.600]   The last time I went to a physical phone store,
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.440]   and it was I was going to get the Pixel 2 XL.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.920]   And I remember walking in the store,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.640]   and they had that hole, you need to make an appointment
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.840]   bull crap going on.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.520]   I'm like, I just want to give you something--
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.320]   --about my business.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.760]   What's that as mean?
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   You know?
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.280]   I'm like, I just want to give you money
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.440]   and go on about my business.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.000]   So I waited 10 minutes, and then somebody came to see me,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.040]   and I said, I want to get a new phone.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.880]   And the first thing got their mouth is, hey, we got the new note.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.800]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.040]   Didn't even think about the Pixel that was right there next to it.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.560]   It's--
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.040]   You know?
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.200]   And I knew I was curious to see what was going to happen.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.280]   But I knew I was there to get the Pixel 2 XL.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.880]   But I was just curious to see what was going to be said.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.360]   If you are a YouTube TV subscriber, as I am,
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.680]   Lisa saw the bill the other day, and she said, what's this $65?
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.400]   Yeah, that's what it costs now.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.880]   She said, let's cancel that till football season.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.400]   But--
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.160]   That's what I did.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:57.600]   You will get 10.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.320]   Don't you have cable?
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.240]   Yeah, I have cable.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.080]   But the reason we have it is because Lisa
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.720]   wants to come to work and watch the football game.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.680]   Ah.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.000]   And you can use the DVR and stuff.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.160]   Honestly, the more I use it, the more likely I am
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.040]   to cancel my cable, because I think it's as good as cable.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.160]   $10 off of your T-Mobile customer.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.040]   The other thing that makes this interesting news
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.200]   is the fact that Android Messenger will
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.200]   be the default messenger.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.120]   And now that means RCS.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:26.720]   RCS.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.240]   Yes.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.760]   The rich communication services will be finally, at least widely
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.320]   used among T-Mobile customers.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.840]   It might be-- I hope it's just enough to get RCS over the top.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.160]   RCS gives Android users kind of a parody
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.560]   with Apple's messages.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.120]   The problem with Apple messages is it's only on Apple devices.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.880]   I guess that's why people turn to what's
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.720]   to happen and the like.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.480]   I wish we had a--
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.000]   That's why hard-head left Android and went to iPhone.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.800]   Yeah, because his friends had iPhones.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.120]   And he didn't like being a green bubble.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   That's it?
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.800]   That is the most genius bit of dark patterns designed.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:07.400]   Yes.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.760]   Because for a long time, I had an Android phone.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.680]   And I had the dreaded green stigmatization.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.840]   And it's awful.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.360]   It really motivates you to want to get an iPhone.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.120]   And speaking of the Pixel, there's
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.040]   one feature of the Pixel that I had to keep my Pixel for,
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.400]   even though I moved to iPhone about a year ago.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.280]   And that is the ability for it to take photos when people
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.360]   smile and all that kind of stuff that's built in the AI that--
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.200]   Oh, it is.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.000]   --it decides.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.440]   Because when we do experiences, we do various things.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.080]   I'm involved.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:43.800]   I'm doing it.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.400]   So I'll just mount the phone with a tripod somewhere
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.960]   and just leave it there for three hours.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.920]   You were in studio more than a year ago, obviously.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.520]   Yes.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:52.480]   And you did that.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:52.840]   Very cool.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.360]   Very first time in Twitch studios on the big show.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.520]   Mr. Algom was there.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.480]   And that's the ability to put that camera.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.840]   It was so cool.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:04.560]   It's so easy and is so high quality that--
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.080]   So a lot of times I'm hanging out with people
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.800]   who are--
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.600]   they don't smile that often, right?
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.120]   And so it's like magical to set up a thing,
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.720]   hang out with a bunch of people for three hours,
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.320]   and that person who never smiles, you get like 20 pictures
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.080]   of them smiling.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:20.680]   Isn't that great?
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:21.840]   It's so great.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.920]   It's so great.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.760]   But that's fine though, Mr. Algom.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.800]   We can't let Google do that.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.640]   Google, those are your smiling.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.240]   I still have to--
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.560]   I still have to go back.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.920]   Because I use Hangouts still.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.680]   I know this is-- I'm hanging by a thread.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.600]   Because I want--
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.760]   You're hanging out by a thread.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.000]   Because it works on Android and iOS.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   So it is a cross-platform messaging.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.800]   So I have-- on my Pixel Hangouts is my default text
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.680]   messaging.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.440]   But I know it's just a matter of time.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.560]   And then I guess I'll have to use Android messages.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.560]   But then I don't know what I'm going to do on iOS.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.080]   So there needs--
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.040]   It's a telegram.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.440]   Well, I love telegram.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.040]   But nobody in my family uses it.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.520]   And I don't think you can make telegram your default SMS
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.000]   program.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   I should look.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.520]   I haven't checked in a while.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.200]   And this, I don't know who's responsible for this.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.280]   Is it Google?
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.600]   Is it telegram?
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.720]   But when you look at your default apps,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.760]   let me just go to my default apps
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.280]   and see what choices I have for messages.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.440]   Yeah, it signals in there.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.280]   But not telling.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.320]   You know, I don't know why.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.680]   Signal is a perfect example.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.280]   Signal is fantastic.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.880]   And again, if you use it, nobody else you know uses it.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.720]   So there you are by yourself using Signal.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.960]   It's pointless.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.480]   But this is one of the frustrating things
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.880]   about Google that's probably secondary only to the fact
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.160]   that they close everything once you've invested in it.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.200]   They are the perfect company to have the universal messaging
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.080]   platform that everybody uses.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.520]   If Google said, you know what?
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.880]   We're going to use Google Messenger.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.440]   And there's only one thing that this company makes
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.880]   that lets you communicate via all these different ways.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.640]   And we're going to support it forever.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.000]   And it's going to have every feature.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.520]   It's going to be like WeChat or WhatsApp or whatever.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.200]   It's going to have all the features.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.160]   And it's going to be on all the platforms.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.400]   Everyone would use it.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.480]   But no, they have all these different platforms.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.480]   Nobody knows what's going on with Hangouts.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.560]   Nobody--
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.560]   --the ones frustrating.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.480]   --believes that they're going to stick with any one thing.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.920]   I did an article maybe two years ago about--
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.720]   I think they had 13 communications platforms.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.120]   And by the time the article was published,
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.440]   they had a different number.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.320]   I mean, it was just-- they're always changing.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.840]   Nobody knows what's going on.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.680]   Nobody even-- even geeks, even the people who
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.360]   listened to this show or even people who appear on this show
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   couldn't literally name all of their messaging platforms
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.520]   and where they are and what they do and all that kind of stuff.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.880]   Nobody knows.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.760]   It's such a lost opportunity for Google.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.640]   You're saying this.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.720]   I would assume that the leadership at Google
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.920]   would know those same facts.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.840]   They would know that, hey, we got this--
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.840]   Yeah, so what story?
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.240]   --allowing we had this messaging.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.920]   We had blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.000]   Why aren't they as leaders saying, you know what?
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.280]   We need to fix our crap and get things more focused
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.640]   to where we can offer a product to the masses that
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.160]   could be strong and used by everybody pretty regularly
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.760]   and just keep it rolling.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.440]   Why isn't--
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.000]   You-- you--
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.760]   Pachai--
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.920]   I know the real--
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.280]   jumping in.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.360]   You said it.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.240]   You said the P word.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.640]   Nobody says this, and I'm the only one who says this,
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.560]   but Sundar Pachai is a horrible CEO.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.120]   He has zero vision.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.400]   And basically, Google's Lord of the Flies.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.200]   Everybody in Google is doing their own thing,
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.800]   and there's no visionary leadership to get everybody
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.800]   in lockstep.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.800]   This is the beauty of Apple.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.920]   The tone was set by Steve Jobs.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.360]   This is why Apple has one thing.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.920]   You know what Apple's messaging platform is?
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.320]   Everybody knows what it is.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.240]   There's one thing you know they're never going to abandon it.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.520]   And Google is the opposite of that.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.040]   Every different division and group and so on
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.720]   has their own thing going on.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.360]   And Sundar Pachai doesn't have the leadership
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.400]   to bring it all into one.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:28.120]   And so it's a mess, and it's probably going to remain that way.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.000]   And maybe it's because the shareholders are like,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:31.560]   we care less.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.000]   Our money is coming from elsewhere,
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.960]   not because of these apps.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.800]   Is that the case?
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.040]   Because there's no real push there.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.440]   Is it--
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:39.960]   I don't know.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.040]   I mean, if everybody wants to be WeChat, right?
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.680]   In China, right?
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.880]   WeChat, that's the Chinese--
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:49.720]   --overwhelming.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.720]   In China, you can't take the train.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.760]   You can't do anything without WeChat.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.840]   This is the wet dream of every Silicon Valley executive
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.960]   because it's an e-commerce platform.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.560]   It's a social network.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.480]   It's also everything.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.320]   You become the default when the government
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.640]   decides you're the default, too.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.680]   So it's like the--
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.440]   Absolutely.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.200]   Yes.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.320]   No, absolutely.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.160]   But the company that Facebook--
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.480]   Facebook's entire thing about buying and integrating
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.400]   the messaging for Instagram and Facebook messenger
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.920]   and all these different platforms into one unit
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.200]   is because their goal is to become the WeChat
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.280]   of the non-Chinese world.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.720]   But really, imagine if Google had that golf.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.800]   Google had the goal of having a single platform
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.080]   that everybody used for everything.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.200]   That would be extremely lucrative for Google as a company.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.720]   They just don't have the culture that would make that happen.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.680]   That's the problem, or the leadership,
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.000]   or the vision, or anything else.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.320]   I mean, I actually think that if the founders--
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.240]   if Larry and Sergey came back to Google
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.720]   and actually ran the company again,
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.800]   I think they could make it happen if they intended to.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.760]   But they're off playing with their money and--
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.080]   Well, see, I don't even know about that, Mr. Elkin,
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:07.600]   because while they were there, this problem existed.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.840]   It was only gotten worse, though.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.560]   You'd think when they handed over the range to Pichai,
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.160]   he could have said, let's fix this.
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.840]   But you're right, it's only gotten worse.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.920]   Is it-- I'm not trying to--
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.200]   We blame Ruth Porat.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.440]   I know where you're going to say.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.680]   We blame the CFO.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.200]   But she works for him.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.040]   She works for him, yeah.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.080]   So I don't think that's fair.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.240]   I'm sure-- you know, I've never heard anybody say this.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.320]   Mike, but as soon as you say it, I have to say, yeah,
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.480]   you're right.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.320]   Yep.
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:39.760]   You're right?
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.880]   This is why Steve Jobs' most successful technology
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.320]   leader--
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.520]   I'll give you an example, though.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.920]   Because he was a fascist.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:54.360]   There was one company where the founder's gone,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.800]   and they brought in a new CEO about five years ago,
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.160]   and he has completely changed the company.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.240]   Don't tell me you're going to say it.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.560]   Don't you're not going to say it.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.000]   Della.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.080]   Yeah, now Microsoft.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.040]   Della.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.200]   Och.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.600]   Yeah, Och, because that company is totally different
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.760]   since he's been in place.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.280]   And it's the company.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.480]   OK, but the reason is that Steve--
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.920]   It's the company that is following the earner overboard.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:15.760]   Was terrible.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.240]   But Bill Gates was the Steve Jobs.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.520]   He was just as ruthless and horrible.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.680]   But Bill Gates never invented anything himself.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.080]   He only copied others and made it more successful,
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:25.960]   which was good business.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.560]   Well, I admit, he was a different person,
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.680]   but he was a cut-through-a-manager.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.320]   He was a cut-through-a-manager, and did very well
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:32.800]   for the company.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.640]   Bomber was terrible, everybody knows.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.400]   And now the problem I have with Microsoft
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.960]   is that they are--
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.840]   as I've said on the last three shows,
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.240]   they're the Eddie Haskell of tech companies.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.400]   Google it if you're too young.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:51.280]   And they're throwing the internet overboard.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:51.800]   Right?
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:52.480]   Well, that's--
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.320]   I'm with the Rock in Australia.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.720]   They're saying redo 230.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.360]   They're signing with the newspapers
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.800]   against Google and Facebook.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.680]   They're the jerk company.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.360]   And they've always been the jerk company,
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.320]   and they're still the jerk company.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.440]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.840]   At least in that regard, they're not impressive.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.000]   But I have to say, in every other regard,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.680]   what Nadella has done with Microsoft
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.880]   is spot-on and his vision--
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.520]   Skype!
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.440]   Skype!
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.960]   And while Skype's-- but he's going to fold Skype
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.040]   into team Skype is going away.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.160]   Yeah, he's got his foot on the throat of Skype right now.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.760]   He could have been Zoom.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.160]   Like now they're focusing on team and Azure
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.560]   and all the other enterprise--
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.560]   Teams maybe could have been Zoom.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   --and stuff that's making them money.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.560]   Yeah, well, that's their future.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.040]   That's where they're going.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:34.560]   That's also their skill set.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.040]   That's also their skill set.
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.280]   Yeah, it's their skill set.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.320]   There are, I think, of all the companies out there,
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.920]   even better than Google, who really
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.600]   should understand this, realize that the future's
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.800]   in the cloud.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.840]   And they are really positioning themselves
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.800]   to be the cloud backbone for business.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.000]   Amazon's-- Amazon's--
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.480]   And Microsoft doesn't compete at that level.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.880]   But on the other hand, Microsoft is more trusted
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.400]   in enterprise than Amazon is.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.560]   In fact, just as an example we talked about this earlier
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:08.720]   on Windows Weekly, they just did a deal that
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.360]   will be $13 billion to sell HoloLens headsets
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.560]   to the United States Army.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.920]   Selling 120,000 HoloLens is to the US Army.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.680]   I think Microsoft knows what they're doing.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.480]   And I think he's an example of a non-founder
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:29.200]   leader who, in fact, improves the company.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.240]   But there are few and far between.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240]   He proves the wrong--
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240]   Yeah, he had a pretty easy action.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.000]   --to follow in the bomber.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.400]   Yeah, he couldn't do worse in the bomber, yeah.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.600]   He accepted the fact that Microsoft is not
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.320]   going to be the sexy company out there.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.400]   They're just going to go out here and make this money
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.840]   on the enterprise side of things and be happy with it.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.720]   Life all to the bank.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.440]   Yes, Mrs. Cleaver, I believe that Wally Google is making
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.200]   the mission take.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.040]   And we're going to be much better than Wally.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.360]   The beaver--
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:00.920]   I didn't--
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.720]   Edward Clark has called him--
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.080]   --the fictional character on Leave It To Beaver television
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.200]   situation comedy.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.960]   Yes, I had to look that up, Mr.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   Jarvis.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.680]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:14.520]   You never saw Leave It To Beaver in?
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   I saw Leave It To Beaver in passing,
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.160]   because quite frankly, nobody in my household
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.360]   was interested in watching that television show.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.120]   I could imagine, yes.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.600]   It was kind of way.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   Right.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.200]   It was the ultimate.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.480]   What did you watch as a kid?
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.680]   Was there TV that you watched as a kid like sitcoms or--
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.640]   Yeah, good times.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   Number one.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   Oh, come on.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.640]   That's such a stereotype.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.080]   You would only watch black shows?
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.120]   It-- well, hey, it facts are the facts, sir.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:44.720]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.240]   I'm curious.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.200]   You watched good times.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.240]   We watched good times.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.000]   We watched "The Jefferson's."
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.760]   We watched "Samford and Sun."
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.800]   Because you watched things that you could relate to.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.080]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.720]   Well, you certainly can't relate to it.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.240]   I watched the beavers home in white suburbia.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.280]   I mean, they couldn't be wider.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:01.760]   So--
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.600]   But those are different areas.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.240]   But those are different eras completely.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240]   I mean, you're talking about what's
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:14.040]   the guy who did "The Jefferson's" and "All the Family," the TV
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.480]   vision you're going to have?
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.280]   Norman Lear has changed all that.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.320]   So you're talking about pre and post-Norman Lear,
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.680]   which is a different world.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:25.160]   But I also have to say that the genius of good times,
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.800]   "The Jefferson's" and "Samford and Sun's" is they got--
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.920]   Everybody watching those.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.720]   I was watching those as well.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.040]   And so that was the beauty of that era.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.600]   I also watched "Mr. Ed" when it came on.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.640]   Ah, there you go.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.600]   Oh, no, there you lost all your credit.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.040]   Because the host did all the way to the one.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.560]   Mr. Ed's neither white nor black.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.160]   It's a horse.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:47.720]   It's equine.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.240]   It's a horse.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.240]   It's the heck one.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.480]   It's the equine inside of the--
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.680]   That's pretty funny.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.880]   And Wilbur's-- clearly, that was not real world anywhere.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.400]   That'd be like watching "Gilligan's Island."
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   It was not related to anything in the real world.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.360]   But Donna Reed and "Leave It To Beaver,"
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.520]   they pretended Aussie and Harriet.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.400]   They pretended to be real America, the real life.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.160]   I'm going to see it because these boys won't know this.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.760]   But Dolby Gillis.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.360]   Yeah, I'm a little too young to be a Dolby Gillis guy, actually.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.320]   I have "Gilligan."
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.160]   I love that.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:21.760]   It was "Gilligan."
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.680]   It was pre-Gilligan.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.480]   He was a beatneck.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.040]   Work.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.040]   Yeah, I just--
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.600]   We're only a couple of years apart.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.720]   But sometimes you really can tell people's age cohorts
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.520]   by the TV shows they watched and the music they listen to.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.120]   And even a couple of years can make a big difference.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.320]   I just missed "Howdy Duty" and "Dobie Gillis" and stuff.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.400]   By "Inchiness."
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.440]   You know what's one of the coolest, most satisfying,
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.880]   and under-appreciated genres, for lack of a better term,
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:56.440]   are reaction videos on YouTube where young people look
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.080]   at old people media and discover it for the first time.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.040]   It's actually really fun to watch.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.800]   I think that would be funny.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.720]   It's not as good as babies eating lemons, but it's OK.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.120]   No, but there are these like 20-year-olds
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.600]   who are watching "Queen" for the first time.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   And like crying because it's so good.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:16.560]   Oh, interesting.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.880]   It's very satisfying.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.480]   It's very satisfying to watch.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.360]   And some of the people just go--
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:21.840]   You don't think it's--
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.800]   Go to YouTube and say it a minute.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.440]   Come on.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.800]   You don't think they're aiming at you.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.640]   They are absolutely aiming.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.920]   You don't think--
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.240]   OK, pretend you're crying.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.040]   Pretend it's like the best music you've ever heard.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.800]   Well, no, no, no, baby boomers.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.080]   I love it.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.120]   I think a lot of it is--
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.080]   I think a lot of it is.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:40.960]   Yes.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.880]   And there's a lot of pandering in terms
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.400]   of the type of content that's viewed.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.240]   For example, a lot of the international stuff
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.800]   is like foreigners looking at American stuff
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.080]   the first time, right?
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.720]   And American audiences are so large in number
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.280]   and they're pandering.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.440]   A lot of British reaction video people
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.120]   are looking at American content,
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.160]   the rules of football, which they don't understand,
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.280]   all this kind of stuff.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.800]   And you would love this.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.560]   Go look at the office blokes.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.880]   It's three English guys.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.640]   And look at some of their football videos
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.200]   where they're like the hardest tackles in football
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.160]   and all this.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.280]   They're watching YouTube videos.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.600]   And they're reacting to it.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.520]   And you see them scratching their heads.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.840]   They're like, what are the rules of football?
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.800]   I don't understand.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.320]   Why are they--
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.640]   I bet that is entertaining.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.840]   It's so much fun.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.160]   It really is fun.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.480]   By the way, "Good Times" is coming back
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.440]   as an animated series on Netflix.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.560]   I just want you to know.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.400]   I just see you.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:34.760]   Wow.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.960]   You'll be rich for that.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.240]   John Amos asked her, "Roulley."
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.240]   That was a spin-off of "Maud," which is a spin-off
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.040]   of all of the family.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.320]   And the Jefferson's was as well.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.040]   Also spin-off.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:47.400]   That's right.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.200]   They were their neighbors.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.120]   They were down the street.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:55.600]   My favorite part is in moral--
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.640]   chain.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.080]   Well, my favorite episodes of "All in the Family"
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.120]   were when-- because George Jefferson was also a racist.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.440]   And he would conspire with Archie Bunker
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.600]   to keep the Puerto Ricans out.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.000]   You're so good.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.360]   You're so good.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.240]   I was watching the QAnon documentary.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.720]   This sounds like I'm going far-field.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.240]   I'm not.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.880]   So on HBO, it's a four-part thing.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.600]   It's fascinating.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.720]   Who is Q, basically?
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.640]   Try to figure out.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.080]   But they'd interview some QAnon people.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.520]   And one guy says, hey, I'm an Archie Bunker.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.400]   Archie Bunker made it OK to be a racist.
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.760]   And I thought, dude, you completely missed the place.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.920]   You missed the point.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:37.760]   That's serious.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.280]   Oh, man.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.760]   You are such an idiot.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:45.200]   You thought it was giving you permission to call people
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:45.760]   s--
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   [BLEEP]
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.680]   No.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:49.200]   That was--
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.320]   Bless his heart.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.400]   Bless his heart.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.320]   Bless his heart.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.280]   That's exactly right.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:58.000]   Jimmy Walker, "Dyno Might" came from good times.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.800]   Yep.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.200]   Quite controversial.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.160]   Really, "Dyno Might"?
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:03.680]   Yep.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.280]   That's controversial about it.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.080]   That's why Mr. Amos wasn't sticking around.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.520]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.720]   He liked "Dyno Might"?
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:15.040]   Yeah, because Amos isn't an actor.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.800]   Jimmy Walker is a comedian.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.320]   Yes.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.360]   It was quite a accidental, right?
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.680]   I mean, there's the stick--
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.800]   He wasn't supposed to be the center of the show, right?
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.800]   Correct.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.640]   Oh, and he didn't like it that it was getting--
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.720]   maybe a little shucking jive kind of too, right?
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.240]   Exactly.
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.240]   There's actually a lot of interviews of that whole cast
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.640]   about how they didn't know each other.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.200]   They didn't like each other.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.600]   There's a lot of conflict.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.720]   I didn't know that Luke Gossett Jr. was in it.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:41.560]   I didn't know that.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.560]   He got one of his early--
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:47.400]   he was Florida's brother Wilbert.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.360]   Early?
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   Early?
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.360]   Yes, sir.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.840]   See, what fast it is, Luke, about all this is that--
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:53.840]   Yeah, look at that outfit.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.640]   I like the belt on the sweater.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.160]   The belt.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.160]   I think all sweaters that belt.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.960]   Holy cow.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.360]   That's so 70s, man.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.280]   It is so 70s.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.360]   So the sitcom is the genre that is native to television.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.560]   Yes.
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:09.960]   Right?
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:12.880]   It has not aged well.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.720]   Well, except now you have Silicon Valley,
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.320]   you have these mobile--
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:16.840]   Are those--
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.240]   I guess they're still sitcoms.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.400]   They don't have laugh tracks.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.040]   So one of the reasons I thought that is--
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.080]   I don't know if you saw this, but there was a--
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.200]   Disney Plus, there was a show very, very popular
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.760]   called "WandaVision," which is another Marvel cinematic
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:29.880]   universe show.
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.920]   Yeah, a lot of people loved it.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.720]   I never saw it.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:31.960]   Well, it was--
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:32.960]   And then we got into it.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.680]   --the first three episodes were off-putting
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.440]   because they were black and white sitcoms with the one--
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.640]   You're fully in the sitcom.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.520]   It was just the sitcoms.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.280]   It was just the sitcoms.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:42.800]   Really?
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:43.600]   Little.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.920]   And it was like--
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.080]   And you're like, what?
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.120]   This does not age well.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:53.320]   I loved Mary Tyler Moore, but this does not age well.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.280]   The laugh track was grating.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.360]   Apparently there was a myth--
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.640]   Were they original "WandaVision" film before "A Live On It?"
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.520]   So it wasn't a laugh track.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:03.640]   That was a live audience, just as grating.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.120]   But that--
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.120]   And it was painful.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.400]   You don't like people.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.120]   It was painful.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.720]   Once you get through the first three,
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.200]   it actually gets quite good.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.000]   It explains the first three.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.320]   It was kind of a brave move because--
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:21.800]   Yeah, I mean, I guess Big Bang Theory was a traditional sitcom.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.120]   But do they make them anymore?
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.640]   Are their sitcoms on--
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.000]   I don't watch--
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:26.920]   I have a watch Broadway.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.800]   I used to be at Harvard for where TV get credit.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.000]   I don't watch broadcast TV.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.840]   I have a watch on ages.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.640]   Ages.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.960]   Yeah, well, that's part of the problem.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.480]   Nobody.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.240]   Nobody is, aren't they?
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.320]   I think it's all cop shows and procedurals and reality.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.600]   Reality, yeah.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.080]   I don't know if sitcoms are around anymore.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.640]   Maybe that's an interest.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.280]   So it was the first TV--
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.160]   well, the variety show too, right?
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.560]   Milton Burl.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.560]   That was the TV--
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.240]   That was on radio.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:54.800]   Oh, was it?
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.720]   OK.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.240]   See that?
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.000]   Yours are on radio, Fiverr McGee and Molly.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.280]   And that was radio.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.680]   That was the-- but it started.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.920]   But I think it came into its own.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.200]   It was the genre that was meant to be--
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.280]   Yeah, it sure.
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:09.560]   So Aunt, best sitcom ever.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.520]   Your boat?
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.120]   People are not going to like me for this.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:13.640]   Uh-oh.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.000]   They're the children.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.160]   Married with children.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.680]   Whoa.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.240]   I think Lisa loved that too.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.800]   I'm going to say the office.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.280]   The office.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.320]   Seinfeld for sure.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:23.840]   Seinfeld.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.360]   Seinfeld was great.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.560]   Absolutely.
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.920]   Seinfeld was great.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:28.920]   I loved the--
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.320]   Married with children.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320]   Cheers.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:31.640]   Cheers.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.400]   That's pretty--
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.320]   Cheers.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:33.920]   Odd.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.120]   Cheers was great too.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.480]   Cheers with the genre.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.080]   Cheers was the classic of the genre.
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.720]   Not everything.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.960]   The cars and the fier.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:42.880]   And the marriage.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   The--
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.240]   And--
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.560]   So April Fools is tomorrow.
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.400]   Oh, can I just hide all the--
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.000]   Heard your loins because--
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:51.520]   I hate it.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.280]   I hate it.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.320]   Well, one good thing.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.920]   Google is not going to do it.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.640]   Second year running, no Google.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.800]   They were famous for this.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.840]   And I hated it for every moment.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:04.680]   I would love to see that memo that goes out.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:05.680]   No!
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.880]   Here, well, I'll read it to you.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.400]   You may not.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.360]   Are you ready?
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.080]   Business Insider got it.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:10.920]   Oh, really?
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.960]   Marvin Chow VP of Global Marketing at Google.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.400]   Here's the memo.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.120]   Throughout the past year, I've been so inspired by how helpful
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.560]   our products, programs, and people
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.640]   have been during humanity's toughest times.
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.960]   Some might argue if these have been the toughest times.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.800]   But OK.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.640]   We've done it with sensitivity and empathy,
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.160]   reflecting the range of challenging experiences
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.480]   so many are experiencing globally.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.120]   As you may remember, last year we
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.440]   made the decision to pause our longstanding Google
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.840]   tradition of celebrating April Fool's Day out
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:45.800]   of respect for all those fighting COVID-19.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.720]   Really?
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.160]   Really?
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:47.880]   That's why?
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.640]   OK.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.200]   With much of the world still grappling with serious challenges,
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.280]   we feel we should, again, pause the jokes for April Fool's Day
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.280]   this year.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.000]   Like we did last year, we should continue
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.760]   to find appropriate ways to bring moments of joy
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.840]   to our users throughout the year,
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.360]   e.g.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:07.240]   doodles, Easter eggs, et cetera.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.720]   By the way, there is an Easter egg
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   if you search Google forever given.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.680]   It's just a little Easter egg.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.040]   Little boats floating across.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.080]   That's the kind of thing we're talking about.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.440]   Well, I wish Volkswagen--
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.160]   Oh, my god.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.760]   This fooled me.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.360]   This fooled me.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:29.400]   They actually said this is not an April Fool's joke.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.680]   We are renaming Volkswagen America to Volkswagen,
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.560]   because we're all electric.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.440]   Volkswagen America.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:39.120]   They even said--
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.880]   We want to get away from that whole diesel thing.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.640]   They even said this is not an April Fool's joke,
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:47.640]   and they released it two days before.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.760]   That's missing how April Fool's jokes work.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:52.280]   Exactly.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.440]   You don't say that it's not an April Fool's joke.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.360]   Can you get a calendar?
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:00.360]   Volkswagen spokesman Mark Lewis said in an emailed statement
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.800]   Tuesday night, "There will be no renaming
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.520]   of Volkswagen America."
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.960]   The alleged renaming was designed
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.800]   to be an announcement in the spirit of April Fool's Day,
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.120]   highlighting the launch of the all-electric ID4 SUV
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.000]   and signaling our commitment to bringing
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.280]   electric mobility to all."
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:25.000]   So yeah, they released it several days too early.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:25.640]   I bought it.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.000]   Because it comes, I love Hogan's heroes.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:27.760]   That was a great action.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.200]   Hogan!
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.400]   There will be no renaming!
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.760]   How did that ever get on the air?
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.260]   Oh.
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:39.280]   It's popular in Germany now.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.560]   Funny nazis.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.040]   Really?
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.320]   That's weird.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.880]   So Volkswagen, which was clever and certainly
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.920]   got a lot of attention, it did not.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:54.960]   Here's Professor at Dartmouth School--
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.200]   Tucker School of Business, Paul Argeny,
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.400]   said goofing around about who it is
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.080]   and what it's trying to do, particularly with anything
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.720]   related to sustainability, strikes me as really, really bad
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.520]   taste.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.800]   It's just terrible.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:12.400]   They said, oh, we accidentally posted it early.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:18.200]   It's now removed from the website.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.880]   I just want to hide tomorrow.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:20.560]   I just hate it.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.560]   I hate it.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.400]   I hate it.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.160]   It's always ham-fisted.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.160]   If you--
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.720]   Google was actually pretty good at it, but I still hate it.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.280]   Now Google was the best, but still.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.240]   Google, at least you knew, was a joke.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.360]   All right.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.040]   No pranks.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:43.480]   I want to see some great volcano drone footage.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.760]   Sure.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.280]   Please.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280]   What line is that?
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.720]   I'm 107.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.920]   Guy melted one of his drones to get this.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.760]   Ants a big droner.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.640]   Yeah, that's why.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.040]   I used to be-- can't fly around here anywhere.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.240]   Oh.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.760]   I've recently become one.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.840]   I just absolutely love it.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.520]   Which drone do you have, Mike?
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.280]   I have the Mini 2.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.600]   Yeah, that's a nice one.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.680]   Easy to fly.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.440]   Oh, this is-- is this from Iceland?
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.120]   Yes, from Iceland.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.120]   That's what it's amazing.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.960]   Let's turn on the sound here.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.520]   Oh, it's just music.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.360]   No, it's music.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.000]   Yeah, I don't care.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.120]   I want to hear bubbling lava.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.440]   Yeah, if you go to the ones that have the video on them.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.840]   So he apparently--
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:26.720]   Look at this.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.920]   Yeah, that's risky.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:31.800]   You're pretty darn close to the heat.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.720]   Oh, my God.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.240]   He-- he-- he won't-- look, he's going to go with that.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.280]   Watch out for the splashing magma.
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.640]   That's not going to be good.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.400]   Yeah, there it goes.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.360]   By the way, notice picture lost.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.920]   Yeah, he melted one of--
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.760]   Oh, he was last one.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.200]   Wow.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.440]   --fame his legs at that point.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.600]   He flew it.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:50.120]   Oh, you must have-- there must have been uploading footage, right?
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.120]   I mean, how did--
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.320]   Yeah, that one-- that's the one that melted them, I think.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.320]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:55.320]   Oh, beautiful.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:55.820]   You know what?
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.280]   They're beautiful because they're abstract,
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.320]   which is really cool.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.200]   There's also a great video of Icelanders playing volleyball
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.800]   on the lava field.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:08.440]   There's another one of scientists cooking hot dogs
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.600]   on the lava.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.520]   It's just great.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.320]   People have it a fit that they put catch up on it,
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.160]   because they shouldn't do that.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.840]   That's illegal.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.360]   These are-- this is what a drone was made for, though.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.160]   This is really--
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.000]   Is this amazing?
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.320]   --flying right into--
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.000]   Oh, it was not made for flying into a volcano.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.120]   He made it through.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.120]   Oh.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.320]   That is pretty badass, though.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:28.920]   Isn't that good?
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.420]   It is.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:29.920]   Isn't it?
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   Isn't it?
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:35.360]   You have to be-- yeah, though, you'd have to be close enough
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.360]   to fly it, which means you'd have to be in the lava fields,
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:38.720]   wouldn't you?
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.720]   I mean, that's--
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.320]   Yeah, but try to see the ones--
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.560]   --are getting better and better, so you can go far.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.200]   The range is getting better.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.040]   Do you see the one where the guy goes into the bowling alley
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.400]   and he ends up crashing the drone right into it?
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.800]   Yeah, we didn't know that last week.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:53.800]   That is so fun.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.800]   It's beautiful.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.600]   It's beautiful.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:57.680]   I'm loving it.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.840]   Do you think this is an FPV drone, or is it just a standard?
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:06.840]   I presume it's FPV because of the maneuvering.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.520]   So that's the consumer drones.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.960]   You don't get that much flexibility.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:13.760]   He's flying right now.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   So what's the likely cost of his melted drone?
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.960]   $1,000.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.680]   No, probably more than that.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.040]   I bought my son an FPV drone for under $1,000.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.560]   But of course, you trick him out,
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.480]   so it depends how he tricked you out.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.640]   Yeah, I'm figuring minimum 15 plus another $3,400
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.960]   butts for the receiver transmitter.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:36.960]   That doesn't--
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.440]   What if you could reuse that?
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.120]   Who has that?
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.320]   Because he can keep using that on another one.
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.320]   Wow, nice stuff.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.640]   I'll shoot like that.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.360]   Let me think, what do I have to do here before we wrap up?
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.120]   Let me give one more commercial.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.080]   I do want to do the change log.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.120]   Lots more to come with.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.960]   Ant, Jeff, and Mike.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.680]   My three buds.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:04.160]   Always look forward to this show, I got to say.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.480]   I'll show you today brought to you by a new list
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.160]   that I think you're going to want to check out.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:11.160]   The Enterprise Tech 30.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.160]   This is a piece of seminal research
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.680]   developed by Wing Venture Capital in Partnership with NASDAQ.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:24.560]   These are the top 30 enterprises, but they're not public.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.640]   They're in the private enterprise tech sector.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.040]   That's something that's hard to look into.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.720]   You really don't have-- if they're not public,
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.080]   you don't have any idea which company is doing well,
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.880]   or poorly, because they don't have any reporting requirements.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:41.720]   They can be cagey around growth and revenue.
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.600]   Sales cycles can be long and arduous.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.640]   And I have to say, unfortunately, you
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.720]   may see lists like this in other places,
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.560]   but they're A, they're often dominated
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.640]   by well-known consumer brands or mature B to B startups.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.120]   And B, frankly, there's credibility issues
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.600]   because a lot of these lists are produced by lobbying
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.520]   or even pay to play methods.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.360]   And even if they're not, they're absolutely subject
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.880]   to the bias based on how much a company can generate hype
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.160]   around itself.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.880]   That's not the point of the Enterprise Tech 30 effect.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.280]   If you look at the methodology here on the website,
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:24.160]   you'll see this is really done in a very responsible way
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.240]   to make sure that you're going to get a list of the Enterprise
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:30.400]   startups with literally the most potential
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:35.640]   to tectonically shift how enterprises operate for the better.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:38.440]   Anybody on this list, the ET30, they're
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.720]   on a fast track of growth, but they're also really
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.920]   changing how business is done.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.440]   There will be exits, absolutely.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.600]   Future IPO is multi-billion dollar exits.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.520]   You can't lobby your way onto this list.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.200]   You can only be selected and become
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.560]   part of an elite community.
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.880]   The Enterprise Tech 30 focuses on companies with potential
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.240]   at all stages of maturity, not just companies
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.800]   with mature businesses and existing traction.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.360]   There's startups in here too.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.960]   A great buying guide for Enterprise executives
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:10.320]   looking to bring more validated, incredible digital
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.040]   innovation into their organizations.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.320]   Who are the disruptors?
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:16.040]   The people who are going to change our world.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.320]   The Enterprise Tech founders on this list
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.240]   should see their inclusion as the highest endorsement
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.840]   of their current and future success.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.640]   And by the way, if you're planning
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.080]   to build a public or traded company,
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.960]   getting on this list is a watershed moment in your journey.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.120]   Tech executives and high performance operators
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.840]   will use the list to help guide the decisions on what
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.440]   companies to join.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.960]   So there's a lot of interest in this.
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:44.240]   It's now out the 2021 edition of the Enterprise Tech 30
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.920]   brought to you by Wing Venture Capital and NASDAQ.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.200]   Head over to enterprisetech30.com
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.520]   to see who made this year's list.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.920]   Oh, you're showing it.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.760]   (laughs)
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.600]   That's okay.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.520]   (laughs)
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:00.400]   Enterprise Tech, there's a lot more than just the list.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:03.640]   Lots of information at enterprisetech30.com.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:07.320]   We thank the ET30 Wing and NASDAQ
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.680]   for their support, enterprisetech30.com.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:17.960]   Quizzy Teigen is quitting the Twitter.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.800]   She was named by Twitter as the mayor,
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.560]   the unofficial mayor of Twitter.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.440]   She's certainly popular on Twitter,
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.320]   13.7 million followers.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.800]   But after being beat up, blocked by President Trump,
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.080]   attacked by many, she's decided to call it a day.
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.200]   She's leaving.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:43.240]   She'll be back.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.600]   You think she'll be back?
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.480]   It just happens so often, isn't it?
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.320]   It's not.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.720]   I think they also miss some of the people
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:49.480]   who they did it right now.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.440]   It was jerks, so we gotta do a better job
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.640]   of de-jerking the place.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.720]   Did she say she blocked more than a million people?
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.200]   And that was on January 6th.
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:05.120]   That was all around the Capitol insurrection.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.880]   She said, I'm just tired of the two follower punches.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:13.840]   For years, I've taken so many small two follower
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:15.240]   account punches to this point,
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:18.240]   I'm deeply, honestly, deeply bruised.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.520]   I think if you have that many followers,
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.320]   it's gotta be pretty unusable.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.160]   Well, you shouldn't.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.640]   And I think you'll see this on the big accounts like that.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:26.920]   They don't follow people.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.480]   But still, there's nothing to keep people
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.840]   from name dropping you.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:30.680]   That's the problem.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:31.520]   So you can't bring it to Twitter.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.720]   It's a flaw in the structural flaw.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:37.400]   Yeah, maybe she'll come back.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.120]   'Cause you're right, people like her are hooked on the notoriety.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.440]   And I think we'll keep it.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:45.120]   I mean, new mechanisms to make it better.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:45.960]   I hope.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.400]   I see some evidence that they're doing that.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.400]   I think so.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.360]   I think they're working hard
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.320]   because they don't want this reputation.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.320]   Right.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.000]   It's not a good look for any publicly held company.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.360]   So, yeah, it's sad.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.040]   Facebook also introduced new stuff today.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.400]   Yes, big story.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.480]   I was trying to track that down.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:12.200]   That broke right as we went to press, as they say.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.320]   It's line 39.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.680]   'Cause I haven't read up on this.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:18.520]   Let me read.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.360]   It's very long.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:22.560]   It's a 21 minute read according to Nick, Nick, Craig.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.240]   You and the algorithms.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.240]   They're changing the news feed, right?
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:28.640]   Yeah, there are some stuff in there.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:32.840]   This is a very long piece where it's a bit of an issue.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.040]   He kind of tries to say,
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.560]   and this is a fairly standard Facebook stick,
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.560]   is it's not just us, it's you too.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:41.040]   We're giving you what you want and you can change it
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:41.880]   and so on and so forth.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.520]   He's actually addressing three things
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.880]   that we've talked about before on the show.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.840]   The Atlantic article comparing Facebook
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.120]   to the doomsday machine, which you excoriated.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.120]   The Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.080]   which I agree was dopey.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.720]   Shoshana Zuboff's surveillance capitalism.
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:00.560]   You've said--
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:01.480]   Which I roll my eyes at.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.160]   Yeah, not.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:06.800]   But I do agree with Nick that it isn't just Facebook.
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:10.720]   It is us and Facebook is our function.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.640]   It's media and so on.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.440]   So I agree with a large number of his points.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:21.640]   I got upset about a couple things.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:24.040]   I got upset that he has a line in there
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.760]   asking whether government should decide
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:28.080]   what conversations citizens should have.
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:28.920]   They can't.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:29.760]   They're not allowed to--
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.600]   Don't even raise that.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.560]   Why would you raise that?
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:35.400]   You know, and I'm upset that Facebook
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.080]   has been playing the regulatory capture and saying,
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.840]   yeah, go ahead, redo 230, regulate us, it's fine.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.640]   Tell us what to do, we'll do that.
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.600]   That's a cop out.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.280]   They should try to set their own standards of behavior
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:49.400]   and they're still not doing that by then of studying.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.480]   But nonetheless, I generally agree,
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:55.040]   but in any case, in there, they announced a few new things.
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.120]   There's a way down, damn thing.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.440]   Yeah, it's a long article, holy cow.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.800]   Oh, but he has to kind of establish
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.800]   why they did the news feed and all that stuff.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.920]   And before he could say what's going to change.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:11.680]   So they're going to change the algorithm.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.240]   They're changing a few things.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.160]   It's easier to go to chronological versus--
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.160]   How alluia.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.160]   You know, I always--
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.840]   It's always been there, but now they're going to be--
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:21.960]   Yeah, but it would revert.
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.480]   You know, I would go into Facebook,
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.560]   set it to chronological, and the next time I came back,
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.040]   it was back to the algorithmic feed.
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.120]   Honestly, Facebook's initial promise,
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.720]   which they should have a switch for, is
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.520]   I just want to see everything posted
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:39.040]   by the people I follow in chronological order,
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.240]   and that's that.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.000]   And that seems like that's what the Facebook promised.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.560]   This would be the feed of people you care about.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.400]   That seems like it would be pretty good.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.440]   Instagram was that initially.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.440]   And then went algorithmic.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.640]   Even Twitter has gone somewhat algorithmic.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.440]   Somewhat algorithmic.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.440]   Yep.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.560]   Though when I switch on Twitter off the algorithmic,
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.640]   I actually go back to it.
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:03.600]   'Cause I miss things.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.800]   It does find things that I would miss.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:06.640]   Right.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.160]   So I just put up the list of the changes there.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:14.560]   So, you know, we'll see if it makes any difference.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.600]   My argument with Facebook constantly is that,
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:20.040]   that rather than saying,
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.760]   oh, government should regulate us,
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:24.280]   Facebook should come up with a higher order view
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.280]   of what they are,
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.720]   or the governance,
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:27.720]   more should regulate us.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.560]   No. Okay.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:29.400]   Facebook should regulate us.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.720]   I'm looking at some of the changes.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:35.120]   You can control who can comment on your post.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.240]   So I think that's good.
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.040]   Before you've been able to say who can see it,
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:40.360]   now you say,
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.280]   look, you know, maybe this is a public post,
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.000]   but only friends can comment on it.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.360]   I think that's very good.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.200]   That's good.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.040]   Yep.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:49.080]   A feature like that would have kept
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.760]   Chrissy Teigen on Twitter.
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.600]   Right?
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.400]   It would have saved Google Plus, right?
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.320]   Because part of the problem with Google Plus
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.360]   was the spamming you would get in your comment.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.920]   I think on Twitter, can't you do that, Mike?
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:03.040]   I think you can say only people who I follow
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.160]   can comment on people who you can think.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.120]   I think only verified people can do that,
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.120]   but I could be mistaken.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:08.960]   Ah.
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:13.040]   The problem is,
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.240]   I can do that.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:15.080]   I could say,
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.200]   I only want to see comments from verified people.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:19.320]   I can control what I see,
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.560]   but that still does not control what somebody says
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.000]   on Twitter that everybody else can see.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:24.840]   Yes.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:27.560]   So if somebody searches for my name on Twitter,
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.360]   they're going to see stuff I don't see
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.680]   because it's blocked,
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.520]   but they're going to see it.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.200]   That's also true if you leave Twitter,
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:35.960]   so that it has no effect to leave Twitter.
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:36.800]   That's right.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:37.640]   I've left Twitter.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.480]   I don't use it at all,
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.040]   but people can still name tag me.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.040]   Actually, I made my account private.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:44.760]   So does that mean you can still,
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:46.080]   I think you can't name tag me
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.800]   unless you're a friend now, right?
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.640]   And Twitter?
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:50.920]   I think you can still type it out,
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:51.760]   but it doesn't--
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:54.360]   You can type it out, but you can't add Leo to it.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.640]   Right.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.440]   I hope that's the case.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.560]   I don't know, I'm not checking.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:52:59.360]   So I don't know.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.680]   I don't miss it.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:03.440]   I love Mastodon.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.120]   We have now more than a thousand users
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.000]   in our Twit.Social instance,
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.320]   and it's very nice.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.120]   It's exactly where I want to be.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.520]   Because it's kind of like what Twitter was
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.640]   in the old days, it's geeks.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.480]   We had a couple people on there yesterday
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.320]   talking about,
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.120]   we need to have a Twit.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:22.840]   Indie car race outing.
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.200]   Oh yeah, there was a big, big,
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.040]   yeah, 'cause I mentioned
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.040]   I was suddenly in the Formula One last week,
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.600]   and Chris Clark said,
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.000]   "Oh, you should get an indie car.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.720]   They come to Monterey."
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.560]   You know, you could see him in California
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.200]   once or twice this season.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.400]   All right, I'm willing to go.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:38.240]   Road trip.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.520]   Road trip, what else?
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:41.600]   Let's see, what other changes?
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.680]   More control.
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:48.760]   The new tool is example of--
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   Control and curate your newsfeed
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:53.640]   by adjusting your commenting audience.
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:54.680]   You can further control how you want
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.200]   to invite conversation on your public posts.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.880]   Limit potentially unwanted interactions.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:53:59.760]   I think that's good.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.920]   If you're a public figure,
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:03.080]   creator or brand,
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:05.640]   you can choose to limit your commenting audience
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.080]   on your public posts to help you feel safe, Chrissy.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.720]   So Chrissy, come on over.
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.840]   We're making it easier to sort and browse the newsfeed,
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:16.280]   giving you more control over what you see.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.640]   They've launched favorites,
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.840]   a new tool where you can control and prioritize posts
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:21.400]   from the friends and pages you care about
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:22.600]   most of the newsfeed.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:27.280]   By selecting up to 30 friends and pages to include
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:30.160]   in favorites, their posts will appear higher
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:31.800]   in the ranked newsfeed.
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:33.920]   So this is sort of giving me what I was saying.
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.280]   I wanted, it's still gonna put other stuff.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:37.800]   - It's just a heads down that road, at least, yes.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.280]   - Yeah.
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:41.400]   The feed filter bar is a new menu
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.240]   at the top of the newsfeed.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:45.520]   It offers easier access to most recent,
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.520]   so-called chronological feed.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.800]   That's good, and the feed filter bar will be visible
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.200]   on the Android app when you scroll up on the newsfeed.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:55.720]   It's coming to iOS,
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:59.440]   and they're both in the shortcuts menu.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.280]   - All right.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.440]   - Did I miss it or say, why am I seeing this?
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.680]   - Not on Facebook.
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:06.520]   - Singing?
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:07.880]   - She was Twitter, she quit.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:10.720]   - What do I know I'm saying, but is she on Facebook?
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:11.640]   - I wouldn't know.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:13.200]   That's another place I don't hang.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.480]   (laughing)
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.320]   - Same here.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.920]   - Yeah, I don't even have any account.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:18.760]   - Yeah, that's so cool.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.560]   - I kept my Twitter account, I kept my Instagram account,
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:23.080]   mostly so during shows I could display tweets,
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.600]   but I really didn't want anything to do with Facebook,
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.680]   so I just, and I don't miss it.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.640]   You know, it's not like I was addicted,
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:31.320]   and then now I dream about it,
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.640]   and wish I could go back.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:36.040]   I'm fine without it.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.760]   - You're also glowing more, too.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.120]   - I'm glowing much more.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:41.360]   (laughing)
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.440]   - It's 'cause you're on Facebook, you're glowing.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.200]   - Thank you, you're so right.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.320]   Understand why, as you said, Jeff,
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.160]   why you see a post, it'll--
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.400]   - 'Cause you're a Nazi.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.640]   - Yeah.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:55.400]   - Why am I seeing this?
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.000]   - 'Cause you have weird uncles.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.360]   - Why?
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.160]   - Related engagement, related topics, location.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.680]   Okay, so those are the big changes.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:04.520]   So if you're a Facebook user--
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.360]   - Just try.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.280]   - Yeah, good for them.
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:10.720]   You'd think they'd be trying this all the time, but--
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.840]   - Yeah, you'd think that this would be, yeah.
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:16.240]   (clicking)
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.640]   - Let's see.
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:23.440]   Facebook is reopening.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:27.400]   They've set a date for reopening their San Francisco
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.640]   and Bay Area offices, but no free food,
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.840]   and no transit, so stay home.
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.080]   - Ooh, ooh, wow.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.800]   - Yeah, Uber's opening its San Francisco offices on Monday.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.240]   Facebook will open May 10th,
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.040]   and it's Menlo Park offices.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:49.720]   At 10% capacity though, so most people won't be becoming.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.160]   Google has announced it too,
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.760]   has decided it's time to open up the offices
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.920]   sometime in April.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:01.160]   You know, I wish these companies would,
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.920]   I guess they can't legally say it if you're vaccinated,
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.640]   but I think they guess they can't legally say it.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.840]   - Well Rutgers University is saying students cannot return
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.400]   unless they're vaccinated, which I wish my university did.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.240]   I love that.
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.640]   - Maybe a university can do that, but a company can't.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.960]   Google is encouraging workers to get vaccinated,
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.480]   but is not requiring it.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:23.240]   You won't be required to come into the office
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.280]   until at least September,
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:27.400]   but they are starting to open up in April.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:29.280]   They told workers in an email today.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.320]   Microsoft, same thing.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.720]   We talked about that earlier on Windows Weekly.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:40.640]   I would guess that there's some legal limitation
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:43.840]   on requiring, well I guess I'll have to find out,
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.160]   'cause I'd love to say to our employees,
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:49.800]   you know, more than half of them are getting vaccinated now.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:52.080]   You can come back if you're vaccinated.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:53.760]   - So I'm looking up SHRM,
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.240]   which is the association of HR people.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:57.280]   What a fun group.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:02.680]   - It's a perfect name for an HR group.
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:03.520]   - Sure.
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:06.160]   - They went, they went December to lawyers saying,
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.000]   is there a basis?
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.160]   And in some cases they say, yes,
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.240]   if it's a threat to other employees,
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:11.200]   yes, you can require it.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.800]   - A school, it makes sense a school could require it.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.080]   - Right.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:18.760]   - But somebody in the chat room told me earlier today
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:22.240]   that it's because they are not FDA approved,
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.000]   their emergency usage approved.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.440]   So I don't know, I don't know.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.800]   It makes sense you couldn't,
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.440]   so you can demand somebody get vaccinated.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.440]   I wish you could.
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:39.040]   It would be nice if you could.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.520]   - Actually, we're hearing, Mike,
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:43.760]   that Mexico vastly underreported its deaths.
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.640]   And it's a big number now, I think.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:47.720]   - Like 60%.
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:51.200]   Yeah, Mexico is one of those basket case countries
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:54.320]   like Brazil that is just,
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.440]   and I've known this,
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:00.160]   I've been watching it pretty closely for a long time.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.320]   And Bolsonaro has been lying about.
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:05.280]   - In Brazil, yeah.
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:06.280]   - Well, Bolsonaro in Brazil,
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:09.240]   and also what's his name, the Mexican president,
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:11.800]   they've all been lying about it,
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:14.160]   under downplaying it, just like Trump used to.
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.240]   And it's really a problem.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:19.840]   The difference is that the United States
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:22.120]   is very quickly ramping up vaccinations,
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.880]   and that's not happening in Mexico or Brazil.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:28.160]   So it's gonna be a long time for Latin America, I think,
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.880]   before there's herd immunity or widespread diabetes.
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:33.080]   - But you feel safe down there.
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.840]   You and Amira have not got COVID, have you?
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.520]   - We have not.
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:40.440]   - And you've been traveling back and forth quite a bit.
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.000]   - I wouldn't go to most of Mexico.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.280]   I wouldn't go to Mexico City,
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:46.480]   where we have a lot of friends.
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.800]   But Oaxaca is kind of a unique case
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.440]   because it's very spacious, open,
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.840]   and it's amazing.
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:55.040]   Everyone wears masks here.
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:55.880]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:58.520]   - And you go to a, you know,
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:00.240]   the restaurants are all open and stuff like that.
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.440]   You go to a restaurant,
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.080]   you have to walk through a puddle of like disinfected water
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.560]   and wipe your feet on the thing.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.400]   - Really?
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:07.240]   - And they take your temperature,
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.400]   they spray you down,
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.120]   they give you hand sanitizer,
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:12.760]   they give you a bag for your mask,
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.200]   'cause they don't want the mask on the table,
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.880]   so that goes in a paper bag.
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:17.800]   I mean, it's universal.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.320]   100% of the restaurants do all of that.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:20.160]   - And not government mandated,
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.360]   but just kind of everybody's agreed to do this.
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:23.200]   That's great.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.640]   - That's why it's flying in your mic.
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.000]   - It was great.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.880]   I mean, it was, you know,
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.680]   the plane was fuller than when we did it six months ago,
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:33.680]   whatever.
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:36.080]   And everybody was masked.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:36.920]   It was fine.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.400]   The airport was fine.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.840]   I mean, you know, it's, it's, you know,
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:44.960]   I wouldn't recommend travel as it used to happen,
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.920]   but like we're coming down here for the long term, basically.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.160]   And, yeah, but we wouldn't travel the way we did
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.920]   until we get vaccinated for sure.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.240]   But, but coming to, to a hot dog.
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.760]   It's a, it's a straight shot.
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:00:59.720]   And then once you're here,
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:02.480]   it's just very easy to stay socially distant
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:04.840]   from everybody and stay safe.
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:06.480]   So that's why we came here.
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:08.400]   - And tequila will kill anything.
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.560]   - Yes.
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:10.400]   - Including you.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.240]   - Well, eventually.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:12.080]   - Eventually.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:12.920]   - No, no, no, no.
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:15.360]   You don't use the T word and it will hock out the,
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:16.200]   - Oh no.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.280]   - You can use this mescal.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.120]   - A scowl.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:18.960]   - No, excuse me.
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960]   - A keel, excuse me.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:20.800]   Yes.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:21.640]   - Yes.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.320]   So, and that kills everything.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.440]   - Yeah, that kills, that is.
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:26.440]   - Brain cells first.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:27.560]   - Rocket fuel.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.400]   - Exactly.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.020]   - Periscope shut down today.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.280]   - That was Periscope.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.360]   - Another news, Periscope hadn't been shut down yet.
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.640]   - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.920]   It's so funny, you know, Twitter has not,
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:43.360]   does not have the greatest track record.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:44.760]   - No.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:45.800]   - With buying these things,
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:47.840]   they bought Periscope in 2015.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:48.680]   It was very hot.
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:51.400]   - It's the best at buying things and keeping them alive.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:55.200]   - Well, the best at buying things,
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:56.920]   I don't know about the keeping on the live part,
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.840]   but the best at buying things is Apple
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.040]   because they always pay a small amount
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.240]   for non-flashy companies that have really good technology.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:08.080]   They integrate them into their own products
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.640]   and never hear from them again.
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.760]   And almost everything that they buy
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:14.280]   is actually a core part of what they do going forward
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:17.680]   and it's mass, you know, distributed in a mass level.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:18.520]   So Apple, I'd say--
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.880]   - I think it would be a success to other company like that too.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.880]   - And Microsoft has done a pretty good job.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.120]   They've been some big acquisitions like LinkedIn,
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.920]   GitHub, Nokia, Skype.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:32.240]   - Well, I'm joking.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.080]   - No kidding, I didn't work that.
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.040]   - I got a lot of LinkedIn.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.680]   - But a lot of these companies have been okay.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.360]   They certainly don't buy a lot of Nokia was,
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.920]   and Overture was where the kind of post-choice was not.
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:48.520]   - But was it riding on the wall for Periscope?
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.920]   I mean, did you seem like get another fad?
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:53.680]   - Yeah, which TikTok killed them all.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:58.680]   By the way, somebody put a link to a TikTok video on Twitter.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.880]   So Twitter at least still has TikTok.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.600]   (laughing)
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:05.080]   The socially, here it is,
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:09.120]   the socially distanced dance troupe.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:12.480]   - I just put this up for Ant, it will probably irritate them.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.320]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:15.320]   - Oh, I gotta change the sound, hold on.
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:18.520]   Gotta get it to come through my computer.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.440]   Oh my God, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.200]   Ant's missing all the fun.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:24.040]   Wait a minute, let me get this sound.
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.520]   Let's do it over again.
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.920]   - You like ballet, Ant?
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:27.920]   We can probably have that one too.

[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.920]   This is all you see on TikTok.

[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.560]   - Yeah.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.720]   - That ticks.
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.560]   - I feel like that's from--
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:32.400]   - I love that.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:33.240]   - I feel like that creates.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:36.120]   - Then there's more and then there's more after that.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:38.160]   I don't know.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.640]   I don't know what the point of all of that was.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.200]   - Phoenix Warp in the chat.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.040]   Wait.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.800]   - I put up some weird stuff in there.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.320]   - Yeah, Phoenix Warp was about to mute.
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:49.240]   But I muted it for him.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.480]   (laughing)
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:54.080]   I muted it for him.
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:01.760]   I don't care about what happened at Congress last week.
[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:02.600]   It didn't--
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:03.440]   - No, thank you.
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:04.280]   - It wasn't important, right?
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:05.520]   - No, there ain't jerks.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.280]   - You might not care about the fact
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:09.840]   that there's new pixel buds on the way.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.680]   Jeff.
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.920]   (laughing)
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:12.760]   - Will they--
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.320]   - No, they won't work this time?
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.160]   - Is this the--
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:16.000]   - They won't work either.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:16.840]   - Unlikely.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:17.680]   - They won't work this time.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:19.360]   Why do they keep making these?
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:21.440]   This is the third iteration, right?
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:22.280]   Pixel buds.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:23.120]   - No.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.200]   - A, they call them.
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:25.920]   - Well, I guess wired was first, yes.
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:29.480]   The wireless was next and now.
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:31.280]   - Do they just have them stay connected?
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.120]   That's all I have.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:34.680]   - In 2017, they had a wire connecting the two of them,
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:37.240]   but they didn't connect to the, they were still Bluetooth.
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:38.400]   - Right.
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.560]   - And then that was the one where they really seemed like,
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.560]   oh man, they were doing demonstrations at Google I/O
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:44.760]   of instantaneous translation.
[02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:45.920]   They just made it look so good.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:47.480]   - And then it just did-- - It was a piece.
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.920]   - Yeah, it just didn't work that well.
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:50.280]   And then you got the ones that clicked
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.920]   and disconnected and-- - Awful.
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:53.760]   - Yep.
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:56.640]   - And now they've got the new ones, Pixel Buds A,
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.040]   visually indistinguishable from the current Pixel Buds,
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:03.360]   except for new colors, but otherwise identical.
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:05.280]   - But is it like the A phones
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.000]   in that it'll be a lesser model or just a later model?
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.600]   - Yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:12.440]   - Good.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:15.520]   - The branding of the A is it's the cheaper model.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:18.280]   - Yeah, don't know.
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:20.800]   We don't know the price yet, actually.
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:23.280]   So this is just, I guess-- - That'll say a lot, yeah.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:25.880]   - Yeah, that will tell us if A means,
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:29.040]   what A means if it means cheaper.
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.640]   - Did you enter the changelog?
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:31.480]   - Not tell us?
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:32.680]   - Oh, I did, that was a changelog.
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:34.000]   Let's do the Google.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.520]   (laughing)
[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.440]   - Google changelog. - Thank you.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.120]   - It's like you wandered across the border--
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:41.520]   - I wandered into changelog.
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:45.200]   I wandered into changelog.
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:48.160]   Google continually, I think the one product
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:51.440]   Google is updating faster than any others, Google Maps.
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:53.800]   More updates to Google Maps.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:54.920]   - I'm like 100 of them.
[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:57.760]   - Yeah, they're just going crazy.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:00.440]   Live view augmented reality directions come to airports,
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:04.200]   transit stations, and malls, that means you hold up the phone
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:07.520]   and you can see where you are with an arrow and icon.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.080]   So you know that, you know, this is where we're going.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:12.960]   You've had these outside for a while.
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.560]   - There's the-- - And it's--
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.040]   - And he's pretzels that way.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.880]   - Yeah, and he's pretzels that way, exactly.
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:20.600]   - And it's gonna be so good when it's glasses, right?
[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.440]   It's just done the whole of the phone once that's like--
[02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:24.280]   - That's what this is for, right?
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:26.040]   - A.R. glasses is gonna be amazing, yeah.
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:26.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.480]   Now suggestions, by the way, those are,
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:35.040]   the A.R. directions are available in very limited places.
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.120]   Some malls in Chicago, Long Island, Los Angeles,
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:41.040]   Newark, San Francisco, Santa's, and Seattle.
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:43.160]   They'll be coming to transit stations, airports,
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:45.600]   and malls in Tokyo and Zurich in the coming months,
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:46.680]   but more cities on the way.
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:49.320]   As you might imagine, they've got to, you know,
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.760]   shoot video and I don't know what they have to do
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:52.600]   to make this work.
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:55.080]   They have to do some sort of mapping.
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.520]   Here's a video from the Zurich airport,
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:02.120]   how you would get to go down one level, stare at it.
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:03.280]   I think that's good. - That's cool.
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:04.400]   - That'll be very helpful. - That's cool.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:06.840]   - And you're right, Mike, that's what this glasses,
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:10.240]   this is a taste of what glasses could be.
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:12.520]   - I think the augmented reality glasses
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:14.440]   are going to be the coolest thing
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.560]   we're all going to be talking about
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:17.680]   for the next two years.
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:20.080]   Starting with, you know, we're going to hear about apples.
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:20.920]   - I can't wait.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:21.760]   - This year. - Can't wait.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:22.600]   - Yeah, it's going to be so--
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.880]   - I think Mike's the sitcom character
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:26.520]   where his uncle, Mike, he's the last person on earth,
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:28.840]   who's still on Google+, the last person on earth,
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.960]   who's still uses Google Glass.
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:33.360]   - And the Abi Haskell of Tash.
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:36.360]   - Gada, gada, gada. - You're the, um...
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:42.120]   - Oh, I wish I'd spunk faster in my brain, but I'm not.
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.600]   - I'm the Newman of Tash. - The new, hello, Nim.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:45.440]   - There you go, Nim.
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.280]   - Google now will let you,
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:49.160]   there'll be a menu for trip options
[02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:51.280]   and we'll indicate with a little green leaf
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.440]   which trip options are eco-friendly.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.960]   As if you didn't know. - Fewer hills?
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:59.120]   - As if you didn't know. - Less jams?
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.360]   - No, like walk.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:03.400]   It's better than-- - There's that too.
[02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:06.000]   - Walk is better than driving that kind of thing.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.520]   Lots of changes, boy.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:10.360]   - Tons, tons.
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:11.200]   - Tons.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:15.680]   - If the eco-friendly route has about the same ETA
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:19.600]   as the fastest route, it will default to the fuel efficient route,
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.160]   but you could change that in settings.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:23.280]   So that's kind of interesting.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.320]   The most fuel efficient route,
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:28.960]   8% lower CO2 emissions, for example, that kind of thing.
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.200]   - I think that's kind of interesting.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.800]   - Trubial, yeah.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.160]   - There'll be alerts that will tell you
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.160]   when you're navigating through low emissions zones.
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:44.240]   - That matters? - That's not me.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:45.520]   Los Angeles. - Los Angeles.
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:46.920]   - I don't know.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.040]   As Tony Mitt, you're in the,
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:50.800]   it'll initially be France, Germany,
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:52.920]   the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK.
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:55.440]   More countries coming soon.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:58.240]   New map layers for weather and air quality.
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:59.640]   I like that.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.120]   First Australia, India, and the US.
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:06.200]   And there will be a new grocery pickup tool
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.600]   but you'll have to be in Portland
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.280]   and you'll have to be shopping in Fred Meyer.
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:15.200]   It'll let you share your location in ETA with the store
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.480]   via maps so that your groceries are ready when you arrive.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:19.960]   Fred's packing them right now.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:23.600]   Google Meet is extending unlimited video calls
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:26.240]   for free Gmail accounts to June.
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:29.000]   This was something they did for the pandemic.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.120]   It's gonna continue.
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.320]   Kids profiles are rolling out to the Chromecast now.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:38.000]   - By the way, I'm glad I took your advice.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.240]   I got one Chromecast, the new Chromecast
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:41.400]   that I just ordered two more.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.520]   - That's great, isn't it?
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.360]   - Yeah, it is.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.600]   - And they are, for some reason,
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:45.760]   they're keeping that one up to date.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.280]   It feels like that's the product
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.360]   that they're most devoted to.
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:53.280]   - Google is-- - And that's been
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:55.480]   a game changer for those of us who travel.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.760]   So I, you know, staying in one place or another
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:02.840]   and I just plug in the Chromecast and it's just how--
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.680]   - Do you have to?
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:05.120]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.920]   You have to pair it to the Wi-Fi though, right?
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:08.760]   So how do you-- - Yeah.
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:11.320]   - So how does that, I guess you know why?
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:13.000]   - Just go for this in a process.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.040]   - Yeah, your phone's on the Wi-Fi and then you say,
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:15.960]   I see it, okay.
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:17.880]   Yeah, 'cause we'll have a vacation next week.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.280]   By the way, I won't be here next week.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.120]   Jason will be fine.
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:21.120]   - What? - What?
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:23.000]   - I'm going on vacation.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.920]   Haven't done it until awhile.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:25.760]   - On a vacation.
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:28.680]   - Just over the hill in Napa, just to--
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:31.040]   - Calistoga to take the water.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.040]   - What?
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.840]   Was this place where you almost went before
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.080]   in the fire? - No, that burned down.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:35.920]   - Oh, no.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:36.760]   - Oh.
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:39.240]   - The place we, Lisa and I got married
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.600]   and we would stay on a regular, you know,
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.720]   every year on our honeymoon, on our anniversary.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:47.480]   We were going there last summer.
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:48.400]   - Yeah.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.240]   - It would be gonna be our first trip after the pandemic.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:52.480]   When we got there, they said, yeah, you should turn around.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.680]   I think we're gonna get an evacuated.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:55.520]   - Wow.
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.080]   - And it was pretty smoky.
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.520]   And so we cut back in the car.
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:11:59.360]   - It's good.
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:02.080]   - And you know, halfway home got the evacuation warning
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.320]   saying get out, get out. - Oh, no.
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:06.960]   - And it didn't burn down during that fire,
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.000]   but then a subsequent wildfire is just--
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:09.840]   - And it's gone.
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:13.200]   - And here's a pro tip, Leo, for that I learned
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:16.760]   as a part owner of a winery.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:21.760]   Don't get anything from 2020 that the entire--
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.760]   - All the wine is not gonna be good.
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.160]   - Everything's smoked, everything is weird.
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:29.360]   Just, you know, if they offer you like a white
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:31.320]   or a rose or something like that from 2020,
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.400]   just kind of say anything from 2019.
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.960]   - Oh, golly.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.480]   - Yeah, did not think about that.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.200]   - Yeah, the wineries are trying to get through this year.
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:43.680]   They're shipping bottles.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.080]   It's, they're hoping people don't notice and, you know,
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:49.480]   et cetera, but like 2020 was a horrible year.
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.680]   - I thought you said that was an okey, Charton day.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.520]   - It's very okey.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:53.360]   - Smoky Charton day.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:56.120]   - Here's the, I went to the website for the place
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:58.200]   that we used to go, Calistoga Ranch.
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:12:59.040]   - Yeah.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.640]   - And basically, the Calistoga Ranch is closing, definitely.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.080]   There's a picture of a very smoky place
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:07.960]   and a button that says donate.
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.960]   - Save us.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:10.120]   - That's not a help us.
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:12.000]   - It's not a, not encouraging.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:12.840]   Yeah.
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:13.680]   - Ouch.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:14.840]   - Yeah, it's too bad.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.080]   It's owned by a very successful hotel change though, so.
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:21.560]   It's my hope they'll rebuild it.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.640]   So we're going to a different place.
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:25.640]   When it didn't burn down.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:27.600]   So yeah, won't be here next week.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:28.560]   Yeah, I love Calistoga.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.640]   It's beautiful, I love Napa.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.840]   And thank you for that tip.
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:32.200]   We'll look for Wine's pre-20.
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.840]   - Napa's awesome. - 2020.
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.240]   Yikes.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.640]   - So I was thinking, but this all came up
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:39.480]   'cause you mentioned the new Google TV,
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:40.480]   Chromecast with Google TV.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:42.600]   So if I brought that, I should bring that.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:43.680]   - Yes.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.880]   Just plug it into the HMI cable,
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:49.440]   the port back of the TV.
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:50.280]   - Yeah.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:53.000]   - Plug it in and you are good to just,
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.320]   don't forget, I do it.
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.160]   - I do it with you.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.320]   - Don't leave it there, yeah.
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:59.560]   - Exactly, that's the biggest one.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.520]   But they're so cheap that even if you do,
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:02.880]   it's not the end of the world.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:03.720]   - Yeah.
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:05.280]   - I'm totally, that's the person in the room.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:08.120]   The original Chromecast that I had
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:11.320]   up 10 years ago and when I was traveling more regularly,
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:13.440]   you plug it in at the hotel
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.480]   and you have to connect to the hotel wifi,
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.360]   but the hotel wifi had some other--
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.720]   - Yeah, it had a capture portal.
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.560]   - Authentication, awesome.
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:22.160]   Is that still the case nowadays?
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:23.000]   'Cause I don't know.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.800]   I hardly ever turn on a TV at hotels.
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:27.880]   - I don't stay in hotels.
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:29.600]   - Yeah, the Airbnb is just logging.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.120]   Yeah, I don't know, I think the captive portal might not work.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:34.600]   Except that you would do that on the phone
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:37.240]   and you could get through the captive portal on the phone
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.680]   and then you'd have the wifi,
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.600]   maybe at that point you could hand it off.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:42.200]   - That's where a lot of data comes from.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:43.200]   - Yeah, I'll check.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:45.360]   You know, that may be your right,
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:47.320]   we're staying in a hotel.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:51.600]   And here's my next car, a Fiat 500.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.320]   It's got the hey logo on it.
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.480]   - You're not buying the Fiat.
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:57.560]   - No, I'm not buying the Fiat.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:14:59.160]   - But look at the colors on the side of it.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.160]   - I love it.
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:02.960]   I guess when you talk to it, it's gonna do the Google,
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.560]   do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:08.360]   It's the 500, 500 L, 500 X models,
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:11.520]   inspired with elements inspired by the Google colors
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.800]   on the door and in the interior,
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:14.120]   you'd really have to be a Google fan
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:15.200]   and has a little button on it.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.040]   - Yeah.
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:18.880]   - That says hey on the side, sorry,
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:21.240]   it didn't mean to trigger you.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:22.720]   (laughing)
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:23.560]   - I get it.
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:24.480]   I'd like that.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:28.880]   - Yeah, and I guess you can query the Google Assistant
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:31.960]   in the car, but you can also query the Google Assistant
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:34.160]   at home to ask about the fuel level,
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.600]   see if your car's locked,
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:38.560]   switch on the emergency lights,
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:41.240]   you just say, hey, you know who asked my Fiat.
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:44.640]   And that's pretty cool.
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.440]   I think we're gonna see a lot more of that, obviously.
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.960]   - Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:53.480]   - And that is the Google change.
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:56.240]   (engine revving)
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:16:00.320]   - I think we're gonna take a break
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:02.960]   unless you have something else.
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.160]   I think we've gotten, I'm just looking here.
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:08.160]   - You skipped one of the change locks.
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.320]   - I skipped several of the change locks.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:11.160]   - Yeah, you do.
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:12.640]   - Is there one you cared about?
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:13.480]   - YouTube time.
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.080]   - I thought the YouTube hiding likes things was--
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:19.600]   - They test hiding dislikes in response
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:22.040]   to the car targeted campaigns.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.640]   So this happens all the time where you get people saying,
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:28.560]   the thumbs down this, and I guess it'll hide,
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:29.840]   I don't know, it's just a test.
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:32.640]   - And another teaser at the end of the show,
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:35.320]   during the pics, I'm gonna tell you how to do that
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.160]   on your own.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.040]   - Hide the likes.
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:38.880]   Hide it all.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.080]   Hide the likes.
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.440]   I think this is the end of the show, so.
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:50.440]   No, okay, let's see, what else?
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:55.720]   I'm just looking to see if we did Volkswagen.
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.400]   I think we've done everything.
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:00.440]   - You've done everything.
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:01.280]   - What is it that you--
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.840]   - Does it matter if Zoom is gonna have an SDK?
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.440]   Does that make it with you guys?
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:06.280]   No.
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:09.200]   - When they come out with it and people start using it all,
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.760]   I'll talk about it.
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:12.520]   - Yeah, I think we got it, boss.
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:16.080]   - Or the whole likes thing.
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:16.920]   - Okay.
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:18.720]   - Yeah, I really can't let go of that.
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:19.560]   - I find value in it.
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:20.920]   - I find value in it.
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:23.240]   - Of course you do, you're a creator.
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:25.400]   - Well, because--
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:26.680]   - But you know there have been targeted
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:28.320]   dislike campaigns, right?
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:31.000]   - I know, no one would do that to you.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.400]   - Well, see, I think about, this reminds me of
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:39.440]   a This We Can Tech episode from last year,
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:42.760]   and that video had a bunch of dislikes on it,
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:45.680]   and it bugged a crap out of me.
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:48.720]   And I'm glad that I could see that it had dislikes,
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.480]   because I know that people can help amplify that video,
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:55.240]   because it had a great message.
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:57.840]   It was featuring Miss Lexi Savitas,
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:00.360]   and she talked about women in tech.
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:02.200]   - And people disliked it.
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:05.480]   - Yeah, and I'm like, man, this is bull crap,
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:08.040]   and I liked that I was able to see that people were clicking
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:10.680]   dislike in a trolling effect or whatever.
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:12.720]   - So you could push it down.
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:13.560]   - You could click like that.
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:14.400]   - I could fight back.
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:15.240]   - Yeah.
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:17.280]   - So this is an example of what it would look like.
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:19.400]   There's 978 thumbs up,
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:22.480]   but it doesn't show the dislike count.
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.640]   The move was made, quote,
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:27.000]   in response to creator feedback around wellbeing.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.840]   (laughing)
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.320]   - It hurts my feelings when you have the dislike button.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.680]   Could you have the dislikes?
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:38.520]   - So, but that's when you should just get rid of both
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:40.400]   of those buttons, likes and dislikes.
[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:43.440]   If that's the case, if you're worried about wellbeing,
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:44.400]   just don't have like--
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:45.760]   - Yeah, 'cause you could actually,
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:48.000]   if you're a creator, you can still see it
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.560]   in your private YouTube studio area.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:51.400]   - And the stats.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:52.240]   - Yeah, and the stats.
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.280]   - Yeah, but other people can't see it,
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:56.760]   so no one knows that everybody hates you.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:00.280]   - Nobody yet.
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:02.840]   - This is an experiment that will not be around
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.360]   for a long, my prediction.
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:06.680]   One of the reasons I skipped it, it's like,
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:09.760]   yeah, it's an experiment, Google experiments with stuff.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:11.920]   This is these avantets all the time.
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:13.640]   All the time.
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:16.240]   - I predict somethings for a couple of years.
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.400]   - Hey, if you're on Verizon's 3G network,
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:23.400]   the clock is ticking.
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:25.160]   - The by now. - The end is near.
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:27.080]   - The end is near.
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:32.520]   Back in January, Verizon said they didn't really
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:35.080]   have a timeframe for decommissioning the network.
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:37.560]   They've now said, "December, you have some time."
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:40.880]   December 31st, 2022.
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:43.240]   Now, it is the case that there are people with phones
[02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:48.240]   that only do 3G, they don't do 4G or LTE or 5G.
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:50.480]   So there will be people, every time this happens,
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:52.480]   there will be people who will say,
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:55.000]   "Oh my God, you made my phone break."
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:01.760]   Of the 94 million customers Verizon has,
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:05.520]   they estimate about 1% are still using 3G.
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:07.280]   That's almost a million people.
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.520]   That's a lot of people.
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:09.880]   - So I'm having a senior moment.
[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:13.160]   The competitor to CDMA was...
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.680]   - GSM.
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:16.000]   - GSM.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.360]   - You know, I remember that.
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:17.880]   - Verizon was CDMA. - I remember that
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:19.720]   headache that was. - Yeah.
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:21.760]   - Pretty much one, right, was GSM.
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:24.680]   - Well, it did, and now it's LTE, and everybody's LTE,
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:28.280]   and neither GSM nor CDMA, they're all just using LTE.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:32.280]   So you can use GSM over LTE, but, you know,
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:36.400]   between Volte and LTE, and I just everybody's using LTE.
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:40.560]   - Is LTE a flavor of GSM?
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.920]   - No, LTE is something else entirely,
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:46.560]   and most people are, it's the highest speed data,
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:49.440]   and most people are putting voice over LTE.
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:50.640]   - Got it. - All right.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:53.480]   - Some people are doing GSM over LTE,
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:57.200]   but that's, I think, a transitional technology.
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:00.840]   I bet it's gone by now, but I know people were doing that.
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:05.480]   LTE replaces both CDMA and GSM ultimately,
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:07.440]   and it pretty much everybody's got LTE.
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.720]   - Most phones are LTE by now,
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:14.560]   but that's the point of turning off the 3G CDMA stuff.
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:18.000]   - I-- - Could not you miss Stacy?
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.520]   - Pardon me, oh yeah, this is where Stacy could--
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:22.320]   - Thinking about mis-stacy. - Absolutely come in
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:25.640]   and check this out. - Straighten this out.
[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.040]   - Like Cap and Sam, and she just
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.560]   and Roy'd her eyes at us now.
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.920]   - Oh, you guys just don't grasp how this stuff works, do you?
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:33.880]   - It's not a prowl.
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:37.040]   - It's a GSM.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:38.520]   (laughing)
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:43.520]   - There was a really good post on a blog called Stone Soup.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.200]   I posted it more for you guys than,
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:49.120]   but our audience might be interested in it.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.440]   I like that the boat is stuck.
[02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:54.800]   (laughing)
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:56.720]   It's bad that the boat is stuck.
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:58.920]   It's bad for lots of people and lots of reasons.
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:00.440]   I know that.
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:03.120]   Please don't think that me liking the stuck boat
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:04.960]   is an ideological stance.
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:06.960]   This is not an opinion I have about boats
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:11.280]   or about canals or about things generally being stuck.
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:12.960]   It's bad that the boat's stuck.
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:15.720]   It's bad for lots of people and lots of reasons.
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:19.400]   But I can't deny it, I like that the boat is stuck.
[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:23.000]   I like that so far we all seem to agree the boat is stuck.
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.760]   There's no debate over whether or not the big boat is stuck.
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:27.600]   It's a big boat, it's stuck.
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:29.120]   We're all aware of those facts.
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:31.640]   And even those of us who are currently located
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.280]   and out of space believe.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:35.520]   Furthermore, most of us share the opinion
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:37.920]   that it's disagreeable, logistically,
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:40.080]   for the boat to be stuck.
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:41.680]   The boat being stuck is inconvenient.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:43.000]   It's a big disruption.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.600]   Nobody can say it's not a big disruption.
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:47.800]   None of my distant relatives will get into arguments
[02:22:47.800 --> 02:22:50.320]   on the Facebook about whether or not the stuck boat
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:52.020]   is making a nuisance for a lot of people.
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:53.200]   I like that.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:58.000]   Another thing I like, we know exactly what the problem is
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.840]   that is making the boat be stuck.
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:02.440]   It's a big boat and it's stuck.
[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:03.960]   Sure.
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:05.840]   Sure shipping and manufacturing of boats
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:07.160]   and canals of lots of connections
[02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.840]   to varied and sundry historical and sociological issues.
[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:14.720]   But this immediate problem in front of us is a stuck boat.
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:17.600]   And we can look at that problem for precisely what it is.
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:19.880]   It's not stuck for mysterious reasons
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:21.520]   related to a long history of humans
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:23.640]   cruelly exploiting other humans.
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:25.800]   It's not stuck because a politician wanted money
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:28.360]   from an organization that profits from human suffering.
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:30.600]   It's not stuck because someone's pretending
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:32.520]   to be in favor of free speech is trying
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:34.160]   to promote hate for light ideologies.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:38.160]   It's stuck because it's big, bigger than the place where it is.
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:39.480]   And that's why it's stuck.
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:42.640]   I was on.
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:43.480]   It goes on.
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:44.480]   It's good.
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:49.080]   It's an added out and any closes.
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:50.800]   I hope the boat gets unstuck I do.
[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:52.800]   I hope that nobody gets hurt and I extend that hope
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:55.080]   all the way through to every kind of hurt that's possible.
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:57.640]   And selfishly and honestly part of me hopes
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:58.600]   that nobody gets hurt.
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:02.400]   So I can keep on liking that the big boat was stuck.
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.160]   And maybe the boat can just stay stuck for a minute
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:11.800]   so I can keep on cherishing a situation that makes sense.
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:13.520]   The boat is stuck.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:15.040]   That's a wonderful.
[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:17.480]   That's a wonderful post.
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.760]   I wish I had written it.
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:19.600]   I love it.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:20.440]   I love it.
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:21.280]   Respect.
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:25.120]   But let me just throw one horrible spin on this whole thing.
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:26.120]   Oh no.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:30.840]   In the conspiracy theory circles, they in fact believe
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:36.120]   that the boat is stuck because Hillary Clinton was trafficking
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:39.440]   minors and there's a whole--
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.400]   There really is, of course, yes.
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:43.280]   Of course there is.
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:44.360]   Of course there is.
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:49.360]   You know what?
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.920]   I'm trying to find attribution for this.
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:57.080]   All I can say is stone-soup.ghost.io
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:59.480]   and it's written by somebody named Gailie.
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:00.520]   It's really great.
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:01.320]   Really, really good.
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:03.320]   It's what we needed at a time like this.
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:03.640]   Yep.
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:05.480]   Yep.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:06.920]   Let's start.
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:10.880]   Since Mike is visiting us all the way from Oaxaca--
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:12.560]   by the way, we were a little worried because you said
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:15.360]   your bandwidth wasn't great, but it's been beautiful.
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:16.320]   It's been great, yeah.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:17.400]   Yeah.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.480]   Mike Elgin.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.600]   Mikeelgin.substack.com is his new newsletter.
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.680]   Please read it.
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:28.440]   And then when you get it, say, I love this,
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.480]   I'm going to subscribe.
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:33.680]   How much is it to subscribe?
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:34.760]   I think it's $5 a month.
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:36.240]   He doesn't even know because--
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:37.880]   Substack takes care of it all.
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:41.880]   Just sign up for the free thing and you'll love it.
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:44.400]   I guarantee that everyone listening to this show
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:46.160]   will absolutely love it and it's free.
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:47.680]   I'm going to subscribe.
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:49.760]   I like it.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:52.080]   Mike, your pick of the week.
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:55.440]   OK, so I have three quick ones.
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:57.520]   The first one, we were talking about newsletters
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:25:59.920]   and Substack and all that kind of stuff.
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:04.840]   So I'm a paid user of hay.com, the email service.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:06.680]   Oh, yeah, you use it, huh?
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.760]   I don't use it that much.
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.440]   I use both it and Gmail.
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:12.760]   It's very complicated.
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:15.920]   I'm a hardcore zero-inbox kind of guy.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:18.360]   So my inbox is always empty.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:22.000]   And I've written about that on my newsletter.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.600]   But I'm fascinated by the fact that hay has a service
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.000]   that almost nobody knows about that's really fantastic.
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.880]   So if you're a paid subscriber to hay, it costs $100 a year.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:36.600]   And you have a hay email address, which you will--
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:38.600]   they'll give you one if you've subscribed.
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:41.400]   They have a newsletter publishing service
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.680]   that is breathtakingly simple.
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:50.760]   What you do is you write an email to world@hay.com.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:54.840]   And when you do that, it will publish a public page.
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:57.680]   It will create a blog, basically.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:00.400]   And it will offer to anybody who goes to that page
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:05.880]   the ability to either subscribe via RSS or subscribe via email.
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:08.160]   And it becomes an email newsletter.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.640]   Everything subsequently that you post to world@hay.com
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:16.200]   is delivered to anyone who signs up for your newsletter.
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:18.560]   Now, one of the things I love about this
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.520]   is that it's so brain-dead simple.
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.400]   You just write an email and send it.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.640]   That's how you post to this thing.
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:26.040]   That's how you create it.
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:27.200]   That's how you do everything.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.920]   That's all you do.
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.560]   Back in the day, there used to be many years ago--
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:35.640]   people will remember there was a service called Postrus,
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:36.160]   which innovated the--
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:37.760]   Oh, I loved Postrus.
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:39.560]   I'm so sad about Postrus.
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.640]   You could post a blog post by sending an email.
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:44.720]   So you said when I was in China--
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:46.360]   because Facebook and Twitter and everything
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.800]   were blocked back in 2009, I used Postrus
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:53.880]   to blog my trip by email.
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:58.520]   So Squarespace also had that feature
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:01.840]   until about six months after I signed up for Squarespace,
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:03.720]   in which case they canceled it.
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:08.160]   But you used to be able to post a blog post by email
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:09.440]   on Squarespace that killed it.
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:12.120]   It's a rare feature now.
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:15.480]   But Hey World, which is what this service is called,
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:16.080]   does that?
[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:19.080]   You can just do all your blog posting by email.
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:21.800]   Anyway, so if you have any interest in Hey.com,
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.840]   it's another reason to subscribe to that.
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:25.560]   And you can do a sub stack like newsletter
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.760]   without that's even simpler than sub stack.
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:31.360]   Is there an address for your Hey newsletter?
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:33.080]   Are you doing this or no?
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:33.760]   Because you have sub stack.
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:36.200]   I am not currently doing this because I'm on sub stack.
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:40.320]   But it's just a really cool--
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:42.600]   you could use it to actually publish a newsletter.
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.080]   But it's really for--
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:47.840]   for example, if Jeff wants to send a newsletter to 20 colleagues
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.720]   or whatever, or just post something for students or something,
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:52.080]   it's just instantaneous.
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:54.920]   You literally send one email and you've got this thing--
[02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:55.520]   It's done.
[02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:56.720]   You've got all this stuff going on.
[02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:57.560]   You've got a newsletter.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:58.160]   You have a blog.
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:28:59.240]   You have all the stuff.
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:00.680]   So it's very cool in that sense.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.840]   So that's my long one.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:03.240]   I have two very quick ones.
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:06.680]   The second one is I know that at Twitch,
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.560]   among the many coffee making things
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.480]   that are there in the office, one of which is the AeroPress,
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:14.760]   which is always kind of there.
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:15.440]   Yes.
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:16.000]   All right.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.840]   So I have become a huge fan on this trip of the AeroPress
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:26.120]   Go, which isn't getting enough press because it kind of came
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.360]   out right when everybody stopped traveling.
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:30.840]   But the AeroPress Go is a travel version of the AeroPress.
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:33.280]   It's so ironic because I bought Lisa this.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.080]   And then COVID, where you can't go anywhere.
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.440]   We haven't used it.
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:39.480]   But we haven't.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.360]   I've had it for months and haven't used it till this trip.
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:44.720]   But I have to say that now that I'm using it on this trip,
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:45.760]   it's brilliant.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:48.440]   One of the things that people don't talk enough about
[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:51.280]   is that if you're an American and you want to make coffee
[02:29:51.280 --> 02:29:54.400]   and you stay on Airbnb as I do, you go anywhere,
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:56.680]   all the cups in the world are tiny.
[02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:57.200]   Yeah.
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:58.280]   Tiny little tea cups.
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.840]   You can't use the AeroPress Go.
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:00.240]   Yeah.
[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:04.360]   The thing that contains it is this pretty large cup, which,
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:04.920]   you know, you--
[02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:07.600]   Oh, you make it into that thing.
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:08.040]   Oh.
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:09.680]   And then you drink out of this.
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:13.960]   This cup is twice as big as any other cup in this house.
[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:15.200]   And it is like very--
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:18.080]   And it's smaller, though, than the normal coffee mug.
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:20.760]   Because one of the things I didn't like about the AeroPress Go
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:24.640]   is it doesn't have as much capacity as the full-size AeroPress.
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:26.200]   But this is pretty good.
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:27.360]   It's good enough.
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:27.920]   Yeah.
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:30.200]   Size of a large mug, you know, whatever.
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:30.720]   Yeah.
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:33.720]   OK, so that's-- and then the last one is the YouTube one.
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:35.880]   So YouTube is addictive.
[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:37.400]   They dangle all this stuff.
[02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:38.640]   They have the negative comments.
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:39.600]   They have all this stuff.
[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:42.520]   There's an Chrome extension, also a Firefox extension,
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:45.880]   called Improved Tube, which you can get on--
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.840]   all the places you get extensions.
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:51.440]   And you can literally turn off anything or anything.
[02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:52.440]   You can change the color.
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:53.120]   You can do all that stuff.
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:54.920]   But you can turn off the pitches.
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:56.760]   You can turn off the likes.
[02:30:56.760 --> 02:30:59.240]   You can turn off everything and anything.
[02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:03.640]   You can totally control what you see on YouTube with this.
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:06.320]   It's been around for a while, but everybody loves it,
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:07.720]   because you can really, really--
[02:31:07.720 --> 02:31:09.120]   Is it improved YouTube?
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:10.200]   Or is it--
[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:10.720]   Oh, it's--
[02:31:10.720 --> 02:31:11.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:11.800]   That's--
[02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:12.280]   OK.
[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:13.280]   This is it.
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:14.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:17.160]   They call it Improved YouTube and Improved Tube.
[02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:17.520]   I don't know.
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:18.360]   It's a terrible name.
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:19.360]   Yeah.
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:19.800]   But in stories--
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:22.440]   I was looking at the new version, the beta testing version,
[02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:23.920]   but you can install the regular version.
[02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:24.360]   Yeah.
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:24.880]   OK.
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.960]   If you have a problem with YouTube addiction,
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:30.280]   which a lot of people do, you go to the site,
[02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:32.160]   and you get sucked into all the recommendations
[02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:35.200]   and stuff like that, you can just make all that stuff
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.440]   invisible, and you'll never see it again.
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:41.600]   And it makes it a lot less addictive and less
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:42.240]   of a time sink.
[02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:44.840]   So I recommend that anybody who goes to the YouTube site
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:48.120]   on their browser, that they install this and customize
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:49.440]   what you see on YouTube.
[02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:53.040]   Improved Tube.
[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:56.000]   And I saw when Hate came out with it,
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.800]   I thought, oh, I should maybe--
[02:31:57.800 --> 02:31:59.960]   because I did a trial, but I didn't buy Hate
[02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:01.800]   because it's $100 a year.
[02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:02.320]   But now--
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:02.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:05.880]   But you find it good for email.
[02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:08.120]   Oh, yeah, it's great for email.
[02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:10.400]   For those people who are unfamiliar--
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:11.760]   I can't use my email.
[02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:13.040]   I just can't use email.
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:13.840]   Yeah.
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:14.840]   So that's--
[02:32:14.840 --> 02:32:16.520]   Hate is great for that because you basically
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:19.360]   have to green light everything that comes in.
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:22.960]   So if something comes in and if they've never emailed you
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:26.560]   before, you have to actually go and say, I want this.
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:28.120]   I don't want this.
[02:32:28.120 --> 02:32:29.280]   I want this to go in this--
[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:31.840]   So you only get the mail you want.
[02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:32.560]   Exactly.
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:35.280]   And so after using Hate for a while,
[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:37.520]   you really get control of your inbox.
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:41.600]   And then when you direct things into different folders,
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:44.640]   you can see the folder as a single, long page.
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:47.680]   So for example, I do that for Google Alerts.
[02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:51.360]   So I want to look at those every three, four days or whatever.
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:52.600]   And I just go into that folder.
[02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:53.880]   And it's just one page.
[02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:57.440]   I go through all the alerts just quickly.
[02:32:57.440 --> 02:33:00.400]   It's not one thing that I close it and go to a next thing.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:02.440]   It's just one page with all the alerts.
[02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:04.120]   So you really save a lot of time.
[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:05.760]   And it's a great email service.
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:09.680]   So you really forward your old email addresses into it.
[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:13.280]   Because now you have an @hey.com address, which I don't want.
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:14.080]   That's right.
[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:15.480]   So what do you do?
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:18.880]   This is the problem that nobody talks about hate.
[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:22.240]   Hey, because if you send from hey,
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:25.480]   then the thing goes into hey, but it doesn't go into good.
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:28.160]   So if you're using both, if you're on the fence,
[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:29.560]   it's not a good solution.
[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:30.080]   Yeah.
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:30.920]   If you want to completely--
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:31.840]   You have to be all in.
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:32.880]   It's a great solution.
[02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:35.880]   And if you want your own hey address,
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:36.840]   you're going to pay more.
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:39.520]   They charge a lot for ultra short email addresses
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:41.160]   and stuff like that.
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:44.120]   But you can't use it with anything else but hey.com,
[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:45.920]   essentially.
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:46.520]   Right.
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:47.360]   And it's--
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:49.120]   That's my problem.
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:49.760]   Yeah.
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:51.600]   It's not for everybody, for sure.
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:53.360]   But if people--
[02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:55.680]   most people have a real problem with email.
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:56.720]   It's interesting.
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:57.960]   And I wanted to mention--
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:02.840]   Because I was a huge Postrous user back in the day.
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:05.320]   And when they went out of business, I was very sad.
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:08.760]   But they went on to create something called Posthaven.
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:10.120]   It's at Posthaven.com.
[02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:12.960]   Five bucks a month, they promise we'll never--
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:15.760]   because we're charging enough to keep it going forever,
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:17.440]   we will never stop.
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:21.960]   It would impost-- it imported my old Postrous blogs.
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:22.480]   That's cool.
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:23.600]   And yeah.
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:27.240]   So I don't use it anymore, but I used it for a long time
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:29.520]   as a replacement for Postrous.
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:31.120]   So if you've been thinking, well, what can I do?
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.320]   Posthaven.com.
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:34.880]   And I do love the Aeropressco.
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:37.040]   So--
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:39.400]   So there.
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:42.880]   Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number?
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:44.920]   I'm actually going to do a thing, because Stacy's not here.
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:46.240]   Do a thing.
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:49.120]   So a Kickstarter that actually worked for me.
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:50.800]   I just thought I'd mention it since I bought this.
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:53.000]   This is the charge.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:54.360]   Charge?
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:55.520]   Charge.
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:00.720]   This is a 65 watt charger with two USB-C's
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:01.960]   and one USB-A.
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:02.480]   Oh.
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:05.680]   I bought this before the pandemic,
[02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:06.920]   because when traveling, I didn't want
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:10.560]   to carry around bricks and chargers and on converters.
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:12.320]   So just one.
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:14.800]   And it's magnificent.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:15.920]   So I just bought two more.
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:16.840]   Boy, it's small.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:17.360]   Traveling them.
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:18.240]   And that's in a very--
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:19.680]   That's a very laptop.
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:22.680]   A laptop with my phone and something else every night.
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:23.720]   I use it.
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:25.240]   And then the other beautiful thing--
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:27.840]   the original one, I didn't get this.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:32.120]   So what I ordered, it's $39, so it's a lot cheaper than an Apple
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:33.440]   or a Google.
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:37.160]   So here's your basic connector for--
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:40.360]   Here's-- the plugs come down, right?
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:42.240]   So that's the whole charge.
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:44.720]   It's a wall where it just plugs into the wall.
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:45.600]   Plug it up.
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:48.560]   And then all you do is squeeze this--
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:50.200]   Oh, it's a change.
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:51.800]   Oh, it makes the international nice.
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:53.480]   And you've got internationals, because of those three.
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:54.320]   So it's really nice.
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:55.880]   And I thought a Kickstarter that actually worked,
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:57.480]   that actually delivered, I'm going
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:58.480]   to give them a plug.
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:03.280]   If you go to their site, oddly, the link from there to Amazon
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:03.840]   doesn't work.
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:05.920]   Just go to Amazon and search for charge.
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:06.920]   And you'll find it there.
[02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.400]   S-H-A-R-G-E.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:11.920]   S instead of a C.
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:12.440]   Oh, man.
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:13.640]   I need that so bad.
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:14.680]   This is the--
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:17.320]   I did this tonight today for you, Mike, yes.
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:17.800]   Thank you.
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:18.720]   Yes, I need it.
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:19.440]   This is the--
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:19.440]   Perfect.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:21.600]   This is a gallium arsena--
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:25.240]   gallium nitride technology that lets you do much smaller
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:25.800]   chargers.
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:26.720]   They don't get as hot.
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:27.960]   It's really-- that's really cool.
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:28.480]   That's really nice.
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:29.640]   It's a really good idea.
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:31.840]   Oh, I want one.
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:32.600]   Very good.
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:33.880]   I like your pick.
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:35.080]   You could do that more often.
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:37.600]   You don't have to always do a number.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:41.560]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, your pick.
[02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:45.040]   For me, I have presets for a lightroom
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:47.960]   that I've been dabbling with and playing around with,
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:50.880]   because over the pandemic, I found
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:56.400]   that when I shoot certain styles come to mind
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.320]   and certain color tones come to mind whenever I shoot.
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:02.560]   And so I figured, you know what I might as well just speed up
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:05.240]   my workflow and just create some presets.
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:07.800]   And when I started posting things on Instagram
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:10.360]   and mentioning that I use my presets,
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:13.600]   people were like, you go and publish these presets?
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:16.280]   And I thought I got around to publishing the presets.
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.680]   And they are on my website in this--
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:19.040]   Oh.
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:22.600]   --blog, antpruit.com/blog.
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:24.920]   And these presets are-- they are for a lightroom.
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:28.720]   But if you're a Capture One user, they are in some instructions
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:31.720]   in the post that shows you how to import them
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:34.480]   into Capture One as looks as well.
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:36.840]   So here's the blog.
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:37.680]   Scroll down.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.200]   Where is it?
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:38.560]   Oh, yes.
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:39.080]   Scroll down.
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:40.080]   It's like the next pro.
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:40.760]   So I'm sorry.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:41.520]   Here it is.
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:42.360]   Nope.
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:44.320]   That's by the way we should mention this.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:45.440]   You're going to New Orleans.
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:48.680]   We've given a workshop, October 10th through 14th,
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:52.240]   at the Wanderer's Photographic Cultural Experience.
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:52.840]   Yeah.
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:53.840]   What will you be teaching?
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:54.840]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:57.520]   I will be focusing more on street photography
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:59.800]   and cityscape photography.
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:03.200]   So in this hands-on event, New Orleans
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:03.760]   is my group.
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:05.280]   May be pre-entiment.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.600]   That'll be fun.
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:09.800]   And while you're at antpruit.com/blog, sign up for that.
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:12.240]   And then you can get the right below it.
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:15.760]   The presets, like the crazy morning preset.
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:16.880]   Cozy morning.
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:17.560]   Cozy.
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:18.640]   It looks crazy to me.
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:20.120]   OK, cozy morning preset.
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:20.800]   Cozy morning.
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.840]   Cigar and whiskey preset.
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:23.880]   Cigar and whiskey.
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:24.760]   Oh, I like that.
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:26.000]   That's a nice look.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:26.880]   That's nice.
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:27.680]   The biscuit--
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:28.200]   The biscuit.
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:30.040]   The biscuit named after your dog.
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:32.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:34.480]   Aww.
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:37.440]   And I tried to describe what the presets are doing,
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:41.040]   because a lot of people will sell presets and say,
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.720]   I call it toaster and yada yada yada.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:46.000]   They never really tell you what they're for.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.240]   So I tried to describe what each of those presets
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:50.880]   are going to do to give you a good starting point
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:51.600]   for your image.
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:53.720]   It's not necessarily a finishing point,
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:55.280]   even though sometimes it can.
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:58.120]   But it gives you a good idea of what I'm working with
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:00.920]   and the direction that I'm going with that particular image.
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:02.640]   And hopefully it'll be out.
[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:03.160]   Kind of stuff.
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:04.160]   I like it.
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:05.160]   I like it.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:06.160]   I like it.
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:07.160]   I like it.
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:08.160]   I like it.
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:09.160]   I like it.
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:10.160]   I like it.
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:11.160]   It's off photography.
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:12.000]   Yay.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:12.000]   @pruit.com/blog.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000]   Check it out.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.440]   And do sign up for ants.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:16.000]   If you're going to be in New Orleans in October,
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.560]   or you want to be in New Orleans in October--
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:18.560]   Want to go.
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:20.480]   It's a good time of year to go to New Orleans.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.280]   It's too hot in the summer of October of New Orleans.
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:23.280]   Yep.
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:24.280]   Very nice.
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:25.280]   Yeah, it's muggy.
[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:26.280]   Muggy.
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:27.280]   Very cool.
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:30.400]   Ah, thank you, everybody.
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:31.400]   Great show.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:32.400]   Lots of fun.
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:33.400]   Yeah, it's fun.
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:34.400]   Appreciate it.
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:38.200]   Don't forget, Mike is a Gastronomad at heart.
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:41.160]   Of course, you mentioned Mike Elgin.substack.com.
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:47.720]   But Gastronomad.net is the place to go if you would like to travel and eat and enjoy.
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:49.200]   We're getting back up on the road.
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.000]   I can't wait.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:58.160]   Halloween is coming, and that's when you're going to do, for sure, by then it'll all be
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:03.360]   A-OK to go and do the Day of the Dead in Oaxaca.
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:04.360]   Wow.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:05.360]   That's right.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.440]   We have room for one couple left, and this is the last time we're doing Day of the Dead.
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:12.840]   And Day of the Dead is crazy around here because everybody wants to be here for Day of
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:13.840]   the Dead.
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.240]   This is the Day of the Dead epicenter of Mexico.
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:18.240]   We're doing it once.
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:26.080]   So if you want to really have a unique life-changing experience, then be that last person.
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:29.600]   I'm sending this to Lisa right now.
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:33.200]   You're going to have to fight me off.
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:37.360]   Yeah, we're trying to decide.
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:39.800]   We figure maybe by this fall we'll be able to do something.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:42.480]   So yeah, I think that would be great.
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.160]   Oh, man, I would like to.
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:46.280]   We have our own compound.
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:47.480]   Nobody else is there.
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:51.120]   So it's like very socially distant experience.
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:52.640]   I would love to do this.
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:54.280]   And I love that area.
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:55.280]   It's southern Mexico.
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:56.280]   Yeah.
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:57.280]   It's a beautiful area.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:58.280]   So cool.
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:40:59.280]   Yeah.
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:00.280]   Yep.
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:01.280]   Thank you, Mike.
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:05.680]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:11.920]   Craig Newmark, New York Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:20.360]   More TV guy, critic Frank Sinatra called him a bum, buzzmachine.com@jefjarvis, writing
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:22.640]   a book called Moral Panic.
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:23.640]   No, Gutenberg.
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:26.440]   First, first, the Gutenberg parentheses.
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:27.600]   Yes, trying to get out.
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:28.600]   Gutenberg parentheses.
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:32.280]   Is it parentheses or parentheses?
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:33.280]   Parenthesis.
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:39.640]   And I just found out that in England, the parentheses is what is included.
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:42.040]   In the United States, it's the brackets.
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:43.760]   Oh, yes.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:49.360]   So they're saying the parentheses is the contents of what do they call these?
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:50.360]   The parentheses?
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:52.560]   I guess so, or brackets.
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:53.560]   Brackets.
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:54.880]   And Americans call what's included.
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:59.200]   We call it a parenthetical expression, which doesn't necessarily need to be between parentheses.
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:01.080]   It could be between comments.
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.080]   That's right.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:04.520]   And so we're just a much more evolved culture.
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:06.000]   I think so.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.680]   We've got it more sophisticated.
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:10.680]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:11.760]   Stacey, you'll be back next week.
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.360]   I will not be back.
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:18.760]   So Jason Howell will be hosting along with Jeff and Ann Prueh.
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:26.400]   Ann is at twit.tv/homperantprueh.com when I'm not hitting the mic.
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:27.800]   Bad mic.
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:28.800]   Bad mic.
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:31.160]   Anyway, we thank you all for being here.
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:33.680]   We do this week in Google on a Wednesday afternoon.
[02:42:33.680 --> 02:42:38.400]   We're at about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:45.920]   If you want to watch us do it live, just go to twit.tv/live.
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:47.280]   And there's audio streams there.
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:48.280]   There's video streams.
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:49.800]   You can pick a stream you can watch.
[02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:56.600]   As you watch live, open up, pop open, a little IRC window for our chat room at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.800]   So you can talk with the people who are also watching live.
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:43:02.120]   It's kind of a fun community experience.
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:07.360]   We also put on-demand versions of the show up on the website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:09.720]   You can also get it from YouTube.
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:14.560]   There's a YouTube channel devoted to this week in Google.
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:17.280]   Or get your favorite podcast application.
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:19.960]   Search for this week in Google and subscribe.
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:25.560]   That way, you'll get it automatically the minute it's available on a Wednesday evening.
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:26.880]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:28.080]   We'll see you next week.
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:31.800]   Well, I won't, but they will on this week in Google.
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:36.200]   Actually two weeks from now, I will be just coming off my second shot that day.
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:41.200]   So I might be a little green two weeks from the 14th.
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:42.200]   I'm sorry.
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:43.200]   No filter needed.
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:45.200]   See you all then.
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:46.760]   Bye bye.
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:49.400]   You know what's fun, Android.
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:50.960]   You know what's even more fun though?
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:51.960]   All about Android.
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.240]   That's my show, Jason Howell along with my co-host Ron Richards, Florence Ion.
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:02.040]   And we welcome guests on each and every week from throughout the Android ecosystem, developers,
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:07.280]   Googlers, journalists, people who are all geeked out about the Android operating system.
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.040]   We tell you everything you need to know, twit.tv/aa every Tuesday.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:12.520]   We'll see you there.
