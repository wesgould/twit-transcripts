[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff and Gina here.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.200]   We'll talk about Google's privacy policy, Twitter censoring the world,
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.900]   and the IPO for Facebook.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.100]   Maybe before the show ends, we'll find out.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.600]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.900]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900]   From people you trust.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.500]   This is Twig.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.900]   This is Twig.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.900]   This week in Google, Episode 132 recorded February 1st, 2012, the Google Father.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.900]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and we're back to talk about Google
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.900]   and the Google verse and the cloud and Facebook and Twitter too and all of that stuff with Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York, the author of a great book.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.900]   Cut two great books, what would Google do in as new as public parts?
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900]   Talking about life in public, thank you for being here, Jeff.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900]   Thank you.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900]   Gina Trapani from smartawear.org, founder of Life Hacker
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   and the creator of the amazing Think Up at ThinkUpApp.com.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.400]   You must have been given your association with Open Government
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   and the White House excited about the Google Hangout that the President did.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   Was that why?
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   I was. I was pretty geeked about it.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   In fact, Expert Labs had a conference call scheduled for around the time of the Hangout,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   it was supposed to happen and I said to a Neil, like,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   "But the President is going to be on Google+, and he was like,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   "Okay, we'll move the meeting."
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   So we could all just think we could all watch.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   I thought it was pretty cool. I was pretty geeked out about it actually.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   You know, I mean, of course, it's an election year, so we see a lot more engagement on social media networks.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   And all that.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   But it was neat to see the President interact with real folks,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   even though it was a little awkward at times.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   And pretty scripted.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Pretty scripted.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   But yeah, I mean, the questions were certainly vetted,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   and those people all kind of approved, and they had a moderator from Google.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   I mean, that's true.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   But at one point, there was a woman whose husband's been out of a job for three years
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   who really took the President to task for that.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   But then they had, you know, a section where they could ask a personal question,
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   and she asked him to do a jig.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   Yeah, that one I could have done without that.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   Yeah, I could have done without that too.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   I agree, but you know, this is what happens when, you know, I mean,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   the state of the media is not interactive by definition, right?
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   A speech is the President, you know, talks to you.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   But this was real people talking back, and I thought there was something refreshing about it
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   if a little annoying at times.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   Real people can be annoying at times.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   It's funny.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   That is exactly the point where I got a little cringey is when she asked me to do a jig.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   It was almost like dance monkey dance.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   It was like, it was the pre-- I understand that because it's a Google plus hangout,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   perhaps you feel like it's informal.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   But this is the President of the United States.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   You don't say dance.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   I agree, but he was gracious about it.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   He handled-- he answers questions well, I thought.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   Oh, he was great.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   And I thought very-- what I did think is this medium suits him well.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Of course, he's done a lot of town halls, which is pretty much the same thing.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   But he was very genuine, very authentic.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   I thought he did a nice job.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Jeff, go ahead.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Which one was worse than or boxers briefs?
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   Did somebody-- I missed that.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   Somebody didn't--
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   Bill Clinton.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   Bill Clinton.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   MTV Town Hall back in the day.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Students stood up and asked the President of the United States, boxers or briefs.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   And this was before Lewinsky.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   I think boxers and briefs is a stupid question, but the problem with dance is there's an
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   undertone that I don't like.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Shh.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Got it.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Got it.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   It feels racist, to be honest.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   It's like, hey, you're putting on a show, can you dance for us?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   It just did not-- I don't think that that's what she was saying, but it felt like, ooh,
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   there was a, I think, a higher cringe factor in some regards because--
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   Well, I mean, he did sing Al Green at an official event.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   It's true.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   And he handled it beautifully.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   He did.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   Instead of taking Umbridge, he said, well, I've sung, but if you listen to Michelle, I shouldn't
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   dance, and I thought that was a good--
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   It was a good way to respond to, oh, what's he going to say?
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   I'm the president.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Yeah, you can't do that, right?
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.480]   And then actually, that's an interesting issue because using social media brings you down
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.640]   at a level of the public.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   And notice I say down because I do believe that because you're president of the United
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.000]   States, you deserve a lot of respect and you are not of the people.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.840]   You work for the people, and Obama said that, which I thought was good.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.320]   I think that that was really good.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.640]   But I don't know.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.640]   Maybe a president should be populist.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.960]   I mean, he's the one who talks about the bubble that Washington is, you know, and trying
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.200]   to be more in touch with the people that he's serving.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.360]   So I think it was a good thing.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.400]   It was interesting to see, and I'm going to see if I can find that picture.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.640]   They had a picture on Flickr of the setup that the moderator at Google was his name Steve
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.200]   was using.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.120]   Wow.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]   That's pretty nice.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.000]   Of course you were interested in that setup.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.720]   I was very interested.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.480]   What's interesting is the magic of TV within the square that you could see it all look
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.880]   like this, right?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.280]   But then you go immediately, you go outside the border and it's just like all this crap.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.000]   And that's what we don't do here.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.600]   I thought it was a very traditional moment, TV moment, you know, the poor guy sitting like
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.320]   with all this gear and lights and all that stuff around him was not very relaxed.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.240]   I haven't seen the president set up.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.680]   I imagine it was equally was that at the president was in the West ring, right?
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.600]   So that was the Google moderator set the set up.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.440]   Google moderators set up, right?
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.600]   You know, it's not much different from when Obama was at Facebook and doing a town hall
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   at Facebook.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.800]   It's kind of the same idea in a way it is saying it's making a statement that Silicon
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.200]   Valley and geeks like us like acknowledging our importance.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.000]   Mark Zuckerberg's importance, Google's importance, but it's not so very different than any other
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   town hall, maybe even less open than a regular town hall.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.120]   It wasn't, but it was a big commercial for Google Hangouts.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.400]   I mean, it was the tool.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.600]   I mean, that's exactly what the tool looks like, right?
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.920]   I mean, people use Facebook don't get to sit down on a stool with the Zuckerberg in a
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   suit, right?
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.960]   I mean, it was, you know, it felt much more.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.400]   I actually kind of wanted to see the president on a regular webcam in front of sitting in
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   front of a regular desk instead of having, you know, his kind of nice oval office or set
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   up.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.320]   But of course, it makes sense that he was there, but it felt a little bit like, oh, this is
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.240]   this is the president using a tool that anybody can use.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.240]   And this is what it looks like.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.040]   They're going to do another one Thursday with a niche Chopra and Steve Case founder of AOL
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.440]   and Gene Spirling.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.000]   It's going to be focused on startup America, which I think is kind of kind of interesting.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.560]   That's Thursday, 530 Pacific, I'm sorry, 530 Eastern, 530 PM Eastern.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.320]   So this isn't just a one off.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   And in fact, in some ways, I'd like to see this used more not by the chief executive,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.600]   but by people like Gene Spirling, who's the director of the National Economic Council.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.160]   And niche Chopra are outgoing CTO.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.360]   Those are the kind of people who couldn't really answer some questions.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.400]   Steve Grove, who did that, who really he started the politics channel on YouTube and did a
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.800]   tremendous amount of work there.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.200]   And now he's doing this Google plus we got to have on the show.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   Well, that's good.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.400]   Very nice guy and really built something very impressive out of nowhere.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.480]   And he's not necessarily a news guy, but he created something that has real news value
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   across the services.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.240]   They're also using, I think, look, it was this Obama followed in probably in John Dean's
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   footsteps.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.880]   It was Dean, of course, who first started realizing the power of social media for fundraising.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.280]   Obama took it to the top level in 2008 and then disappeared.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.480]   We actually had Clay Johnson on our show last week on triangulation.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.840]   Clay was responsible for the digital strategy in the Obama campaign in 2008.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.160]   And I said, what happened?
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.920]   It was a real letdown because we thought that they would continue this.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.200]   And he said, we would have liked to, but you have to understand when you move into the
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.360]   White House, you're moving into Windows XP, you're moving into a situation where technology
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.440]   is backward.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.960]   And there are all sorts of reasons why you can't just start tweeting.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.000]   And I think that that's true.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.620]   He said, though, that progress is being made and you're going to see more and more and more.
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.040]   And I would hope in 2012, whoever gets elected, that we do see these tools used as they you're
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.160]   using ThinkUp for more transparency.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.880]   As they use the petition, let's face it.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.600]   And I think Clay actually implied this.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.880]   He said, the petitions are really just a way of harvesting email addresses.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.640]   Don't think he didn't say this specifically about the White House petitions, but he said,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.080]   you know, when you're asked your opinion, it's taken for me as somebody who ran these
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.320]   campaigns.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.840]   It's about the email address.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.320]   It's about getting you to donate.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.760]   It's about getting back to you and saying, Hey, we're so glad to hear your opinion.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.000]   And your opinion is so valuable to us.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.080]   And you know, it's we sure could use some help here.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.600]   And so I think that that's that's the problem.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.440]   And we're such a cynical electorate, aren't we?
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.600]   I mean, that reason.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.880]   Yeah, with good reason.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.960]   I like what they did with the state of the union.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   Have you seen this?
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   This is a YouTube.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:59.080]   They posted a YouTube enhanced video of the state of the union where they had the the
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.760]   speech on the left.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:07.400]   They posted this early and then on the right, graphs, charts.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.200]   This is how I watched it.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.040]   Isn't this great?
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.960]   Now, admittedly, this is a way of manipulating the message a little bit because this comes
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.280]   from probably well, it comes from the White House.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.920]   So I guess it's not from the campaign.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.440]   No, it's not the campaign.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.480]   That's the White House.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.160]   And I don't know if people make that distinction, but you should folks that, you know, stuff
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.280]   like when he's like the Google plus account, the Twitter account, that's the campaign,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   right?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   Right.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   The Michelle Obama Barack Obama accounts are the campaign.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.880]   The White House account is White House.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   Right.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   And so this is on WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.360]   So this is the executive branch trying to give you more information and using YouTube
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.600]   for it.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.800]   I love that.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.720]   I mean, go right to the people.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.520]   Disintermediate the networks, the news media.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.720]   You know, that's very interesting.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.080]   And there's a White House.gov iPhone app.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.640]   You could stream live the state of the union, the enhanced version on your iPhone, which,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.280]   you know, it's not the best app in the world, but it works.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.840]   And yeah, you know, at expert labs, we did analysis of activity, Twitter activity on
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.480]   the state of the union, around the state of the union.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.880]   As many people did, analyzing the hashtag, so, so to you, hashtag, we actually analyzed
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.360]   the conversations that had involved mentions about White House or at WH Live, which is the
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.160]   White House Live account, which basically just live tweets, speeches, you know, soundbites
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.600]   from speeches.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   And that was really interesting to see.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.520]   I mean, we had, you know, we were getting, I'm just looking at some of the numbers right
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.520]   now.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.200]   We had a 30% increase over last week's last year's activity.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.560]   We had like 21,000 tweets come in that mentioned the White House or White House Live.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   That's cool.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.120]   6,200 people, unique people responded.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   And it was interesting.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.720]   People responded to the moment during the speech that SOTU, SOTU, hashtag, PETA.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.680]   A little, it's currently close to STFU, by the way.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.160]   I just believe it is.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.120]   They need a new acronym.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120]   It is.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.560]   This build milk joke was the kind of moment where we had the most tweets of the hashtag
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   overall, but it was actually the mention of Lincoln and Steve Jobs that resonated with
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.200]   the people who are actually following White House and talking to White House directly.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   So I think there's a big difference between talking about an event and talking to your
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   government.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   Right.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.680]   So that was interesting for us.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.200]   And yet that kind of engagement talking about an event is the kind of, I mean, that's
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   the start.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.560]   Engagement is what it's all about.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.080]   By the way, after you go to the Hangout with a niche Chopra, then you can hang out with
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080]   the Giants.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   They're doing their Hangout.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.920]   I love that.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:50.240]   Jake Ballard, Steve Weatherford, Tyler Sash, Prince and Mukamara.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.800]   And then 20, oh no.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.920]   And then live video chat with Victor Cruz, Corey Webster, Mark Herzlick and Henry Hynoske.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.600]   It'll be just like a sports interview.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   So what's the game?
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.080]   I'm like, well, we're going to try hard to win.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.600]   It's just, they make me be the most.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.080]   We came to win.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   They came to play.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   And you know, you've got to think I'm starting to see now circle on CNN, circle us that Google
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.960]   Plus could be possibly because of Search Plus Your World.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   I have to think it has something to do with that.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.520]   Here's Conan O'Brien talking about.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.320]   I have to show you how much times have changed.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.360]   yesterday, President Obama did a live question and answer session on YouTube.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360]   This is the world we're in now.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.520]   Well, if YouTube is the best forum for the president to appear on, it seems a little
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.800]   less than dignified, but the president did it and take a look.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.920]   Mr. President, welcome to Google Plus.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.640]   Great to talk to you, Steve.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.080]   Mr. President, our first YouTube question today comes from a YouTube celebrity, actually.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.600]   And I think he's someone that you're going to recognize.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   Let's take a look.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:06.680]   This did not happen, by the way.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.000]   Although it should have.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.560]   Keyboard CAD on YouTube.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.280]   Now one thing, the reason I, other reason I played that clip and I think it's kind of
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.200]   interesting is the kind of the conflict, conflibulation, confabulation of YouTube and
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   Google Plus.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Yes.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.840]   That is another trend.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.120]   Does it really, I guess it doesn't hurt Google.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.040]   That's the greatest, the same company.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   It's all Google now.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   Yeah, who care?
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.240]   I mean, I think that's probably a good thing for Google, you know, wouldn't mind that.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.280]   And in fact, it rubs off a little of the magic glitter from YouTube onto Google Plus, right?
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   I think so.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   Here's another.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   Go ahead.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.040]   I believe you could have watched the live stream on YouTube.com versus on Google Plus.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.440]   It's also, I think, across Google Plus.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   That's how I watched it.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.600]   Yeah, it's the same thing.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.000]   Google is clear.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.080]   They're not making a distinction between their services, Google Plus, Google YouTube.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   It's all the same.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.840]   That's the new privacy policy, the whole thing.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.760]   We knew that when they started the Google bar.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.440]   And it just shows you how powerful that is, isn't it?
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.840]   And again, I think it's not the privacy is not a big deal, but there's, I was on an NPR
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.360]   show today with Mark Rotenberg from Epic, and he's insisting this is illegal on what
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   they're doing.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   I don't know.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.840]   Well, on what grounds?
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   Any trust?
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.320]   Uh, that they're changing.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.800]   The people gave them information under one guy's and, and they'd be used to other guys.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.720]   I don't think so, but you know.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.440]   Here's, as long as we're, because this episode is already now banned from YouTube, thanks
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   to that clip.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.840]   So let's just go for it.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:51.560]   Let's just go for it, John Stewart on the daily show, his, his take on the, he calls
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.800]   it the pander express.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.760]   Do you have audio?
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.000]   Let me rewind.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.400]   You, you potted it down probably when I was making noise earlier.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.880]   So let's, let's try that again.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.360]   You're not getting audio.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   Rewind.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.520]   What a, what a retro word.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   I know.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   All right.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.360]   Well, I'll leave it for you to play John Stewart's comments.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   You sure, John?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.800]   Uh, I'm not saying I'm here.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   Huh.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.680]   Can't understand why that would be the case.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.120]   I had that happen to me the other day where I played a YouTube video and suddenly the
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.480]   sound was out and I had to refresh the page and then to play it.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480]   Well, that's the refresh the page.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.360]   Of course, if we refresh the page, we get that once again, that fabulous 10 second commercial
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   commercial.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   For laundry detergent.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   That's great.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.680]   Here's the worst part about all this pandering for votes to speak in Spanish, the singing.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.360]   Once you become president, you have to keep doing it exhibit A while Newton Mint around
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.800]   the campaign trail yesterday.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.680]   Barack Obama was conducting a virtual town hall on Google plus.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Yes.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   Google plus.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   Or as all Gmail users know it, what is that thing up there?
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.200]   Anyway, I can turn that off.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.720]   Actually, I give the president credit for doing a web chat.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.680]   It's a risky move given the likelihood that one of those windows is going to pop up with
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.240]   a shirtless Joe Biden.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.680]   And he's ready to party.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.640]   Huh?
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.480]   During the chat, the president was in full on campaign mode with a warm greeting for every
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   questioner.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.400]   I'm from Port Worth, Texas and I have two beautiful girls.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Nice to meet you.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   You can't be daughters.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:48.760]   I do really have to remind people that they can't beat daughters.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.480]   It seems odd that you would feel compelled to just, you know, I have two beautiful daughters.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.360]   Well, you can't beat them.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.960]   You just can't.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:05.360]   But the chat mostly boiled down to, so Mr. President, help me.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   Sometimes on a surprisingly micro level.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.920]   My husband has an engineering degree with over 10 years of experience and he was laid
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.200]   off three years ago and has yet to find a permanent job in his field.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.040]   If you send me your husband's resume out, I'll just be interested in finding out exactly
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.320]   what's happening right there.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.720]   You've taken resumes, don't you have to do?
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.300]   Do you remember when Jimmy Carter did the same thing many years ago and Saturday Night
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:40.440]   Live got a great bit off where they had Jimmy Carter answering questions in the White House
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.480]   and the Oval Office about everything because Jimmy remember was a nuclear engineer.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.840]   So the whole bit on Saturday Night Live, Mr. President, I'm having trouble with my HVAC,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.400]   my heating system.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.680]   And Jimmy said, well, what you got to do is you got to do it.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   It was a great bit.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   It's exactly.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.920]   So nothing's changed.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.200]   That was 36 years ago.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.640]   Nothing's changed.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.480]   It's just more the same.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:13.600]   It's called retail politics and the social media makes it easy.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   Let's see.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.360]   Giants are going back to the Giants.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.840]   I'm going to see them and go back and forth.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.960]   So if you don't like politics, you got sports.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:28.280]   The Giants are actually using YouTube and Google+ to stream stuff as they arrive in Indianapolis.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:34.080]   I mean, they're really using the medium dramatically, effectively, I think.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.000]   Well, I didn't know the NFL was putting up highlights during the games on its side.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.600]   In fact, you'll be able, this is, I think, the first Super Bowl you'll be able to watch
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.040]   on your phone or your tablet.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   Wow.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   Wow.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   It's not going to be driving, how?
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.920]   Now, this is not recommended, by the way.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.560]   You're driving my wife's life.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.840]   All of my wife's life.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.840]   How?
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   Let your wife drive.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.440]   So if you're on Verizon, there's an NFL app for Verizon phones only that will let you stream
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   the Super Bowl.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.840]   Do you have a Verizon phone?
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840]   You probably do.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   No, that's right.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.040]   We made your buy-in iPhone, didn't we?
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.960]   We made you buy-in life.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.400]   See if you just had that Android phone.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.120]   Let's see, I think it's streaming on the web too, so if you can pull up the web, I wonder
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.320]   if it's flash though.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.160]   Here, let me check, because it is the first Super Bowl that you'll be able to watch on
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.560]   live in high def on Steam.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   Wow.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   Online.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.000]   Let me see here.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   NFL.com is streaming it.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   Smart phone looks like you have to be a Verizon customer, but that's just this year.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   You know, next time.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.760]   They get a little something from Verizon for that.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.560]   I think what you should probably do right now is go to NFL.com on your iPad.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   Wow.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.000]   If you had an Android tablet, no problem, but iPad course, because they don't do flash.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.600]   I wonder how smart NFL is about that.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:11.920]   Are they going to use HTML5 or they're just going to put flash in?
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.080]   We were talking on Twint and we haven't talked about it on this show, but I think we should
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.160]   about the poaching situation.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.560]   Yeah, this is interesting.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.280]   Steve Jobs sent an email to Eric Schmidt, "Bitching."
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.920]   In fact, this has all come out.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.040]   Now, there was a settlement a couple of years ago, the Department of Justice sued these five
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:40.600]   companies, Apple, Google, two-wet, Pixar and Adobe, I think was the fifth, I can't remember,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:47.520]   about colluding not to hire one another's employees, a no-recruit policy, which is illegal.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.960]   I didn't know this, but it's illegal.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.120]   It's antitrust law, prevents companies.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.720]   I can't say to our competitors, like revision three, "Hey, I won't hire your employees if
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   you don't hire them."
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.400]   The reason is it makes perfect sense.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.320]   It prevents a fair market for employees.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   Right.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.560]   You can't say, "Well, I'm going to go across the street and get a better job if you don't
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.960]   give me a raise."
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.160]   And that's exactly by the way, why Google and Apple don't want that to happen.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.440]   They don't want that engineers saying, "I'm going to get a better job."
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:20.240]   So apparently, Apple, now, so there's a class action suit from the employees who say we
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.720]   were discriminated against.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.760]   And so as a result, all of these email exchanges are coming out.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   There was an email exchange in which Steve Jobs asked Eric Schmidt, he said, very politely,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.360]   he said, "I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this."
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.720]   Now, I'm hearing Steve's voice and it's not quite that polite.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:48.360]   I would be very pleased if the scary phrase coming from Jobs, if I got that email from
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   Jobs.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.760]   Now, is this when Schmidt was on the board of Apple?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   Yes, it's 2007.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.000]   And now my other question about this is, is there a difference between poaching employees
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.560]   meaning like, "I'm going to cold call an engineer at Apple and make them an offer to come to
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.120]   Google and an Apple employee coming to Google or applying for a job at Google."
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.320]   Like, isn't this like cold calling or recruiting?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   No.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.280]   This is straight up like we don't hire.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.440]   According to these emails, they were also told if somebody comes to you from Apple and
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.640]   says, "I want a job," you say, "Sorry," and there's some smoking gun emails on this one
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.640]   as well.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.640]   But listen to this.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.040]   So Schmidt took Jobs' email, passed it on to employment, the employment department,
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.560]   saying, "I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   request."
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.600]   In other words, Steve's calling.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   Can you get this stopped?
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.880]   Let me know why this is happening.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.200]   I need to send a response back to Apple quickly.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   Please let me know.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.640]   Eric is jumping.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.360]   Please let me know as soon as you can.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.480]   They fired the Google employee who made the recruitment call.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.560]   Google's staffing director wrote back to Schmidt saying, "Please extend my apologies
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.040]   as appropriate to Steve Jobs.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.520]   It was an isolated incident."
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:12.600]   Jobs said, "We want this firing to be public and we want it to happen immediately."
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.720]   Their picks are same thing.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.960]   Now, what's interesting is if you look at these companies, it's because of their interlocking
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.360]   boards of directors, Google, Apple, Intuit, Bill Campbell, Apple, Board of Director, also
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.720]   Intuit, former Intuit CEO.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.280]   All of this is because it's the Board of Directors going, "Hey, don't worry.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.880]   We're going higher, if you don't hire a hot guy."
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.600]   It's highly illegal.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.320]   They settled this a couple of years ago, but this isn't over.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.520]   When you read it, it's kind of shocking.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.720]   It's also a little insight into how Eric Schmidt was, how far up Steve's Levi's Eric Schwauss.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.480]   It's very different.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   It's very different.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:01.680]   It was tickle on the prostate.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.920]   There's another email between two vice presidents at Google in which they talk about ways to,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.560]   quote, "never get into bidding wars."
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.600]   They CC not only Schmidt but Bill Campbell on the Board at Apple.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.360]   Who was it who was frying the bacon outside Facebook's headquarters to hire people?
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.240]   That was good, wasn't it?
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   Yeah, that was.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.600]   Facebook is not mentioned in this.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.640]   It's just those five that I mentioned.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.600]   I think by the time Facebook became a force, that practice had to be over.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   Thank you to Bacon.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.840]   Did you see the meme on Google+ this week of Bacon Donuts?
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.000]   Ooh, no.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   No.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.920]   I'm going to search plus my world back.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.160]   I am doing it now.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   I am doing it now.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   Searching now.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.240]   That's the greatest to hiring tool I can imagine in the Valley.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.800]   This is actually, let me see.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.320]   This is something else.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.880]   Boy, Bacon is just really huge.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   It is a meme.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.880]   It is the mondo meme.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.360]   I have Bacon every morning for breakfast.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   I've decided.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.360]   Do?
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.600]   I'm on a, I'm on, that's that paleo thing, right?
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.120]   I'm on a no-carb diet, but you're supposed to eat a lot of fat.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.040]   Here's Steve Garfield.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.640]   No, that's not it.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   Is that it?
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   No.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.720]   Google, you're failing me here.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:27.320]   I got the post from Jeff that said he's no longer an optimist about the fate of mankind.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.840]   He's Bacon Donuts look ridiculous.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   Bacon Donuts.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.800]   It's not that Bacon would be, would be baked in, but it's actually sprinkled on the topping.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.880]   See this, I could, so I could eat the top.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   Here it is.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.720]   I could eat the top, but not the bottom.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.880]   Um, Paleo, right.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   God, that looks good.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.680]   That's a cafe dulce.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.800]   So do you just eat like steak for every meal or, or what Leo?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.680]   Well, so when I was eating, I had a delicious meal of chicken and Brussels sprouts and broccoli.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   I eat vegetables.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   Okay.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   Okay.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   Brussels sprouts though.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   Love Brussels sprouts.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   Is that time of year?
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   You know what?
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   You know what?
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.960]   I don't have more time in New York because I would prepare for you Brussels sprouts and
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.480]   bacon with a little balsamic drizzle or something that you would die for.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   It's all in the preparation.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   You've got to braise that.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.080]   I think it's Fukushima cabbage.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   It is cabbage.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.880]   It's little tiny cabbages.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.680]   So it's, it's radioactive.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   That's weird.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.640]   Matt cuts.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.440]   You got to love Matt cuts.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.520]   Look at this article in the search engine land by Matt McGee.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   Matt cuts international diplomat.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.360]   Of course he's a Google and early girl who are going to play in a regular on this show
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.120]   according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.680]   Cuts is in South Korea in a presentation on Monday for about 80 government officials,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   webmasters, lawyers and journalists.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:00.480]   He convinced Korean government reps to let Google crawl and index their websites.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.360]   Can you believe that he's doing?
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:10.600]   He's giving a presentation and one of the senior judge in the Seoul High Court sees in
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.800]   the pre-Mats presentation that the robots.txt file on the courts website prevents the Google
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.520]   bot from crawling it.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.640]   He calls his people, says, Hey, take us out, you know, allow the Google bot in the robot
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   statistics.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   They do it.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.560]   And by the end of the talk, he lets Matt know who will index the site.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.560]   It's crazy.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:36.680]   Kang Min-ku, a senior judge in the Seoul High Court, he actually texted the courts webmaster
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   from the speech, said fix it.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.280]   That's amazing, said Matt, calling an example of Korea's Bali Bali or hurry up culture.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.400]   And he said, I'll use this in my future speeches.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.840]   That's a, that's a nice victory.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   That's kind of cool.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   Matt.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.400]   And, and as, as Wall Street Journal points out, it's a competitive issue for Google.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.960]   If you can't search those sites, you can't deliver those results in your search engine.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.080]   And it's in Google's interest to get everywhere in there.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.200]   Once again, Matt proves himself one of the company's best vocal people.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:18.480]   Now you know why he has carte blanche to go anywhere, say anything, do anything.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:25.360]   So Google's response to our criticisms, Danny Sullivan's criticisms, search engine land
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.880]   about search plus your world is people like it.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.680]   Real, in real people like it.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.200]   Oh, yes, important.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.600]   Not, not you bloggers.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.040]   Popular people, but regular people really like it.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.040]   The data shows.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.640]   Now, I'm not, I'm not making fun.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.800]   I, I just, this interview that Danny did was actually, was very good and very interesting.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.360]   I think that, that it's with a meet, uh, sing hall, who's, right?
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.840]   It looks like he is a manager.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   He's in charge.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.200]   He's Google's search, a chief, it says in the article, Google fellow.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.560]   I think he, I think a meet said I had at least 10 times the product is only two weeks
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.560]   whole.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   Right.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.280]   So he's kind of claiming it on the beta, right?
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.400]   You know, the early beta story, which we get from Google a lot.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.680]   Yeah, that's a great excuse now.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.480]   Hey, we're not done yet.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   Right.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   Right.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   Well, it does look that way.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:20.080]   I went to the Google updated at Davos with Eric Schmidt, David Drummond, uh, Bruce Meyer
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.080]   last weekend.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.160]   One of the reporters there did give them rather holy hell for spamming the results with Google
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.840]   Plus and asking about antitrust and not much news came out of this at all.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.160]   But I found it interesting that David Drummond, the council, um, repeated more than once the,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   the idea that, uh, I see if I can get the quote here was that a search engine is not
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.400]   going to be 10 blue links forever.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   Ah, interesting.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   And it really is to me.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   So we should answer a user's question and ask for antitrust.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.480]   He said, how exactly we foreclosed anybody else for anybody from using anyone else's
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   competitive service.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:59.200]   We're not nothing in antitrust law says or should say that we have to be 10 blue links.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.520]   So I, I smell in that the, the idea that they're going to, you know, start messing with search.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.520]   Right.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.840]   Uh, and this is the way they have already, but I think they're going to mess with a lot
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   more ways.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:16.080]   And it's also a crafting or pre saging their defense, right?
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   Yes.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   Oh, sure.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   Sure.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.520]   Um, really, really interesting.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.600]   Um, you know, so their defense is now several parts.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:35.840]   One is nothing makes us nothing requires us, uh, to just be search results, but I don't
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   think it responds to, I think the, the, perhaps, and I'm not a lawyer.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:45.080]   So I don't know, but I would guess antitrust would say that, now it's, see, Google's not
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   a monopoly yet.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   So that's really the real reason.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   They're only 65%.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   But let's say they were a monopoly.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.400]   Let's say they were 90% or 95%.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.440]   Which they are in some European countries.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:00.200]   Uh, if you are a monopoly could, it seems to me very analogous to the Microsoft issue.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.880]   If you're a monopoly, are you allowed to favor your sites in the search results?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.360]   It would be like, in my mind, again, I'm not an attorney, my mind, it would be like Microsoft
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.240]   favoring Internet Explorer.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.520]   Of course you can use other browsers, uh, on Windows, but they gotten a lot of trouble
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.640]   by bundling Internet Explorer in.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.880]   Uh, it would be like that.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   Yes.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.180]   Of course you could use another search engine or massage your results, but you are favoring
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.180]   your own product.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:35.360]   See, look at this, see, Facebook doesn't get this because Facebook is one integrated whole.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.580]   If, if Google didn't acquire these things and add, you know, Google plus and add YouTube
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.760]   and so on and so forth, if they don't, if they've been born whole, right, then it's
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.400]   just part of Google.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.040]   The only reason that we taxonomically argue that Google plus is different from Google
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.680]   search or YouTube is different from Google search because they got added later.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Right.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.700]   So, um, I'm not making this as a legal argument at all, but I'm just saying that, that I think
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:05.140]   that they're in a different position than their competitors are like Facebook.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.660]   Facebook obviously promotes its own stuff and only its own stuff.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.660]   Right.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:16.100]   Uh, and, and Google now, especially with that and the privacy stuff we talked about last
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.580]   week, uh, it puts them in a more difficult position.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.580]   I don't know how they're going to argue it.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.580]   We'll see.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.400]   Yeah, we shall see.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.860]   Um, they're not a monopoly.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.000]   So the right now they can do anything.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Okay.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.600]   So they can do anything.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.220]   I mean, the thing, the thing that whether or not they can do something legally for me
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.220]   is in the question.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.220]   Oh, I agree.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.040]   And I think I agree with the MG Seagler who said it hurts the results.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.840]   That's the, that's the, that's the question.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.600]   I mean, it's, I mean, it's the question for me is, is it good for, is it good for the user,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   right?
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   Like is, is Google serving the user?
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.440]   And that's what it means saying serve.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.440]   Right.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.580]   He's saying that it does.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.900]   I have a really hard, I really go back and forth about this.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.540]   I have a really hard time believing that given the focus on the user work, you know, given,
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:08.100]   given the idea that the Google knows about the other social media presence is of different,
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.220]   of people that, you know, cause, celebrities and popular people that you might search for.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.060]   And the fact that they choose to show the favorite, to show Google plus over those other
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.260]   sites and I get that they don't have the data.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.340]   That's hard for me to believe because Google has a lot of data.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.480]   They've been really successful getting data from the web for years and years.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.560]   And I just, I don't have time for that.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.240]   So, I mean, I think whether or not they can really isn't the question that bothers me
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   about it.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.480]   It's whether or not, whether or not they should.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   Sure.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.720]   I asked them about the, about the Twitter fire hose as well.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.640]   And they lamented that they believe that they had a really good deal before and Marissa
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.200]   made that deal originally.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.620]   They said they wanted the deal to happen.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.120]   It didn't happen after much negotiation.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.380]   And I said, okay, well, what caused, what were the issues?
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.460]   And then they wouldn't answer.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.460]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.460]   Hey speaking.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.460]   Speak it.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.460]   Go ahead.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.460]   You speak.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.180]   At some point, I'm not going to hijack the show again, don't worry.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.220]   But at some point, I would love to hear your reaction of YouTube is I'm still cannot figure
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.820]   out what I think about the Twitter or sensory and by nation thing.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.820]   Good.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.820]   Let's do that now.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.820]   And then I'll mention Facebook.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:16.580]   I should tell everybody that Cara Swisher says, go the F back to sleep.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.640]   It's not going to happen till after the markets close, which is in the next two minutes, the
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.880]   Facebook filing and I have, and I have it right here.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:32.960]   And I'm refreshing again and again the Facebook filings on the SEC and to date no filing
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.440]   for an IPO, but it could happen in the next few minutes.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.760]   So I will watch this with great.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.720]   I'm refreshing Google news.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.320]   I'll have it first.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.020]   I've got the SEC site up here.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.400]   So let's talk about that.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.640]   Twitter is announced that it will end.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.280]   This to me is to me a little analogous to what Google went through in China that it
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:01.060]   will adhere to the laws of various nations and allow those nations to censor tweets.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.720]   And it seems to me that this is exactly what you have to do.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.140]   If you're going to be in a country, you have to adhere to that country's laws, we wouldn't
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.900]   like it very much.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:14.640]   If a site from another nation in the US did adhere to US laws, we'd have to do something
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.340]   like SOPA.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:24.100]   And similarly, if you're in Germany or France, for instance, it's illegal to tweet Nazi propaganda,
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.100]   right?
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.620]   Yeah, I talked to somebody from Google about this and I tried to understand on a level
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:34.460]   of principle here, which is what I don't quite understand about the Twitter thing, the
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.500]   analogy to Google and was told that in France and Germany, they are given a list of sites
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.780]   by the government.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.740]   These are illegal sites, blocks them.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.740]   Right.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.740]   And they're like to them.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.120]   Whereas in China, I said, okay, what's the difference with that in China?
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.600]   In China, they were never given a list.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.760]   And so they would try to cry.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.720]   They would actually crawl to find out what they could.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   Right.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   That's tough.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   And that's what they put up.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.160]   So they became a dirtier thing in their view.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.440]   And so Google was censoring things kind of on its own, on the presumption of what China
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   was doing.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   And it sounds like a fairly fine line, but they're still aligned there somewhere.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.080]   The Twitter thing got to, you know, grasp the different reactions.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   And I really don't know.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.800]   It's a rare moment when I say I don't know what to think about it, but I don't.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.140]   On the one hand, slippery slope of censorship, you're doing the government's bidding low
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.320]   and blah, blah, blah, but you're right, Leo, and given country what are you going to do.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.640]   However, they're not in China.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.940]   Is this a way cynically to get them into China is the negative argument?
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.680]   The positive argument is as far as I can tell.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   Well, no.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   Right.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.560]   So that's the problem is this is just a cynical move to get you in.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.520]   And I was with some Chinese activists who were absolutely irate about this.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.320]   We're very unhappy.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.520]   Even though they don't have Twitter now, they felt that it was it was pandering to the government.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.400]   On the other hand, the tweets that don't appear in country acts will appear in the rush to
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   the world.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.160]   So is that as someone put it, and I wish I remember who I think was read right, web,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.520]   said, you know, I, I Reuters said it was a gray box of shame, not for Twitter, but for
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.600]   the governments that then becomes publicized around the world.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.560]   And I just cannot get my head around whether this is a good or bad move.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.680]   So let me understand that.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:19.160]   So if I am in Germany and I tweet pro white supremacist, Nazi tweet, Twitter will block
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   it in Germany, but will not, but will not.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.400]   So they won't block it at the source.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.640]   They won't say, no, you can't post that.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.600]   They will just block it in Germany and not block it everywhere else.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   That's what I understand.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   I could be wrong.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.040]   Chat room, please, please correct me.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   And also we know, I mean, that's kind of a.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.040]   We don't know.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.320]   Part of what, what Google was, what was this Google was saying too, was that if they did
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.160]   it on words, that would be a bad thing.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.200]   If they just preemptively wouldn't let you publish certain words, that would be a bad
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   thing.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   And I, and I certainly agree with that.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.400]   I think that's censorship at all is.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:56.000]   Well, we know now that you should never tweet the words destroy America.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Did you see that?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I'm embarrassed.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Yeah, I'm too.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.480]   To be honest, I'm embarrassed.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.240]   Look, I understand the need to protect this country against terrorists, but not.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.680]   Wait, I didn't hear that story.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   Okay.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:18.040]   Well, two British tourists, Lee Van Brian and I guess his girlfriend coming to the US.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.960]   Emily Banting tweeted.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.600]   This guy Lee tweeted, Melissa free this week for a quick, quick gossip prep before I go
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.840]   and destroy America.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:36.840]   He tipped the Department of Homeland Security when the pair arrived at LAX.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.720]   They were detained by armed guards.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:51.440]   He was handcuffed and thrown into a cell with Mexican drug dealers for 12 hours flagged
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.440]   as a potential threat to our shores and then prevented.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.960]   They were both prevented.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.520]   Oh, oh, there was another tweet.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.640]   Which was quoting the family guy, but apparently the DHS doesn't watch the family guy.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.680]   Three weeks ago, we're totally in LA people off on Hollywood, Boulevard and digging Maryland
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.240]   Monroe up.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:18.000]   They actually searched his suitcase looking for shovels thinking that they were looking
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.880]   to raid Maryland's tomb.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.480]   If you are in the UK, you know, the destroy is common slang for like rip it up, you know,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.120]   have a have a great time.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.240]   He said, I almost burst out laughing when they asked me if I was going.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.840]   This is his girlfriend said, I almost burst out laughing when they asked me if I was going
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.040]   to be Lee's lookout while he dug up Maryland Monroe.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:48.440]   They asked me why we wanted to destroy America and we tried to explain it meant to get trashed
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.080]   and party and spend money here and create jobs for bartenders.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.240]   So they were not allowed to enter because of tweets.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.920]   So don't just a word.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.840]   We have a large international contingent.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.480]   If you plan to come to the US, please watch your tweets.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:11.080]   Watch your you know, to get back to the Twitter, the Twitter blocking censorship per country,
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.960]   the one thing that I think that they did very right is that they're actually going to list
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   in the API.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.040]   So when you request tweets that have been blocked in certain countries via the Twitter
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:25.480]   API, the payload will actually specify which countries certain tweets were withheld in.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   Right.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.760]   So this means that programmatically developers can make apps which show the tweets that were
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.840]   censored around the world.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.840]   Wow.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.840]   So that's pretty powerful.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   That is very powerful.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.160]   Go to go to chilling effects.org.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.520]   You can watch as it happens.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Exactly.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.560]   So, you know, that's that's that is pretty powerful stuff.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.760]   I think that that's that can be used as a tool to stop censorship.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   You can argue that.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.880]   So I'm coming to go on that side, but you know, just like Google, I don't think they
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.320]   did a great job of explaining and announcing the rationale.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.520]   Maybe they didn't want to because maybe there is, you know, politics behind it.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.920]   But but we're all going to tear apart these decisions and try to figure them out pretty
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.120]   quickly.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.200]   And after China, Google and after some of these other things, we want to find out what's
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.000]   good and bad.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.920]   So thank you for the help.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   I think that you just I mean, it's the reason Google stopped being in China.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.800]   You have to adhere to the laws of the country.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   You operate it.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:30.480]   I mean, I understand that that's not, you know, that that seems reprehensible to us in
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.200]   this country because we support supposedly support free speech.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.360]   Apparently not, but supposedly support free speech.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.400]   But I think I think the company has to have principles and it has to state where those
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.400]   principles are.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.800]   So Facebook, if Facebook gets the point and they've had talks with China, if they say
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.680]   at some point, okay, we're going into China and yes, we'll require real identity and yes,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.880]   we'll pass that on to the authorities.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.880]   Does that make Facebook evil?
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:01.560]   And so, you know, we're going to expect these companies to say what their principles are
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.760]   in these activities.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   That was the issue with Google and China.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.440]   Well, I think making the API is a very good clear state.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.440]   Very good.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   All right.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.200]   We'll do we'll comply with the laws of the country, but we'll do it in such a way that
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.560]   it's completely transparent to everybody else is perfect.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.400]   That's a great response, I think.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.760]   I didn't think that got as much coverage as it should.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   I like your address.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.600]   That's the fields are withheld scope withheld in countries.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.840]   So something withheld in Greece, Hong Kong, Amalasia would say withheld countries, GR,
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.000]   HK, and why.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   I would say let's generalize from that, that that's a great rule of thumb that you follow
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.800]   the laws in the country that requires it, but that you also support the free flow of
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.480]   information everywhere else.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   Right.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.280]   And you're completely transparent about what you.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.280]   Yes.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   What you've held back and where.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   I think that's a pretty good solution.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.280]   Mm hmm.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.960]   Now, of course, you couldn't do that in the United States.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.800]   If you got one of the secret subpoenas here, right?
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   Mm hmm.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.040]   You know, you had a great, I thought a very interesting conversation and email.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.200]   Can I talk about it with this?
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   Sure.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   Fellow from Germany.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.880]   Yeah, just where he is one is idea out.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.840]   No names.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.800]   But what at first I thought was a flame, to be honest, mostly because of the subject line,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:23.080]   was really a very thoughtful piece about, because as we all know, Jeff, who is an honorary
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:28.400]   German and spends a lot of time in Germany and speaks German, has talked a lot about
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.080]   how this, this obsession for privacy in some ways in Germany.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.120]   And he said, well, you know, look at the Patriot Act.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.320]   He's right.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:45.520]   The privacy regulations that we were talking about last week that are proposed in the EU
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:51.520]   are in many ways protecting individuals and comparing contrast to our own laws here in
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:45:00.000]   the States, whereas in fact, individuals are, we could find out whatever we want.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.520]   And no one can say a word.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.600]   And, you know, what he also had the point of is there are so many unintended consequences.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.400]   And I saw this and I went to a meeting on privacy at Davos after I took over the show
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.760]   last week on the topic and don't worry, I won't do it again.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:22.120]   But one software services company said that they got a request from a European client
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   to give them unlimited protection from liability.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.440]   And the software services company wasn't involved in anything having to do with privacy.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:35.000]   But if they got a core dump from a frozen machine, sent over to them as hexadecimal just
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.440]   data to try to figure out why the machine had crashed.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:44.960]   And in that hexadecimal somewhere in the core dump was some private information, then there's
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   liability involved.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.360]   Even though they're not going to do with it, it has nothing to do with what they do, but
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.600]   it got transferred across and oh my God, what are we going to do?
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.160]   And that's the problem we get now with various regimes trying to regulate the internet at
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.600]   one level or another.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:04.720]   And there are so many unintended consequences of doing it that I just still see danger, danger,
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   danger.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.000]   So from our chat room comes a story.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.240]   I've always thought that the, and it's always been thought that the antivirus companies perhaps
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:21.920]   overstated the risks, security risks from viruses to promote their products.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.560]   Symantec has now backtracked from assertions last week that 13 Android apps on the Android
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.920]   marketplace were malicious.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.280]   It now says, oh, whoops, no, that's just, it's just an ad network.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   Symantec.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:42.760]   Symantec found code within 13 apps called Android.counterclank and said, oh, it's a Trojan
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.840]   horse, it's malware.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.240]   In fact, it is not.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.680]   It is, it's completely legitimate code.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:59.800]   Comes from an SDK distributed to third parties to help to monetize applications through search.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   And look out, as said this all along, Symantec now acknowledges.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.320]   It's aggressive, but it is, it's not exactly malware.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.640]   It's changing the homepage.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.600]   Now this actually I think is malware.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:18.520]   It changes the homepage of your browser and adds some shortcuts to your phone's home page.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.360]   And it may add and remove bookmarks.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.880]   So it sounds kind of malicious.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:30.160]   I'm not calling it a Trojan horse, but it is a little something you don't want on there.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.400]   It sounds like crap where.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.960]   Crap where, thank you.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.440]   The technical term.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.040]   The technical term is crap where teenagers now may use Google plus.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.480]   I didn't know they couldn't before.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.880]   You had to be 18, 21.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.880]   Yep.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   Yep.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:51.120]   So this is, this is definitely a nod to Facebook, right?
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.920]   If you want teenagers, that means you want the Facebook.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.920]   No.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.760]   Started on Thursday, teens and young adults says Bradley horror.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.440]   What's are the most active internet users on the planet and surprise, surprise?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.160]   They're also human beings.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.000]   Those of us where the parents of teenagers might dispute that.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:16.240]   But minors can now use Google plus, but there are some security changes that Google plus
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.520]   is implemented with that in mind.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.640]   I presume not below 13, right?
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   Yeah, I would get because of the copa.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.280]   13 is the key.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.640]   Anybody was old enough for a Google account of any sort can get Google plus.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:39.600]   That means 13 years old in the US, in Spain, 14 South Korea, 14 in the Netherlands, 16,
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.760]   13 almost everywhere else, just like Facebook, 13 and up.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   So they're going to change.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.160]   Online sharing is still second rate for this age group, he says.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:56.240]   In life, for instance, teens can share the right things with just the right people over.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.080]   So I guess they're limiting the circles.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.720]   They have to share to their.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.040]   Well, you can't share to public.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.360]   Yeah, some of the defaults are different.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   I'm not.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.400]   That's a good question.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:17.920]   If you can't share by default, only those in teens circles can say hello to those teens.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.480]   So I guess it's not outbound.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   It's inbound.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   Okay.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   Well, that's appropriate.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.840]   In fact, I'd like that.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.840]   Exactly.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   We've got that.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.720]   That's Bob Weiman's argument about email is that the recipient should control.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   Right.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:37.720]   And the thing is that the teenager is in full control and will not get on stuff from one
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:38.720]   one of the people.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.720]   That's not a bad.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   Hey, I want that.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.600]   Yeah, it sounds like a good feature.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:48.000]   Actually you can't that features a click away for everybody and for teenagers to.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.480]   And if you're in a hang of teenagers in a hangout that someone who is not in their circles joins,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.240]   the teenager automatically gets booted from the hangout.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:59.240]   Well, no, well, not booted, but there's just a little they go off camera and there's
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.240]   a notification.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.760]   Hey, there's someone else has joined.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.800]   Do you want to rejoin?
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.560]   So it's yeah, kind of interesting.
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   I guess that's okay.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.080]   I don't mind that.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   Stranger, stranger alert.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.000]   Yeah, which is which is data boys.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.200]   All right, but we've been every adult.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   Dangerous.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.280]   But I guess, but they got it.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.080]   It's kind of it's kind of cover their butts.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   Yeah, minor.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.680]   There's a higher likelihood of penises on webcams.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   Anything.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   Yes.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   I mean, yes.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   Look at Joe Biden.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   Look at that bluntly.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.680]   No, joking.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   That's a show.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:38.040]   Joe Biden has never showed his penis on a webcam to my knowledge.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   Shirtless Biden.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   Shirtless.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   That was funny.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   That was funny.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.040]   Good.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   I like Joe Biden.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   He's not.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.040]   He's never done that.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.120]   I'm looking to still know filing from Facebook.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.280]   The markets are closed now.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:56.760]   So maybe maybe they will, but Edgar search results on the SEC site for Facebook.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.400]   Show nothing.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:06.240]   I think that they say that F what would be the the clicker.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   What do they call it?
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   The clicker.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   The right.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   The ticker symbol.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:15.480]   The joke here was like, huh?
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   Like or poke.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.080]   Poke would be good.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   No.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.080]   Would you?
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.840]   I think that would be very good.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.680]   F.B. is available on all exchanges.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.120]   Do we even know whether it's NASDAQ or NYC?
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.960]   No, we don't.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:36.400]   You know that they bid both NYC and NASDAQ try very hard to get those guys on there.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.040]   The New York Stock Exchange.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.440]   Apple's always been on the over the counter NASDAQ exchange.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.000]   New York Stock Exchange very famously went to Apple said, we'll give you a single letter
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.160]   if you come over here and they never did.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.520]   A lot of value in this Facebook.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.520]   We can't.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.880]   I don't and I'm pretty sure you guys don't buy stock, tech stocks.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.800]   No, actually you do.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   You knew you do.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   I do.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   I do.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   I've been transferred about.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   In fact, I chose to buy a little Google so I had some skin in the game.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   Just so I'd watch them.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   So would you buy some Facebook?
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   Would you try to get in on this?
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.720]   Well, I don't think I can get the F on the IPO.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.600]   But at some point I would like to buy some Facebook.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.920]   It occurred to me.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:17.920]   I wrote a piece for The Guardian.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   I think we'll have tomorrow.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:24.200]   It occurred to me that Facebook has a staff size of a large newspaper which at most might
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.800]   have a million audience.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.680]   Of course, it serves a billion people.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.640]   It's a pretty damn good business.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.160]   You know, it really is.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:38.360]   It's so darn efficient and the engagement is so high and the data value is so high.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:44.240]   And even I saw Nikesh Aurora from Google at DLD in Munich before it almost last week.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.440]   And he was talking about how we moved from the information age to the people age.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.200]   This is Google talking.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.600]   It's Google talking.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   Yes.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:55.040]   And that to me puts Facebook at a rather prevalent position strategically.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:01.480]   Now the irony is, of course, I don't actually use Facebook as much as I used to.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.800]   But that's just me and I am right here.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   That's just you.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   It is.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.480]   Everybody else uses it 10 times more.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.720]   You know, I had a really interesting conversation with my 17 year old son last night in which
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.960]   he was very clear that Facebook's intent was to get them, get him and all his friends
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.520]   to not use the internet just to use Facebook.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   He said, oh, yeah.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   I said, because you don't use email.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.520]   I said, I send you email.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.520]   You never see it.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   He said, you got to Facebook me.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.200]   He said, Facebook, everybody uses Facebook messaging.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.600]   He says, everybody's using Facebook for I am for Skype.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.720]   Facebook has its own currency.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.860]   How long before Facebook currency is the is a global world currency that supersedes
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.400]   the dollar in the euro?
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.280]   And finally, right now Facebook doesn't sell much.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.960]   We both agreed that we still would go to Amazon to buy something.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:54.840]   But how long before you buy everything on Facebook too?
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.440]   I'm sure Mark will launch that.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.960]   Well, that's that's that goes back to the vision of beacon and of blippy and things like
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.880]   that is when you know what your friends buy.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   Right.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.800]   Let it all and of course we got 800 million users who spend all their time on Facebook.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.520]   We had a great discussion on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:19.000]   I'll be curious what you guys think that if it weren't if Facebook did not exist, we
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.880]   would all be using the Internet less.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   And I said, well, how much less?
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:30.160]   He said, well, let's say 20%, they're not maybe not a, you know, 100% but but a significant
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.280]   less amount of time spent on the Internet if it weren't for Facebook.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.920]   And I said, oh, if Facebook didn't exist, we would have had to invent it.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   Something would have done that.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.080]   Maybe when you're on Facebook, are you actually on the Internet?
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   I'm being a little facetious.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.840]   Well, that was what Jennifer.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   Okay.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.840]   So we're at having this conversation.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   My wife's at the table as well.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.800]   She said, well, Facebook and the I mean, you have to use the Internet to use Facebook.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   Right?
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.440]   I said, yeah, well, you're still on the Internet, but you're in Facebook's little walled garden
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.440]   of the Internet.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:03.120]   Yeah, I feel pretty passionate about keeping the web decentralized and not spending all
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.360]   your time within certain walls.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:11.520]   The idea of Facebook currencies to proceeding, that's just deeply depressing to me personally.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.760]   Don't you think it could happen?
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.880]   If they start selling stuff, they've got a they've got Facebook credits, Facebook currency
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.880]   already.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.640]   Facebook currency probably has a better chance than Bitcoin.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   Right.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:28.880]   But you know, I've been seeing those Facebook currency gift cards at like Target.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:29.880]   They sell them like that.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.200]   They sell them at stores for a while, but I never hear anything about it or people actually
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.520]   using it.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.080]   I just, you know, I just don't see a lot of stories about it.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.520]   Just kind of in the in tech news.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.720]   I mean, the kids buying these and using them.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.800]   Yeah, they use them for like farmville and stuff.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.120]   But right now I don't think there's much you can use it.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.800]   But what if they started selling real goods on Facebook?
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.440]   And you know, I mean, or or and this is more Facebooky.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.360]   They did a deal with Amazon, let's say.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:04.320]   Well, I think Facebook is going to, you know, Facebook and Google both know where we are.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:10.200]   And that's and local commerce, I think is going to become a matter of instant gratification
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.760]   at a premium.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:18.560]   And otherwise, commerce is consolidated and distributed from a distance Amazon.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.920]   And so they're both going to try to tell us that thing you want, here's the best way
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   to get it.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   You can get it right now here.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.720]   You can get it wherever you want there.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.720]   And Amazon.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.720]   Hmm.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.720]   I don't know.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.720]   I don't know.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.520]   What if I were Amazon?
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.520]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.520]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   That's the that's the.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.520]   See, this is where Facebook has this great negotiate.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.960]   Like, yeah, all we want is for people to live.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:40.960]   We there's two things we want to Facebook.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.960]   We won't charge Amazon.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.440]   All we want is for people to live in Facebook and we just want the social signals back.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   We just want to know what they buy.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   Yes.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.440]   It's right.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   Yes.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   Now, I don't think Jeff Bay, I think that's valuable.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   Everybody knows now how much and that's why Apple would not do a deal with Facebook.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.440]   That's what happened to Ping.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.880]   Up to surprise you, as Apple said, you can't have that information.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.840]   And Facebook said, well, that's all we ask.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.880]   And so, I think that's a good thing.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   I said, you can't have that information.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:13.360]   But how long before the value of having a living on Facebook becomes so great that
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.920]   you that it's worth it?
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.400]   Facebook and Google are both.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.600]   I said it a million times in the show that they're both in a single generation.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:25.520]   And so, if you look at the news reader that Guardian and Washington Post and the Wall
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.560]   Street Journal have on Facebook, that's valuable to both.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.480]   But I don't know is how much data is passed from Facebook back to those media companies.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.480]   Right.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.760]   How do they know who's reading what?
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.720]   But content's primary value was going to be a single generation.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.720]   Right.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.720]   And Facebook knows it.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.720]   Right.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   And people aren't willing.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   And people, everybody knows it now.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.720]   So, nobody's willing to give it away.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.720]   Facebook, I predict, watch, I predict.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.760]   We'll need to, we'll need to watch this.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.600]   Facebook needs a stick along with the carrot.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.960]   So the carrot, there's lots of carrots.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.680]   We have 800 million people.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.680]   You know.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.040]   So, a billion.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.800]   We'll have our own currency and we'll give those people 5% off if they use Facebook currency,
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   whatever.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.720]   You know, there's ways, there's lots of carrots.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   Facebook needs a stick.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   Remember, Apple's stick was you're going to rob blind with piracy.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.440]   So you got to sell your stuff in iTunes because what, you know, that's going to save you.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:19.600]   There needs to be some, something pushing Amazon into using Facebook.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.400]   Maybe, and maybe search, maybe this is why Google's so threatened.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.760]   Maybe search is it.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:32.320]   If Facebook search for goods is superior because of the social signals, it can apply to it.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.880]   Maybe that's a way, you know, hey, if you don't participate with us, you won't show
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.640]   up on our search.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.240]   Certainly that's what Google is.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.960]   This is why it's in antitrust issue on Google.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.840]   Google has a stick now.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   There's search results.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.960]   Well, we're going to favor YouTube.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.280]   We might not see your results so high up on the page unless you, you know, do something
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   for us.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.400]   That's, I mean, that's what you do, right?
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.680]   When you control a market, I've got it.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:05.520]   Leo, Leo, the movie, the Google father, the father, the father.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.080]   That's the benefit.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.640]   Someday and then they may never come.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.840]   I will ask of you a favor.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:20.040]   Facebook, according to Bloomberg has picked Morgan Stanley to lead the IPO.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.640]   I do think they're going to file today.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   That's what everybody says.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.880]   Are they still haven't filed to keep checking?
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.320]   The amount is unknown between five and $10 billion.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:33.280]   They're saying whatever amount comes out is just going to be a placeholder.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.840]   They're going to adjust it later based on the pricing.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.160]   Do you think they'll do what Google did, the Dutch auction?
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   That was smart.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.840]   I would, you know, God, I wish they would do something that would be different.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.400]   But if they're going to give two and a half percent to the likes of Morgan Stanley, it's
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.920]   the same old, same old.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   Yeah, that was Bill Hamburg.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.880]   I mean, how wonderful would it be?
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.920]   The people who made Facebook Facebook are the members of Facebook.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   Right.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.720]   And give it to us.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:03.640]   For them to have a piece of the company would be the greatest symbolic thing you could imagine,
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.920]   to find a way to do that.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.720]   God knows they're on SEC rules, but it just would be so cool.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.880]   Wouldn't that be cool to give it 800 million shares to the Facebook users?
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.360]   Maybe there's a stick in there somewhere.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.560]   Come back with our, unless you guys have another story you want to cover, there are
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.840]   a few more in our rundown that we haven't gotten to.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.520]   But if not, we will come back with our tool tip and number of the week.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.640]   We got duck, duck go setting new traffic records.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.840]   I know, I know.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.440]   You know what's cool about duck, duck go.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.160]   It publishes its traffic charts.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.960]   Like it's public is traffic charts.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.680]   And since the search plus your world stuff, or actually, sorry, since the privacy policy
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.600]   changes, it's gone through the roof and it's gone through the roof and it's still going
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   through the roof.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.600]   Does duck go use Google?
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.920]   Even that it does use some of Google signals, but its wholesale is that it's private.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   It's private.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   It's a private.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.080]   So it would be a way of using Google without telling Google what you're doing.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.560]   Right, without telling Google what you're doing.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   And they do publish.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.480]   This is from duck.go.com/traffic.html.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:18.600]   But queries per day have jumped skyrocketed, but it's still only like 700,000 a day.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600]   It's not.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.120]   Yeah, I mean, it's not anything.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.320]   You know, I thought I put the story up there and I thought it was interesting because there's
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.280]   a post I put in the rundown.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.560]   It's by a former Googler.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.120]   You know, last week we debated the question about whether or not Google has become evil.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.600]   But Nelson, who's a former Googler said, you know, that that's not the right question
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600]   to ask.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.440]   The only question asked is Google still as deserving of our love as it used to be.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   Oh, wow.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   And he says no, right?
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.040]   And he says that he doesn't feel like it does and that he's going to spend the time
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.320]   that he would have spent, you know, explaining and defending Google, focusing on interesting
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.600]   plucky upstarts who are trying to do something different.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.760]   That Google has become so big and so powerful and so entrenched and has proven itself kind
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.440]   of clueless recently with a few different moves.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.280]   So, you know, the privacy policy announcement and search plus your world and Nimwors, the
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.120]   Macality thing that there have been just so many.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.160]   There's a laundry list of things that Google has done wrong, whether or not they did it
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.280]   maliciously or just because they're sort of clueless or it came off the wrong way that
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.120]   he wants to focus on kind of smaller upstarts.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.040]   And I got to tell you that that really kind of got to me.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.840]   So I think it's interesting that DuckDuckGo is doing something different and hooking itself
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.160]   on the privacy issue.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.680]   I think that, you know, all of us type very personal things into our search engines every
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   day.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.640]   And in fact, a friend of mine who listens to the show kind of called me out and said,
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.400]   you know, you all said that the privacy policy change wasn't as big a deal as people made
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.360]   it out to be, but you didn't spend enough time talking about how much data we really
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.960]   do shovel into Google every day.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.560]   And I thought that was maybe, you know, a fair, you know, a fair comment and he uses
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   DuckDuckGo every day.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.120]   So, you know, Sui is, I put it in the rundown because I thought it was an interesting
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   one.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.320]   So many of the chat rooms says Linux Mint uses the Firefox and Linux Mint is configured
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.680]   to use DuckDuckGo by default, which is interesting.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   By default.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.000]   I'm actually thinking about switching to DuckDuckGo just, you know, just to try it out to see
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   how it goes.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Here's the deal.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.840]   If the chat room is right, they use the Yahoo API, which means you're using Bing.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   Okay.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   Okay.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:24.240]   And absolutely Microsoft sharing signals with Facebook.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.880]   Absolutely.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   But do they know who you are?
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.880]   I mean, I guess it depends on how it might be.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.200]   You don't because you're not signed in.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.200]   Right.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   Right.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200]   Right.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.680]   So if you want to search anonymously on Google, you have to open up an incognito window or
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.560]   you have to sign out of your Google account, which is to me is a big deal because I'm in
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560]   Gmail all day.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560]   Right.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.520]   I actually don't feel so bad about keeping my email with Google because that's, those
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.040]   are messages that I'm sending to humans.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.920]   Those are messages that I'm assuming that anyone can see.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.720]   It's the search engine stuff, you know, where I feel like I'm just having this private
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.040]   conversation with a machine.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.680]   I shouldn't have said private, but I'm having a conversation with a machine about my inner
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680]   most thoughts and concerns.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680]   Oh, and you can tell.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.240]   You know, you search for psoriasis, you know, you're telling the world, right?
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.560]   I mean, it's really amazing what your search history can really.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.560]   I mean, if you look, if you turn your log on and just look through the past couple of
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.560]   months, you're like, oh, you know, it's the guide to what's been going on in your head,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.920]   less so than your email or, you know, even, even maybe I am conversations.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.360]   Anyway, I didn't think it's a hijack.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.200]   I want to do it for the, let's do it for the next week and see.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   And see how it goes.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.200]   Jeff, I want to hear your rebuttal.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.200]   I knew that this would be Jeff bait.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.680]   It's so easy.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.840]   It's so simple.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.560]   So what if you have psoriasis?
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.600]   I mean, I guess come back to that.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.040]   You can, I was on an NPR show that this morning and some woman had typed you diabetes and she
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.640]   got mad that they were giving her ads and I'm kind of saying, okay, but why?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.640]   What's the harm to you that they give you ads that might actually be useful and relevant?
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.800]   We're still in this world of creepiness.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   Like what?
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.520]   I don't want people to take my picture.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.280]   It takes my soul.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.120]   It's we've got to get down to the real harm at some level and not have this discussion
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.400]   up here in creepy land.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   That's all.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.400]   That's reasonable.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.400]   That's reasonable.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.760]   But coming from a place of, I mean, you know, if you're a gay teen or a woman who's
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.120]   getting pregnant, I get that.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:21.400]   But then even then, if Google revealed our data in such things, the, you know, it would
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.040]   plummet the value of the company.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   Right.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.440]   And I said that they actually filter this behavioral data that they use to inform, to
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.520]   inform other products that they filter it for health and other sensitive topics.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.440]   I have no idea how they do that.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:40.560]   Well, and under the rules, health, all health data gets a special treatment, which, you
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.880]   know, is an unfortunate for society.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.400]   But I think I'm still going to say the reason why.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.920]   But I don't know if I said this last week, what I met with the Google engineers at Google
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.480]   and Munich where they do the privacy stuff, they said that after all that street view stuff
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.360]   and everything else, they haven't heard any burps about priority inbox.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:01.080]   And priority inbox is reading your email and making judgments about that, doing all these
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.080]   things about who matters to you and who doesn't.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.920]   But it's so useful that everybody ignores all the creepy problems.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   Right.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.920]   It's true.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   Priority inbox is really pretty great.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.160]   And I have never given it another thought.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160]   Okay.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.160]   Okay.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.160]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   No, that's good.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   I would.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.880]   There was one other now.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:24.040]   And now you got me started.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.000]   There was one other story I wanted to do.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.240]   Oh, the crunchies.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.920]   I forgot to mention Google Plus was the best social network on the Tech Crunch Crunchy Awards
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920]   yesterday.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.480]   And it was booed.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.880]   I heard two boos.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.720]   You know, somebody wrote an article and said there was boo.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.720]   I don't think I wasn't there, but we're there.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   A lot of booze.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.880]   They were mocking Google Plus, you know, in that stand.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.520]   Why would you boo Google Plus?
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.400]   No, but I thought it was interesting that they were mocking it during the monologue or
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.400]   whatever.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400]   And then it won the award.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   And then I read this article that said that there were booze.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.760]   I was like, wow, Google Plus is really the butter jokes in the Valley.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.200]   Well, listen to what the competition was in best social application.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.680]   Facebook timeline, Instagram, the new Twitter or path.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.880]   I think Google Plus in that group.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.680]   I think Google Plus is pretty impressive.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.360]   Gina, how many I don't play in the game, but how many followers do we each have now?
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   The numbers are unbelievable.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360]   Plus.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.360]   Yeah, they're growing fast.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.960]   Yeah, the numbers are they're so big that I almost don't.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   I'm skeptical.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.880]   Well, there's definitely spam.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   There's definitely spam.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.880]   I'm up to five hundred and ninety thousand.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   Holy cow.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.040]   I think I'm one.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.840]   They suggested the suggestion.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.800]   Yeah, I'm only two hundred seventy eight thousand.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800]   What?
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   That's literally those guys make no sense.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   Yeah, that makes no sense.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   Because you're the king.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.840]   No, no, no, I think I would follow.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.760]   I would rather follow Gina than follow me.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   I would.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.560]   The real thing is they put Gina right, Gina.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.360]   You're on the news list and then one of the tech list, which is exactly reversed.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.360]   Right.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.360]   That's why.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.880]   That just means you're twice as cool as me, Gina.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.800]   That is the only this is the only moment in time where I would be more popular than you
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.880]   on any social network.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:10.840]   I'm sure that's going to change this afternoon while you're in the air.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.440]   One last refresh real quickly.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   Nope.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.940]   No, no filing.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.640]   Our tool of the week, Gina Trapani.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.640]   Tip of the week.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.640]   Tip, I'm the tool.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   You're the tool.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   Tip on the tool.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   You're no one's tool there.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.160]   So I think getting the data you put into any app, having the ability to get it out should
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.400]   be feature zero.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.080]   But we all know that a lot of apps launch without the ability to get the data out that
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.080]   you put in.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.360]   This is why has data liberation from this is why you can't get your old tweets.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:46.480]   Well, Google music, if you haven't looked at it in a while, Google music just gave users
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.640]   the ability to download their songs, any songs that have been uploaded.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.080]   And that all happens kind of in the background and there's massive amounts of storage.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.560]   You can download your songs that you've updated uploaded from anywhere from the web or from
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.560]   the client.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.880]   It kind of makes it a little bit of like a Dropbox for your music.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.440]   The only restriction is the songs that you've purchased, you can only download like two
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.120]   times, two or three times.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.160]   But if you've just uploaded songs that you owned or ripped MPC that you ripped, you can
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.200]   download any number of times.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   And that's cool.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.200]   That's cool.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.200]   So it's not like a shiny new feature, but it's useful.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200]   Good use.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.680]   And maybe a good reason to upload your music to Google music.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.640]   Where do I, I'm looking at my Google music.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.600]   I don't see a download button.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.920]   Is it just like on Android or?
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.400]   If you click on a song, there's a down arrow that expands a menu and there's a download
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.200]   the song on the menu.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.200]   Got it.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   Yep.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   Yep.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200]   Very cool.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200]   Good.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.520]   Tyler, the creator, Yonkers.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.320]   And now our not my music.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:50.640]   And now our number of the week, do you have one for us, Jim?
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.600]   Well, thanks to Gina, Japan.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.600]   Hey, God bless you, Gina, who who got it from your pin board.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.280]   God bless you both.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.200]   There here's a number I'll do too.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.560]   What is this since the F8 conference in September?
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.360]   Over five billion songs have been shared.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.360]   Wow.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.960]   That's the new radio, right?
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.520]   That's the piracy folks is people passing around.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.560]   You create a frictionless way for people to share and you create the business model around
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.320]   that it can really happen.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   That's a bad thing.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.760]   Embedding stuff and betting content.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   That's really powerful.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.880]   And then my other number of the week is the French court find Google $660,000 because
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.120]   Google Maps is free.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.960]   Jesus.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.080]   So another map company didn't like that.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.760]   So that's that's watching out for the people.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.000]   And now last week I pissed off somebody in Germany.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.320]   This week I'll piss off somebody in France.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   Come on.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   That's a card.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   Come on.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   Global trolling.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.480]   I like death.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.160]   My tool I'll give you a couple.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.920]   One is how to make DuckDuckGo your default search.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   Why not?
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.420]   You got it.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:58.920]   You can make any search engine your fault search, but you need to know what the search
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.960]   string is.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:08.160]   You click the the spanner as they call it in Britain, the wrench and you go to preferences.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.320]   And in the basics you'll see right there there is search and unfortunately the faults
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.840]   are Google Yahoo or Bing.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.800]   But if you click manage a search engines you'll see that there are other search engines
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.040]   that they know about and if it's not in there which it's not.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.320]   It's funny they have pirate bay but not DuckDuckGo.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.400]   You can add DuckGo.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.600]   We can call it DG for the keyword.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:45.120]   And you just need a special string which would be DuckDuckGo/Q=EqualmationMark+%S.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:52.000]   That S will be substituted with the search string that you type in.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:01.040]   So once you do that now you can use DuckDuckGo for searching by typing in here DDG.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.920]   I don't think you can make it default unfortunately.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.360]   That would be nice but I think that that's maybe a little something that they don't let
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.660]   you do.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:18.440]   And then my tool is a little Facebook tool that I'm a sucker for this crap.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.240]   This is why I will, Facebook's got me.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.800]   The time you rejected them before and you came back and now you are there.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.440]   Now I'm there puppet.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.440]   Thank you.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.160]   The MovieMaker.com makes a movie.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.680]   Now you have to have a timeline and everybody's got one now in the next couple of weeks.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.360]   We'll all have a timeline.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:43.720]   And if you click, if you go there it will actually make a movie out of your timeline
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.320]   with music and everything.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.360]   You know I love these and if you've put some energy into the timeline, there's music
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.680]   on this too I think.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.160]   If you put some energy into your timeline you get, you don't hear in the onion?
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   That's exciting.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.560]   Yeah that was a mistake but you can change anything.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.680]   They look for apparently you saying the word Facebook because that's the only place I
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.640]   ever say it on video and they found it.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.880]   So you can change these defaults.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.080]   This is just the random.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.440]   This is my life.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.000]   Las Vegas Hilton, Caltrans worker.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.800]   But it's pretty dramatic.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800]   Is it recording?
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   Yes.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.520]   The way they've done this is actually pretty cool.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.480]   That is.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.920]   And I think this is a Facebook company, timelinemoviemaker.com.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.880]   And after they've made the movie you have your choice of different music and you can
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.480]   actually say don't use that picture, use this picture and stuff like that.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.040]   I think that's kind of neat.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.040]   It's compelling.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.640]   So if you can share it on your page and you can make your own movie and change settings
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.080]   and so forth.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.880]   Pretty clever I say.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   Sorry.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   Last check, Leo.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.040]   Is there anything?
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.120]   One more time to Edguss.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.480]   Search results we go into the breach.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   Dear friends.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   Nope.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.440]   Last thing they posted on Edgar is 2008.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.040]   So maybe it isn't today.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:22.360]   You did see a Loique Le Mer posting on path saying I asked Cheryl Sandberg at wef.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.920]   I congratulated her on the IPO and she just smiled.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.280]   But he says the smile was the kind of wide smile you'd make when you're going to be
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.000]   a billionaire in a bad scene.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.840]   How much is she probably already worth?
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.000]   Oh my god.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.560]   Well, she has some stock, right?
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560]   I presume.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560]   That's why.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.560]   I mean from Google.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.560]   Oh, from Google.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.080]   Hey, you know, you can always another billion.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.480]   It's always welcome.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.080]   Good for Cheryl.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.720]   She does good work.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.720]   I'm envisioning the Cheryl Sandberg scholarship, but that's just there.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.720]   There you go.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.720]   There you go.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.720]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.360]   You know, I actually really started to admire Bill Gates.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.240]   He did an interview I just read and he's really putting.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.360]   He says my kids will inherit nothing.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.560]   I'm going to take it all.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.040]   You know, there's a small trust for each of them and I'm going to take it all and put
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.880]   it back into the world for good.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.040]   And I just, that's amazing.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.040]   Look at it all around.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.320]   I mean, you know, he's a creature of Davos now and so all around, you know, people would
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.960]   just pop up and say, boy, I can't believe it, but I really admire Bill Gates.
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.240]   And he just, he'd be happy to get it again and again and again and for good reason.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.000]   He's doing amazing things.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.280]   It probably was an interview with Davos actually.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   And he's no longer the richest man because of it.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.400]   No, oh, by the way, our friend Bill Gross, who was on the show once before, has a neat
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:42.120]   new company, I forget the new, but ideal lab, that I saw at Davos where it's a $1,500
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.960]   solar electric powered house.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.000]   That's the, they built their first one.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.680]   It's really neat.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.680]   Wow.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.780]   So good on Bill.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.780]   We should get him back again.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780]   I love him.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:54.780]   Yeah, he's great.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.320]   Jarvis at the City University of New York.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   Read his book.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320]   Public parts.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.320]   It's a must.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.320]   He gots to, gots to, gots to read it.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   Gina Trappani.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.680]   I'll watch you with the lovely Kelly tomorrow.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.680]   Oh, that's right.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.680]   I forgot to mention.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.680]   Well, we'll, I'll mention it in a second.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.680]   Buzzmachine.com for his blog.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.520]   Gina Trappani is at smarter where.org for her blog and think up app.com and we'll
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   be back next week.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:19.880]   Somebody said that at the crunchies, I think have marks in a chatroom said that the crunchies,
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.720]   they said twig is this week in Gina.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.100]   I like it.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.100]   Thank you everybody.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.020]   Yeah, tomorrow, I'm, we did the show early.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:37.600]   We normally do this show every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC on
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.780]   Twit Live and you could download after the fact, but we did a little early today because
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:42.820]   I'm running out literally going to run out.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   We're late because of me.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:44.820]   It was my fault.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.420]   No, no, no, we're late because of me, but I'm going to run out the door, run to the
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:54.420]   airport, fly to New York and do live with Kelly and who DL Hugley.
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.420]   Oh, the comic.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.420]   That could be okay.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:02.400]   They have a place for each of us and I'm thinking they're not going to, but I have some really
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.700]   fun products, 20 really fun products to show, including the world's largest boom box.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:12.260]   I'm actually giving away the highlight of the show, but keep watching to the very end
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.260]   of the show.
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.140]   I hope we don't run out of time because I'm going to borrow Kelly's iPod and say, let's
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.740]   dance and put it in the world.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:27.420]   700 pounds, eight foot wide, four foot tall boom box from Beringer, $30,000 boom box.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.940]   We'll dance on our way out.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:36.780]   Charles Sandberg, according to our chat room, Flink says is worth $400 million.
