[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff and Gina are here. We're going to talk about Google I/O.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   What kinds of things we can expect, including a new Android TV,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   with those self-driving cars, and a whole lot more, including our Google Change Log.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the Sleepy Eye Edition.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Sleepy Eye in Germany, it's Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the city university of New York.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Actually, it looks like an M&M's gree.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   You look very serious in your black headphones.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I did just get out of the sauna, so my hair is fine.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, you're relaxed now, you're relaxed.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I tried to burn the cold out of my sinuses.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Is it freezing? Oh, you have a cold, I'm sorry.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Well, it's very kind of you to be with us.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You're in Germany for a Google event.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   A Google Big Tent event in full disclosure, as they flew me over.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   What is a Big Tent event?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's Google trying to make the ice with the world.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Policy, media, that kind of stuff, and they bring together panel discussions.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I've been to three or four of them, and they've all been around.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's mainly the international side.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   They've had a few in DC, but they'll have discussions about tomorrow.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's about media and Google.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The idea that it says on the Big Tent event page is to bring together many points of view
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   about the impact of the internet on society.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Right.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Big Tent event number 20 events in Europe.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Wow, look, they're all over.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Well, they've got a lot of them, yeah.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And you're speaking about what?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I'm doing 10 minutes on Germany and media and internet.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Oh, that should be fun.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Are you going to really, really rake them over the cold?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'll try to have a little subtlety to it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   By the way, that other voice is of course the great Gina Trapani of smarterware.org.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Think up.com and host.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   We're very proud to say host of all about Android on Tuesday nights on this show along with Jason.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yes, hello.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Hello.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Good to be here.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I'll try to be lively if Jeff is sleepy.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I thought we'd just do this show in a very low key.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I think we should all match his energy.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah, we should.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   All right.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Okay.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'll just relax.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Chill.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's like very chill.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, don't listen to this show while driving.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   There's a little bit going on.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You might be on it really too much.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   We're all members of the slow talkers of America.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   America.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   America.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It's a great bob and ray routine, which nobody but Jeff and I are old and is old.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Enough to even know who bob and ray are.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We just love them.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   You'll be talking about the go ahead.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I just appreciate making fun of slow talkers.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   That's why I was laughing.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I'm a close talker.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He's a slow talker between the two of us.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's a mess.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's horrible.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So Jake, did you get a chance to watch anything of Apple's event on Monday?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Because Google seemed to be the subtext there.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Apple.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I have to say that I didn't catch much of it at all and I read a few summaries afterwards.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It didn't sound like there was a whole lot there.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   How was Google a subtext?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   A couple of ways.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Apple for a while has been trying to get Google off of iOS.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Disintermediates Google and searches on iOS with Siri, for instance.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   If you search for something with Siri, even though search, the web search done with Google
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   is hidden from Google.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Only Google only sees Apple.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   They're bringing that to the desktop.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.760]   Spotlight searches now will search everything, not just your hard drive, but search the internet
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.000]   for information.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You will be able to see it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.760]   It will use Bing in some cases.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   It may use Google.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.800]   I guess Safari will continue to use Google.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.720]   But if you use the desktop, Spotlight search, it will use Bing.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.520]   Even then, it will not.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.840]   You won't be visible to Bing.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   Apple will.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.360]   But it will also use Wolf from Alpha and Wikipedia and all sorts of stuff.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:57.440]   It's very clear Apple has decided to market itself as the antithesis to Google, the privacy
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.640]   and security company.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.480]   They're offering, for instance, their plan to offer iCloud Drive, which will have roughly
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.040]   the same price as Google Drive.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.480]   It's going to be very inexpensive, 5Gigs free, and I think it's $1.99 a month for 100Gigs.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.840]   They're going to offer App Engine style services for developers, so you could put your app
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.240]   on the iCloud.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.480]   It will actually support a surprisingly large amount of data.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   I can remember what they said.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.800]   It was quite a bit of data for free.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.160]   It does very much feel like Apple saying, "All right, Google.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.080]   All right, Google.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   Take this.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   Take that."
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.560]   It certainly sounded like some of the iOS updates were very Android-y.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.920]   Well, they're doing a lot of the things Android has been doing all along.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.680]   It's already been doing for a long time.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.840]   And DuckDuckGo is now an option for private search in Safari, right?
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.280]   It's not even an option.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.480]   When you use private search in Safari, it defaults to DuckDuckGo.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.320]   Yeah, that's a big deal for DuckDuckGo.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.800]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.560]   It's kind of a pat in the back for them.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.880]   Apple also, yeah, they did a lot of things that Google has been doing on Android.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.440]   The fact that you could put in Swipe, for instance, they showed Swipe, third-party keyboards
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   on iOS.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   To me, it's a big deal because that was one of the main reasons I left iOS.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.080]   They're supposedly going to come out with a bigger screen iPhone this fall.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.880]   And if they do, that will be two of the big reasons.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.480]   I left iOS.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.800]   And they're offering some interesting reasons to go to iOS.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.680]   For instance, their Touch ID, their fingerprint sensor on the 5S is going to have more open
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   API.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.520]   You'll get third parties will be able to use it, which means banking apps last past things
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.640]   like that might be super-use it.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   That's really cool.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.080]   I think that's very cool, especially since it works so well.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.000]   We were hoping they would do that.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.400]   Yeah, that's big.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.800]   That's really big.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.000]   They are going to provide a form of inter-app communications.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.440]   Allah, Android, when you on Android install a new application, it's added to your share
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.120]   menu.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.360]   It will be doing that now on iOS.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.240]   That was also a huge drawback on iOS.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   Right.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.160]   You had Twitter, Facebook, email, and I was a AirDrop, and that was about it.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.360]   And you'll also, as a developer, you'll be able to write extensions that will then plug
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.480]   into services, like not just the share service.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   And by the way, as a developer, you'll have to explicitly plug into the share service.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.640]   Your extensions are a standalone binary that are part of the installation.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.400]   And I think Apple's really paying close attention to preserving security by making sure that
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.960]   the inter-app communications are very constrained, locked down.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   They encourage you in the documentation to make it look like the place you're going,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.680]   not the place you've come from, things like that.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.640]   I think they're actually doing it quite elegantly.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.880]   And somebody said, I'm curious what you think as a developer, Gina, and an Android user,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.120]   although also use an iPhone for a long time.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.040]   They said that it's easier, somebody said it's easier and probably more secure to go from
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.560]   a locked down state to a less locked down, as Apple has done, than to go in the other
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   direction as Google has done or Android has done to go from completely wide open to slowly
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.880]   tightening down the nuts, or Microsoft slightly tightening down the nuts.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   That seems to make sense.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880]   I would agree with that.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   I would agree with that.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.480]   It's sort of like you can lower prices, right?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.040]   But you can't really raise them.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.280]   That's a good analogy.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280]   It's a one way.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   It's very similar.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.120]   This is kind of copy and paste we're just seeing this happen over and over again, where
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.520]   these basic functions, on iOS, had to wait for a really long time.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.160]   But when they came, they were done very well.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.080]   It's almost like Android is the canary and the coal mine and Apple observes and then
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.320]   does their own take on it.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.120]   Their take on it is usually very beautiful and very functional.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.960]   They have the advantages learning from other implementations of what the issues are with
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   them.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.520]   Then they're moving into Google territory and things like home automation.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.280]   Google made a lot of noise about Google at home, but never really delivered the Cued
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   Guide.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   Yeah, the Cued.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.160]   Now, I should absolutely point out that everything that happened on Monday at WWDC was similar,
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.400]   was an announcement of something that is going to come to us.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.760]   Although we have seen a developer release of iOS 8 and people will tell me that there
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.560]   are a lot of nice features in this implementation.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.440]   It does seem to be fairly solid.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.400]   But it is a case of Apple saying, "Well, we're going to do home automation."
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.680]   That's something Google has said too.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.080]   Microsoft has been saying it for more than a decade.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.320]   Do you see anything at the Apple conference that makes you say?
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   No.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.280]   What they do at WWDC, they don't show it.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.760]   They didn't show any hardware at all.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.320]   It's not like Google I/O.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   Right.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:56.800]   They say, "You're going to get today iOS 8 pre-release," when I say you, I mean developers.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.320]   It's a developer show.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.200]   You're going to get OS 10, 10.10, which they've decided to name Yosemite.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   You're going to get that.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   You can download that.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.400]   You can start playing with it.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   Here's the specs.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.640]   Here's the API.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.880]   Here's some of the new features, not all.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.840]   We want you to start developing for it.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.600]   They don't say, "Oh, and here's our Apple at home device."
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   They do already have iBicans, and it looks like iBicans, which is the Bluetooth Low
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.600]   Energy.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.200]   I'm here.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   I'm here.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.280]   It's going to be used in a lot of interesting ways.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.440]   I think what Apple said, and again, they've got to implement it, was very compelling.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.240]   So much so that I have to say, I think probably come this fall.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.440]   They may have eliminated reasons for me not to use an iPhone.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.840]   I might look at going back to iOS for my main phone.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   Interesting.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   Interesting.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.320]   Well, see, they got to get a bigger screen.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.040]   I can't use that four-inch screen.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   That's crazy.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.520]   That's crazy talk.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.400]   But the keyboard was one of the reasons I was dying, too.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.560]   And the notification shade got better.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   More Android-y.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.000]   Although, it's hard to say, "What is Android's notification shade?"
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.760]   Of course, if you have a Nexus 5, you know what the pure version is.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:16.040]   But every manufacturer, Samsung, HTC, LG, everybody has their own variation on this.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   Right.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.200]   Well, I just met rich notifications that you can add controls, like reply, or tweet,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.440]   or skip to the next song, or pause, or whatever.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.720]   Those will be treated as I understand, as extensions.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.240]   So that's another kind of extension.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   Oh, I see.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.240]   Interesting.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   Interesting.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.440]   And by the way, that'll go to the desktop as well.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.960]   Oh, I know another thing they're going to add.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   Touchless voice.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:42.400]   So you'll be able to say, and I have to say, "I like this better than OK Google now."
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   Hey, Siri.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   Don't you like that?
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.880]   I said, "I'm abandoning all Android, all Google products."
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.880]   Because I can say, "Hey, Siri."
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   Hey, Siri.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   Hey, Siri.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   Hey, Siri.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.880]   Yeah, it's got a little bit of a go-go.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.520]   I'm going to go over until you can say, "Yo, Siri."
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   Yo, Siri.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   Yeah, Siri.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.760]   But you know what's funny is it reminds me that I almost always say, "Hey, Siri."
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:11.360]   It's like the episode of Vip on Sunday, or two Sundays ago, where he says, "Hey, Siri,
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.880]   how many horses died in World War I?"
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   He literally said, "Hey, Siri."
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.360]   And I feel like that's what everybody does anyway.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.040]   That Apple's software must just be discarding the first few words.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.480]   It's a subtle difference, but Siri is like, is it a persona?
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.360]   Or is Google sort of just the ever-present computer?
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.080]   So it's interesting that you say, "OK, Google versus hey, Siri."
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   Hey, Siri.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.800]   It's more like you're addressing a person.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.440]   And I'm telling you, if they get Scarlett Johansson's voice, it is over.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   It's over.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Oh, I loved her, by the way.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   What do you think?
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   Great movie.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.920]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   Really good movie.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Yeah, it was beautiful.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   It was compelling.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   It was very, really good.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.520]   And it raises you all very interesting issues.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   You will just buy an iPhone, you'll bury it.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.160]   Well, I think there is those who have.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.400]   Hell, if you can marry a pillow in Japan, you can marry an iPhone here.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.480]   Boy, that got dead silence.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   You can.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.480]   Hello, hello, Jason.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   Go ahead.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.920]   Jason Howl's new desk is right behind your head, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:24.680]   So if you see a very tall person just slowly, get your hand out of there.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.600]   Jason sinks slowly in the west.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.360]   We were a little concerned because at first we could see the top of his head over there.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   That partition.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.960]   That's prime real estate right there.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   He lowered his chair.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.920]   Oh, yeah, that's a good seat.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.920]   That's the good seat.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.320]   But he can't talk on the phone.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.920]   The world shows are on, right?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.120]   Can you talk on the phone while the shows are on Jason?
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.160]   He's not listening.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   He's muted now.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   He's muted.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   I don't know.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   He's a word.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.160]   It's a pretty directional mic.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.120]   I bet he could talk like this.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.600]   Yeah, Mike probably wouldn't pick it up.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.160]   We have this problem in general.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   We're going to be in the office.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.800]   That's the kind of go in the kitchen if they want to talk on the phone.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   That's okay.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.000]   We're a bunch of introverted nerds.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.360]   Nobody wants to talk on the phone anyway.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   All right.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.760]   I think it's enough.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.240]   But I just wanted to bring it up because it did feel very much like Apple was targeting
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.280]   Google in a lot of the things that they were bringing to the iPhone.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.560]   And doing, I think a lot of the right things to provide an alternative to Google and not
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.200]   copy Google, but to say if you want these features, but you want them where your privacy
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.920]   is going to be preserved, then we're going to provide an alternative.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.600]   But hold on a second.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.360]   So Apple's going to hide your identity from all these services, which means you don't
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.080]   get the customization opportunities you want.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   They want a, who's to say we trust Apple with all this information?
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   Right.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.200]   Well, I'm not saying one does, but if one does, then one would be happier with this.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.360]   And Apple has, anyone trusts Apple can create a cloud experience that actually works.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   That's a big, big, big.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   Right.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   I mean, I had a couple of big bloopers here.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.520]   You know, like, I mean, when you said App Engine on Apple, I was like, no way.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.880]   Well, but that may change if they can, you know, you're right.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.240]   They haven't delivered ever.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.960]   They, and they have some horrific failures with mobile me and so forth.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.720]   One hopes that they will do better, but it remains to be seen.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.600]   They did call Android a toxic health stew.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.400]   Oh, you missed that?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   I did.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.520]   I'm surprised you didn't talk about that last night on a list last night.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.680]   I'm sure actually they did talk.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.200]   I had to miss last night.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   Did they sit down stage?
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   That's amazing.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:48.120]   They quoted Adrian Kingsley Hughes, who is a ziti net writer and he says, Android fragmentation.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.200]   He's talking about the fragmentation has turned devices.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.520]   Here's the exact quote from a ziti net into a toxic health stew of vulnerabilities.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   Okay.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   I completely disagree, but, okay, but they did.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.800]   They put that in quotes on a big slide on the screen.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.960]   Wow, that's making Adrian very happy when they didn't mention their competitors.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.880]   I mean, the one place where Apple has a really long way to go and a lot of work to do is
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   a developer tools.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.440]   I mean, iTunes Connect, the app tools, the tools they give you as an app developer, mobile
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.520]   app developer in particular, because that's where my skills are compared to the Play Store
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   console.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   I mean, Google is far and away, much kinder to developers just in terms of stats and tools
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   and the ways to see how your app is doing and improve that.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.960]   I mean, Apple's always had extreme empathy for users, right?
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.640]   I think that Google's core competency is extreme empathy for developers, right?
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.240]   So like Google makes really great tools for nerds and Apple makes really great tools for
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.920]   humans, but if Apple wants developers to feel better about developing for their platform
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.080]   and using things like their version of App Engine, I think that they really have a lot
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   of work to do there.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.360]   By the way, last night's episode of All About Android was titled Swimming in a Toxic Health
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.360]   Stew.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   Yeah, clearly.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   Yes.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.080]   So I mean, you're a developer.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.640]   You've developed for both platforms.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.840]   It seems to me you have a good standing to talk about this.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.240]   So you think that it's more pleasurable to develop for Android?
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.840]   I mean, I was Android first and I was a Java programmer before Android.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.880]   So Android was very attractive to me.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.920]   Like I never really got my feet with Objective-C in the way that I would have liked or the
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.040]   way that I felt that I did with Android.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.720]   And I was developing for Android a lot earlier.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.880]   So I am certainly biased, but I do know the developer tools for Android are way better.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.320]   I do know that you have to test across a lot more devices and there are a lot more configurations
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.360]   to make sure that your app works on Android than iOS.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   So there's give and take there.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.080]   I mean, the fragmentation issue still is an issue.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.800]   But just talking about purely the tools for uploading your binary and distributing it
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.280]   to testers and seeing what countries your app is doing well in and how your localizations
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.200]   are doing and that kind of thing.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Google beats Apple's tools, hands down.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.240]   Actually, I think it would be fair to say that Java is a toxic health stool.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.240]   Stool.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.000]   Java Script is a toxic health stool, but that's another one.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.680]   But Java and JavaScript really are somewhat of a health stew.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   And in fact, Apple--
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.160]   I'll just use them not much better.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.200]   Well, Apple responded to that and I guess you missed it.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.880]   But Apple has introduced a replacement for Objective-C.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.600]   They're calling it Swift.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.840]   They're saying it's significantly faster than Objective-C.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.920]   So that's good news.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.200]   And it avoids basically what they-- I think I could safely synopsize this and say what
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.680]   they've done is eliminated downward compatibility, eliminated all the things from C that they
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.320]   put in Objective-C just so it would be C-friendly.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   And--
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.880]   Is this mean you have to rewrite apps now?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880]   You do not.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.240]   Objective-C is not deprecated or replaced.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   In fact, you can write apps in both languages at once.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   But the idea is it is an expressive tool for writing code for a cocoa and cocoa touch
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.600]   that is desktop in iOS.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.680]   I think it's a beautiful language, a very nice language.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.440]   And they've provided something very interesting called Playgrounds, which reminds me a lot
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.240]   of say the Python interpreter where you can go in the interpreter and try statements,
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.960]   try code and see what happens.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.240]   The Playground gives you a graphical interface that lets you try code.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.480]   It's really a debugger because you can use a scrubber to go back and forth in your code,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:54.640]   see how it impacts the graphical output, modify it, get instant changes, very interesting programming
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640]   language.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.440]   I think developers are going to like a lot.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   It's not going to be hard to learn.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.360]   It's C-like.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:06.760]   But they've eliminated some of the things that made C dangerous and Objective-C dangerous.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.000]   They've eliminated some of the things that you don't need anymore.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.560]   And they've eliminated some of the constructs that were unsafe.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.200]   It uses not strong typing.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.360]   It's typed by inference.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.240]   But it is fairly immutable typing.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.560]   So variables must be initialized before use.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.520]   They have built in array and integer overflow checking.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.000]   Instead of garbage collection, which is what Java does, they use reference counting.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.600]   Yeah, they call ARC.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.040]   I think that this might be an interesting one.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.200]   I'd love to get your take on it at some point.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.920]   I know it's probably not high on your list.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.360]   But it reminds me of Python or Ruby, which I love, these scripted languages, but has
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.920]   the efficiency of Objective-C because it compiles down to the LLVM.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.280]   I mean, the benchmarks they showed were kind of, as usual, carefully chosen.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.520]   Yes, of course.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   I am excited about that.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.880]   Particularly around the tools.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.920]   I think that over the last few years of all these learning how to code tools, we've seen
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:16.080]   a lot of interactive editors and then see as you type, see how your code affects things.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.400]   And I'd love to see those built into modern IDE's, even something as advanced as Xcode.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.040]   I mean, anything that helps developers be more productive and not have to think about
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.480]   things like memory management and garbage collection, those were a good thing.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   It means better apps.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   It means faster deploys.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.000]   Yeah, I'm excited about Swift.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.440]   I'm definitely going to play around with it.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.160]   Because like I said, I never quite got into Objective-C.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.000]   I always found that sort of frustrating and foreign.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.440]   So yeah, I would definitely check out Swift.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.200]   I'd even rewrite my app in Swift just for the fun of it.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   Yeah, I think it looks pretty fun.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   I downloaded it and started playing with it immediately because I like to, frankly, I
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.960]   think this is what's interesting about this is this is going to encourage, by the way,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   this is free.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.840]   Everybody who uses it in Mac and uses it is not cross-platform.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   Objective-C was cross-platform.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840]   It's not cross-platform.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.560]   This is Apple only.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.120]   But they offer free documentation.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.840]   $99 become an Apple developer and then you get access to a ton of stuff.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.240]   Well, stay on that for a second.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.360]   It's never been easy to write apps for both platforms.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.280]   Does this make it yet harder?
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   Yes.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.280]   Absolutely.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   That's right.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.600]   If you start writing in Swift, you're not writing cross-platform.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.200]   You're writing to the hardware.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   Right.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.440]   But if you're writing in Objective-C, you're also writing for the platform too.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.120]   Objective-C, you could write on other platforms, but no one ever, it's kind of like Java now.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.840]   People are building Android apps in Java, right?
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.120]   Theoretically, sure, there are other things you can write Java for.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   When you wrote...
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.400]   Particularly the Android SDK or the whole set of Android-specific classes, that's Android
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   only.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.040]   There are some frameworks that help you build an app and then deploy native code on both
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   platforms.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.200]   I don't know how good they are, but there are people out there trying to solve that problem,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.920]   but Apple's not going to solve that problem.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.040]   You have to do it at a very high level.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.600]   There's Unity and there's other things that let you do that.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.160]   It's always been the case.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   I'm sure with to-do.txt, you didn't have share any or much code.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   No, no.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.000]   I mean, the design pattern, sure.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.160]   Like the objects and things, but no, there's no shared code.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.080]   This line itself, by the way, very well to design patterns.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.720]   A lot of the things they've done are fairly modern.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.360]   But as people in the chatroom are saying, Go is just as modern.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:33.960]   I've fixed many of these problems.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.800]   Apple has no interest in being cross-platform.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   It's not in their interest.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.880]   Microsoft is interesting.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.920]   Microsoft is a little more open to that notion.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.880]   Apple's saying, this is for writing for our stuff.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.680]   I think it was Farhad Manju who was asking why are companies building new programming
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.840]   languages right now?
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:08.520]   It happens not as often as platforms or apps, but it is interesting to see Go and Swift and
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.080]   new languages emerge.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.520]   At some point, you say, haven't we figured out every way to express a certain thing?
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.480]   I just think requirements change and different kinds of hardware change and the problems
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.840]   become a little more common.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.880]   I think certain languages handle it a little better.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:33.160]   I think also the fads and trends in programming, things like design patterns often lend themselves
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   better to new languages and old languages.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.320]   People write the languages around the trends in programming.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.840]   I think Go is a good example.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.400]   I'm sure Swift is as well.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.800]   You will like it that, I don't know if you remember this, but Apple bought a company
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.000]   called TestFlight a few months ago.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.880]   Developers are very disappointed because they used TestFlight to beta.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.200]   Test apps for iOS, Apple Bottom.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.600]   The good news is, they have immediately made it available even under the same name TestFlight.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.920]   Now you can have 1,000 beta testers instead of 100 on your iOS app.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   The process is easier.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.760]   It's much easier to get feedback and so forth.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   That's also--
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   TestFlight was a godsend.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.400]   I used TestFlight to do text.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.760]   I literally could not figure out how to have people beta test my--.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   With Android, you email the APK.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.760]   So here's the file.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   Install it.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   Here's the file.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   Install it.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   Like, OK, maybe you have to uncheck Allow Unknown Sources and Android, right?
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.760]   But with an iOS app, it's a whole rigamarole.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   You have to get the device ID and allocate license.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.120]   I didn't even understand.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.840]   I went through the steps.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.920]   I went through the 26 steps that it took to do it in the end.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.160]   I didn't really know what I did.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.960]   I just prayed and it worked.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   But TestFlight made that a lot easier.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   Still, TestFlight was a pain.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.560]   You had to ask people to join TestFlight and add their device and then you could issue
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.560]   them.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.480]   Anyway, this is kind of what I was talking about.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.160]   This is just about the issue of having your app distributed only through the app store
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.560]   and approval and all that stuff.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.160]   So the TestFlight acquisition was certainly a step in the right direction.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.720]   TestFlight is great.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.320]   But it's solving a problem that just doesn't exist in a Play Store.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.240]   Yeah, it's a problem Apple created, really.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   Right.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.920]   It's a problem that they created, exactly.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.800]   The jailbreak and iPhone requires all sorts of maneuvers and hoops you have to jump through
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.640]   and you can't do it with current versions of iOS, etc.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.400]   To jailbreak Android phone, you just go into settings and you check the box.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.040]   It says a loud third party app.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   That's it.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   You're done.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   Right.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   Decide load.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.760]   That's all jailbreaking does in iOS and that's which has kind of said something that people
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.480]   make such a big deal to do that.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.000]   So yeah, I think I said this on Monday.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.040]   There is still a very big gulf between proprietary and open and there are advantages to being
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.480]   proprietary.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.880]   As you know, in Germany, the trains ran on time under Mussolini.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.240]   That was Italy.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.920]   But sometimes fascism benefits.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   But I think generally I come down on the side of openness.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   A little more chaos.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.840]   It's chaotic.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.080]   It's a toxic health stew and we like it.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.440]   Now we got a title.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   We might have to steal it.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   We like it.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   All right.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.840]   Come back with more Jeff Jarvis poor guy.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.480]   He just got out of the sauna.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.400]   His brain is bubbling still.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.240]   A Venus Schnitzel and a sauna.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.520]   That's a recipe for disaster.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520]   Talked out.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.720]   It's barely moving.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.640]   She didn't repent.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.080]   Are you give a cold or you'll go under the weather too?
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.400]   Oh my god.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.480]   It's the walking wound here.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.560]   Well, I'm feeling pretty good.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   And I had.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.760]   I had nothing to say about Apple development.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.320]   So I guess you're probably right.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.800]   Finally, I'm tired.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   You know about Apple stuff.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Gina gets a word in it.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   Why is finally on the show?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   It's good.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   It's good.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.480]   And by the way, Ben tells me in Germany, the trains never run on time.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.560]   They don't know that Germans complain mightily about their friends.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.360]   Well, they don't now.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.600]   That's the point.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   And it was it.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   I'll move on.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.880]   I don't want to go too down this road.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.480]   We're going to take a break and come back in a moment with more.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.360]   We're talking about, in fact, we'll get our to Google change log in here.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.160]   Let Jeff take a little bit longer nap.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.800]   Our show brought to you today by our friends at LegalZoom.com.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.720]   And not a law firm.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:34.400]   It provides self help services so that you can get legal work done without paying a high
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.640]   price for a fancy lawyer.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:44.520]   LegalZoom.com turns out a lot of the legal stuff you do, including forming a business,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.360]   can be done easily without a lawyer.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.680]   America was built by innovators and dreamers.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.840]   Man, we are in an age of innovation.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.160]   And that's really exciting.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.120]   It's what makes this country work.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.760]   And actually, let's say the whole world work.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.480]   We're an exciting time.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.880]   LegalZoom is celebrating this month.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.720]   I think it's like national start your own business month or something like that with
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.600]   a deal to help you start your own business, to launch your dream.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.760]   Whether it's applying for a patent to secure your invention, registering your trademark
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.360]   to protect your products, your services, your brand, or incorporation or forming an LLC
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.800]   to launch your business, LegalZoom can do it for you at an amazing price.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:36.240]   Look at that, 99 bucks to start an LLC or a chapter S or C corporation.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   That's what we did.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   99 bucks.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:45.680]   We're still using those LLC papers, the operating agreement, where I created in 2005.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.480]   Over a million businesses have gotten off on the, started off on the right foot with
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.760]   LegalZoom has received an A plus from the Better Business Bureau.

[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.720]   C?
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   Should I be an LLC?
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   Could I be a nonprofit?"
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.760]   Those are the kinds of things that an attorney is very useful for.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.320]   Then you fill out the forms on LegalZoom.com.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   I love it.

[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.560]   Check out LegalZoom for their support, not only of this week in Google, but really make
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.040]   it to it happen.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.400]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.600]   Time, ladies and gentlemen, for the Google Change Log.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.160]   The Google Change Log.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.080]   This is where we, as in Gina Tarpani, give you all the things that have changed at Google
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.440]   this week.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.840]   You can tell us the month of Google I/O because there's a lot going on.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   Let's see if I can punch through this.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.760]   I guess the big announcement this month is that Google announced that they're working
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.960]   on a new Chrome extension called End to End.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.800]   Which kind of sounds sturdy, but it's not.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   It's streamlined.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.040]   It sounds like the last episode of Silicon Valley, if we're going to be perfectly honest.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.440]   That was middle to middle.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   Middle to middle.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   Okay.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.280]   Different kind of encryption.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.440]   Different kind of encryption.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.600]   Chroma extension streamlines the process of using PGP to encrypt your email when you're
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   using Gmail.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.160]   This extension actually hasn't been released yet.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.280]   Google just released the code for review by the community.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.880]   They want to make sure that it's as secure as it absolutely should be.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.080]   It's up on code.google.com.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.080]   You can check it out.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   It's a Chrome extension.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   It's very early.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.280]   It's not in the extension store because it's really, they want to have people look at it
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   and bang on it.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   Right.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.640]   This is something that we've talked about on the show a bunch of times.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.200]   What are the implications of, if your email, if your content is encrypted in your browser
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.080]   and sent via Gmail to someone else, they decrypt it on their client, Gmail doesn't
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   see the content.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.440]   They can't advertise to you against a bunch of jumbled letters.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.160]   This is Google the best.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.040]   I feel like this is Google really not being evil.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   I'm excited.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.640]   I hope that this extension works well.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.720]   I hope it supports other webmail providers than just Gmail.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.720]   They say it will.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.560]   Yeah, yeah, that's an ambitious goal.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.000]   It's JavaScript, which is great.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.080]   It uses a JavaScript OpenPGP library.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.320]   So it's open.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.760]   It's open source.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:01.520]   You can look at the source because it's JavaScript and it will work anywhere because it's built
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.080]   in encryption.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   This is exciting.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.640]   I think this is really the best.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.600]   I'm thrilled that Google's are doing this.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.160]   I think their attitude is, well, most people won't do it all the time, so it's not a big
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   deal.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   Right.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   Right, right, right.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   It's going to be on by default.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.800]   I think that you're going to have to say I'm sending an email I care about and encrypt
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   this.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   And hopefully it'll be a button.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   It'll be that easy.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   What else we got?
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Okay, Chromecast.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.280]   A few new Chromecast enabled apps.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.840]   The Watch ESPN app, my sports fan of my house, is very excited about this.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.440]   Watch ESPN app is now Chromecast enabled.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.440]   You can also watch me.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.120]   Just in time for the World Cup.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.120]   Yes.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.240]   Major League Soccer via the MLS Match Day app and MLS Live.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.080]   Those are premium services.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.400]   The Crunchy Roll Video Service, which has a bunch of TV and video content, also now Chromecast
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.680]   enabled.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.280]   And you can also stream your photos and videos in the Google+ app to the Chromecast.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.640]   So you can enable that feature.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:03.000]   You tap the Cast button in the Photos view of the Google+ app on iOS or Android.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.840]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   That's a good one.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.480]   I wanted to see pictures of my kid that my wife took all day while I was at the end of
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   the day.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.480]   My browser was close over time.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.760]   I said, "Hey, let me show you this.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   That's great."
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   I love that.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.760]   Yeah, really nice.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.400]   What else we got?
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.240]   Oh, Google launches a 64-bit version of Chrome starting with the Dev and Canary channels.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.080]   And this is for Windows 7 and Windows 8.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.000]   So in both cases, the 64-bit version is offered by default.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.440]   If you're running the 64-bit flavor of Windows, the 32-bit version, of course, is still available.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.440]   And the reason why they're building the 64-bit version is it's just better.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.840]   Better speed, better security, better stability for 64-bit Windows users.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.400]   Google+ the Google+ app for iOS is playing a little catch up with Android.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.800]   It just got updated with the Stories, which came out for Android a couple of weeks ago
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.960]   in photo filters.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.920]   So you can download that now on devices running iOS 6.0 or later.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.160]   That's the really cool feature that takes your photos and figures out where you were
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.240]   and makes this story that you can page through and see where you went.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.280]   And I think Leo, you've demoed a story that you made from one of your trips and your pictures.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   Really cool feature.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.880]   So iOS users get that now.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   Yeah, automatically.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.600]   It's just awesome.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.200]   Let's see.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   Google's adding a one-click Hangout button that you can add anywhere on any web page, any app.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.760]   It's basically a start button for starting Hangouts and they're targeting, it seems like
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.840]   companies, enterprise customers who want to offer customer service Hangouts or job interviews
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.600]   or instant meetings and their apps.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.160]   It's already been available to select Google Enterprise customers that they've used it
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.240]   in a bunch of ways, including embedding it into online collaboration files, customer
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.640]   support apps and sales apps and interacting with job candidates.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.160]   So now it's become available to everyone.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.320]   So the buttons, super customizable.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.760]   You can render it in markup, HTML5, JavaScript, it's available in many languages.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.360]   So you can basically just kick off a Hangout from anywhere.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.080]   Finally, earlier this week, and I'm sure my co-host talked about this last line on
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:13.200]   Alabama and Android, Google posted factory images for the latest build of Android 4.4.3
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.400]   and the update is start to roll out to Google experience Android devices.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.080]   One of the updates, I think this is a pretty light update, but one of the updates includes
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.560]   a fresh design of the dialer app.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.640]   So you got a new color scheme, blue, black, gray and white, and the action bar turn went
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.680]   from gray to blue.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.720]   And I think that this is the kind of design refresh we're going to see across a bunch
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.600]   of Google apps at I/O later on this month.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   So I think we're going to see more of this.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.920]   And that's all I got.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.800]   And that's Google Exchange Log.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.480]   I'm excited about the encryption.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.440]   I think it's going to be a big deal, because you can do it now, but you have to install,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.840]   plug in, and it's just not easy.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.200]   It's not for the everyday person.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.280]   And it puts pressure on other Webmail providers, and actually didn't include this in this bit
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   of the story.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.480]   But as part of this announcement about the end-to-end, Google published this transparency report
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.920]   about which Webmail providers support which kinds of encryption.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:17.360]   And it's kind of like public shaming as a way to get more providers to support TLS and
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.440]   all the kinds of encryption.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.120]   So show the screen if you can.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.400]   Chad, I don't know if you have my screen.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   There it is.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.120]   Webmail was encrypted in transit.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:32.280]   Coming from Google, 69% of messages from Gmail to other providers were encrypted.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   That's great.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.440]   That's in the last 30 days.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   The last year, you can see it started sometime between October and January of 2013, 2014.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.520]   But that's a good number.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.600]   But then if you look at messages coming from other providers, less than half is encrypted
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   on its way to Google.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:54.400]   And the reason that's important is you might say, "Well, I have an encrypted connection
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.080]   to Google and nobody can read my email as I compose it and upload it to Google."
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.600]   But the minute it goes off of Google's servers, it's transported across the public internet.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.080]   And in many cases, it's not encrypted.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.960]   You have to both sides have to agree to encryption.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.440]   Google obviously does offer that in its SMTP client.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   I guess what do they use?
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   Are they using SMTP?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   I don't even know what they use.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.280]   But many, many providers don't.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.720]   It is public shaming.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.720]   It's saying, in fact, they even have a little ad.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.680]   Let's make email safer.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:39.840]   And if you go to, have you gone to this URL, g.co/saferemail or you can see how safe yours is.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.240]   And they have a list of email encrypted and so forth.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   This is a good...
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.120]   It is the right answer.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.880]   It's not encrypted because it wasn't originally intended to be encrypted.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.840]   Nobody thought email should be encrypted.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.440]   It's only now that we want to do it.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.440]   Thanks to my Edward Snowden.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.160]   I'm just going to type in that.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.400]   Can you guys hear me?
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400]   We hear you now.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.760]   My other headset, my headset, correct contact.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   Oh.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.560]   I thought you bought a new one just for this show.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   That was actually my...
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   I did.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   I had you...
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   Was your poll?
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.720]   Yeah, during the ad, I muted you because of the headset Russell.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.320]   Right now we're not getting your video.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.000]   He turned out the lie.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Sorry.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.600]   I feel like Jeff jumps like leaps tall buildings in order to do the show.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.080]   I know he really does.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   He does.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   I'm going to hang up and come back.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.080]   Okay.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.680]   We'll get you back in a minute, Jeff.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.320]   Google has a very good page.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:44.200]   If you go to this Google transparency report again, g.co/saferemail and you go to the bottom,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:52.280]   there's a really good page on how encryption works that explains why this is an issue,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:59.960]   why you should encourage this kind of encryption from your email provider and so forth.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   It's using TLS.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   TLS.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:08.840]   It means you've got to use TLS from your server to their server and you have to support TLS.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   TLS is SSL.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.320]   It's the same thing.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.640]   We used to encrypt our transactions to our bank in Amazon and so forth.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   Right.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   It's the difference between sending.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.880]   I think this is the analogy they use.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.360]   Sending a postcard versus sending a letter at an envelope.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.080]   It's not foolproof.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.240]   Someone could certainly rip open the envelope, right?
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.680]   But it's the difference between sending it in the clear.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.040]   They have two beautiful illustrations, one with a postcard and all the bad guys who are
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.720]   snooping on your postcard and then with an encrypted pipe and those bad guys just can't
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   see into it.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   That's what we do.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.520]   One other advantage of this kind of encryption is that the argument before was that if you,
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.400]   only the people who used encryption were doing suspicious things, the more people use encryption,
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.880]   the less those who use encryption will look suspicious.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   Exactly.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880]   Exactly.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:04.520]   It's why I started using PGP and then later opened PGP because I wanted to establish
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.400]   a base line of encryption.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.640]   Everybody should be encrypting all the time.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.480]   It's not a tacit admission of guilt.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:23.000]   It was a funny post on Google+, this week, right after WWDC.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.280]   He said, "Google announces it's going to spend a billion dollars to buy low-altitude satellites
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.440]   to provide internet to the entire world and gets no attention.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.960]   Apple announces a font change and everybody's going, "Ooh, ah!"
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.880]   And I think this might be the underreported story of the year to this point.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.080]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.520]   And even I have buried the lead.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:54.080]   Google has said they're going to spend, they are spending more than a billion dollars to
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:43:00.480]   put up their own satellites, a fleet of satellites, low-orbit satellites that will bring the
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:06.520]   internet to unwired regions of the globe, especially to underdeveloped nations, people
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:11.320]   who have financial and technical reasons, they can't get the internet.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:18.460]   This is being led by Greg Weiler, who's the founder of Orb Networks, a satellite communications
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.040]   startup.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.760]   And they've been hiring engineers to work on the project.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   They've allocated a billion dollars, maybe as much as three billion dollars to do it.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.080]   Was this satellites or balloons or groans?
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.880]   This is not balloons, this is not drones, this is satellites, something a little more,
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.280]   say down to earth, a little more stable, that's right.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.720]   So it was something better understood.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.560]   More latency.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.720]   Yeah, but I think that the feeling is if you've got no internet, a little latency is better.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.280]   Take what you can get.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:06.280]   You may remember that Craig McCaw, who created cell phones basically, was cellular one, who
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.200]   really put it on the map.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:14.160]   And Bill Gates founded a company called Teladizik more than 20 years ago to do the same thing
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.840]   to put Leo's low-Earth orbit satellites for internet service.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.960]   That thing was a nine billion dollar project that basically flopped.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.320]   They stopped doing it in 2002.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   They also may remember Iridium, which was a satellite phone service using lower-Earth
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.960]   orbit satellites that went into bankruptcy in 1999.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.720]   So this is something that's been tried before, but it seems to me that Google has the best
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.520]   shot at it.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.120]   These are 1500-pound satellites.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.840]   And they, I'm sorry, I take it back.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.320]   These are 250-pound satellites.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:55.000]   They're a lot smaller than the traditional 1500-pound satellites.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.320]   And they want to circle the globe with them, which is quite amazing.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:08.600]   160 satellites, it really could actually solve this problem in such an interesting way.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   You've got to get regulatory.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.680]   That's a faithful product of the same thing, you know, and there are problems.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.160]   But it just, the business case for Google just makes more sense to me.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   Right.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:23.760]   They also say that they think that they can make ground antenna systems much more inexpensive.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.320]   And traditionally, they cost lots of money to get the receive.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.120]   We're talking hundreds of dollars instead of millions.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   I think this is really-
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120]   Here's my other question.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.840]   Can governments interfere with this?
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   Yes, they have to.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   I mean, that's the problem.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:42.960]   You're going to float a satellite or two or three over every nation in the world.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.560]   You're going to have some issues.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:53.240]   So there is absolutely, there's regulatory issues and so forth.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   But there would be with balloons.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   They would be with drones.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   Right, with what they were, it wouldn't matter.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.400]   Definitely depictions.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.600]   I think these are geostationary, but I'm not sure.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.240]   No, they're just low-worth orbit.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.040]   Why are there regulatory-
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   They should understand.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:13.640]   The satellite goes straight to your phone, the satellite goes to a ground receiving station
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   to your phone.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.120]   Ah, I'm sure it's not straight to your phone, but I don't know.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.600]   Okay, that's why you have government.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   Right.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   Right.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.040]   I'm sure what they're eliminating is the line to the pop.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   Right.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   Right.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   Right.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:37.120]   Google has Sherlock Loon, says USC Waller and our chatroom.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:44.600]   And only a bunch of geeks would even understand what that sentence means.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.600]   Very interesting.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   I mean, really interesting.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.200]   But I mean, there's a long way to go still.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.800]   But clearly Google has placed a bet here.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.560]   If hired between 10 and 20 people, and they're reporting to Craig Barrett, who reports to
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.560]   Larry Page.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.400]   It seems like money well spent and money more sensibly spent than a lot of their Google
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   X stuff, right?
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.320]   I mean, it makes complete total sense, right?
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   It's good for Google.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   It's good for the world.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   It's good for the world, right?
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.280]   It makes them look, I mean, it's a win-win all the way.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.680]   When we come back, I want to talk a little bit about what we're going to expect from
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   Google I/O.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.880]   What we've seen, Apple, we've got the E3 gaming conference next week.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.480]   Amazon has just announced it's going to do something in the third week of June.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.400]   This is a crazy month, but Google wraps it up with Google I/O.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.040]   You're both coming out for it.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.440]   We'll be covering it, of course, the keynotes.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.720]   What are we going to see?
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.920]   In some ways, how does Google respond to Apple?
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   Can they top Apple?
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.440]   It's always risky being the first.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.840]   Before we do, though, I want to show you something Google did that's so cool.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.800]   You really should be able to take advantage of it.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.520]   I think we started when they did Chromebooks.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.440]   They said, "You know, we've got to get a way to print from a device that is not hooked
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.160]   up to a printer that is traveling all around.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.280]   Maybe our Android device is the same thing."
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.200]   They created Google Cloud Print, which is a very nice solution, easy to set up, easy
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.040]   to use.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.800]   If your printer supports it, it's a stat.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   What if your printer doesn't?
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   Are you going to buy a new printer just to print from your Android device?
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:27.080]   I can print from here to my printer at home over the Internet using Cloud Print.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.480]   This is the first and only print server officially certified by Google for Cloud Printing.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.720]   It says right there, "The Made for Cloud Print."
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   That's the...
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.320]   I got to get one of those because I got the call.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.760]   I think I told you guys, I gave my wife the Chromebook, the Pixel.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   She loved it.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.480]   And she used it without any questions or any complaints for many months.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   But just a couple weeks ago, I got the call.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   She said, "I need to print."
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.480]   How do I print?
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.480]   How do I print?
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   I said, "Oh, can you just plug the printer?"
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   She's like, "No."
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   Do you have a Cloud Print?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   I was like, "No."
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.600]   Well, almost any printer will work with this.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.080]   More than 4,000 top brand printers.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   It's nice about it.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   There's no software to install.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.520]   There's nothing to do.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   You literally...
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   This is it.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   It's a small little device.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.720]   It's the size of a power brick for a laptop.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.440]   On one side, there's ethernet, power, USB.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.560]   That's about it.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:26.200]   What you'll do when you open it up, you plug it in and it automatically sees all the printers
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.520]   on the network.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.360]   If you have printers that need to be connected via USB, you can do that directly, of course.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.960]   It supports multiple printers, virtually unlimited Android devices, allows USB printers to be
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.760]   shared all over the network.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.440]   It means any printer, almost any printer.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:48.360]   I may not work with your Epson MX100.matrix printer, but almost any other printer into
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.600]   a Cloud Print compatible printer.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.880]   Such a good idea.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   We've seen...
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.240]   They've made one for AirPrint too that we advertised for a long time.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.240]   We got lots of emails from people saying, "I can't believe how easy this was to set up.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.640]   People in schools and so forth use it."
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.760]   It makes it very easy to make your network Cloud Print compatible.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   I want you to try it.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.200]   It's $149.95.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.040]   For that, you get up to 10 network printers and eight USB printers simultaneously.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.960]   It's more than just a household device.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.520]   Every office, every business should have this.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.920]   Every school.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.000]   Visit xprincervor.com/twit to find out more.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.680]   I didn't mention the name, did I?
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.120]   It's from a company called Landtronics.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.600]   It's the XPrint server, Cloud Print Edition.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.280]   $150.xprincervor.com/twit.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.040]   If you do use the offer code to it, you'll get free shipping.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.600]   You'll get it quickly.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.760]   It's a little weird because it requires so little configuration.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.960]   One of those things where people go, "That's it?
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   Yeah, that's it."
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.680]   They should actually add some steps just to make people feel better.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   That's it?
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.680]   It's working?
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   There is no step three.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   There is no step three.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   It's awesome.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   XPrint server.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.960]   It's not a bit too much to advertise this, Leo.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   I ordered while you were still doing the commercial.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   Oh, have you set it up yet?
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.960]   No.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.960]   All right.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.720]   You've got to do that when you get home and do a little demo for us on the show.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.880]   And print from the pen.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   I think I mentioned that I have a Macintosh now that is nothing but a Google Cloud Print
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   server.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.240]   Oh, because it's sharing the printer and then you go to-- yeah, that's a pain.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.400]   Yeah, so now I can get rid of that.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.960]   You don't have to keep that Mac on all day.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   Right?
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   I love it.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.960]   Really great idea.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   XPrint server.com/twit.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:43.000]   Google, according to Gigahome, will be announcing its Android TV, the successor to Google TV.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.240]   I loved Google TV.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.720]   Apparently, it was kind of a flop.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.640]   Of course, we know the queue was a flop.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:52.120]   I announced two years at a Google I/O.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:57.400]   Google is about to open another front in the War for Your Living Room, right, Janko Rickers.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.080]   When he's set to announce the launch of Android TV at I/O in June, according to sources, multiple
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.480]   sources familiar with Google's plans.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.680]   But what is Android TV?
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.280]   Well, it's not a device.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.120]   It is a platform that others can build a device to.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.160]   Actually, that happened with Google TV too.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.480]   Didn't LG and others say we're going to use Google TV on our TV?
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.480]   I'm not sure what this is new.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   According to this article--
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.200]   Because everybody has smart TV platforms with their own?
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.560]   That's a bad thing, because it means as a developer of apps, you have to develop one for LG, one
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.000]   for Amazon, one for 8.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.520]   It means crazy for high sense.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.400]   One system would be very nice.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:44.240]   The company is calling this technology that they're using, Pano, P-A-N-O.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.240]   It's kind of like zero config for apps.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.760]   Apps can surface individual pieces of content right on the home screen in a card-like fashion.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:59.440]   So users can browse movies, TV shows, and other types of media as soon as they turn on Android
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.120]   TV.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   Content is in a card.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.560]   This is Google loves cards, right?
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   Google now.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.560]   Yeah, it's Google all about the cards.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   They can be browse horizontally.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:12.040]   Each movie or TV episode has deep links into the publisher's apps, giving users the option
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.320]   to start playback right away.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:20.000]   So there'll be a gather from this, an overall interface that knows about the apps but focuses
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.320]   on the content.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.960]   That's what you want, isn't it?
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.480]   You don't want to have to go, "Well, let me see.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.520]   Is it Hulu Plus or HBO Go?
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.520]   Let's go to HBO Go.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   It's not in there.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.520]   What you want is you want to see all the shows."
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.000]   And then you say, "I want to watch that show."
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.320]   And then you say, "Okay, well, there's three ways to watch it."
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   Doesn't that seem sensible?
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.800]   That's got to be the key, right?
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.600]   So it sounds like this is just new interface and it sounds like there's an emphasis on
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:49.440]   gaming, which makes a lot of sense because Google's really been pushing hard on giving
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:55.800]   developers more tools for building games and gaming is something that Chromecast can't
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   do.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.680]   I mean, I can't really get my head around why you'd have the Chromecast, which is so
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.520]   great and so successful and this.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:09.720]   I mean, it seems like that's more power and a better interface is what this Android TV
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.400]   would get you.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.440]   So according to JENCO, there are two answers to that question.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.000]   One is strategic and one is political.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.920]   "Google I/O," he says, "You're likely going to hear the strategic one, which goes a bit
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   like this.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.760]   Chromecast is a great inexpensive device for consumers that want to use their mobile devices
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.400]   to launch content, right?
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.800]   But due to its aggressively priced limited hardware, it can't do everything you'd like
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.880]   to do in particular.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.040]   You nailed it.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.040]   Gaming.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:45.720]   So it would make sense to have a second device that's more powerful that isn't $35, maybe
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.440]   $100 it can play games like the Amazon Fire TV, right?
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.960]   Or as JENCO says, "And Uya done right."
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.880]   So that's the strategic reason.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:04.200]   The political reason, according to JENCO, is really about corporate politics.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:09.640]   Google TV launched in 2010 as a new product based on Android, but beyond that, didn't
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.400]   share a whole lot with the company's Android team.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:19.120]   Google TV was based on Honeycomb and a separate team that wasn't the Android team.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.560]   JENCO says, "I've been told by sources familiar with these discussions, there was some growing
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:30.000]   discontent between the Android team and the Google TV team as Google TV failed, floundered."
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.120]   So the Android team said, "Well, we're going to just do it right."
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.520]   And that was the Nexus Q, which of course was instantly killed.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.520]   But this much--
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.680]   Right, and the Nexus Q surprised the Google TV team.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.360]   I don't know if you guys remember, the Google TV team had no idea that the Q was happening.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.560]   And I think that they were dismayed.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.520]   Yeah, one surprise.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.320]   I think they probably said, "What the hell?"
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.680]   Well, it's a little bit like-- one hand's not talking to the other.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:01.340]   I mean, Honeycomb always felt like this red-headed stepchild of a forked branch that they just
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.520]   sort of rushed to production in order to get in the tablets faster.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.040]   And the whole splitting off the tee, I just don't-- this just feels like Ms. Manchin,
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.040]   the Q--
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:14.080]   The more I hear about Google, the more it is silos.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.680]   Eric Spitz, the bigger problem facing Google, when it becomes this big, and that's the problem
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.320]   that faces it today.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.320]   It's gigantic.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:27.040]   It feels like it's a side effect of a positive intention, which is to kind of maintain the
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.920]   startup mentality.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:36.640]   So by making small autonomous teams, the advantages, they all are running and gunning, but the
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.520]   disadvantages, they're not all running and gunning the same direction.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.800]   And the advantage, too, is that they can kill stuff off that's not working.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.360]   The wave team, for example, was totally separate, particularly geographically.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.400]   They were in Sydney, but they were completely separate.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.400]   They were on their own startup.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.480]   They hadn't sent those built around user acquisition that were separate from the rest
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.480]   of the company.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.680]   And the idea was, if you don't reach your goals, then we kill the product, right?
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.880]   And that's what happened with the Q, and it's what happened with Google TV.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.520]   It's hard as consumers and developers to be like, "Oh, this feels like the same thing
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.160]   with maybe a different interface.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.080]   How is this going to be different this time?
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   What did you learn?"
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.760]   And I think what you said, Leo, is true.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.240]   I just realized that I'm missing the new season of Louis.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   I had no idea it was airing, and I wound up actually just buying it off the Play Store
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.160]   and using it on the Chromecast, which was a really nice experience.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.480]   But it's true.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.320]   I just want to fire up my Android TV and say, "Hey, Google knows that I watch Louis, and
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.880]   that I love Louis, and that as soon as the premiere happens, I'm going to want to know
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.480]   about it, and it should just show me, and I'll buy it from wherever I don't care."
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   Content first.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.040]   We are interested in content.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.440]   We don't care about HBO or Showtime or anything.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.440]   We want content.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.400]   So Android TV has my Google Now, like the knowledge that Google Now has about what TV
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:51.280]   shows I like, because Google Now is incredibly good at telling me that my new favorite show
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.640]   has a new episode, because I tend to Google a lot while I'm watching TV.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.040]   You know, I look up stars, I look up in whatever plots, whatever.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.120]   If Android TV has that, that's going to be awesome.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.880]   I'm going to be able to turn that thing on.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.320]   And without my DVR, you know, have plenty of content that I'm going to want to watch,
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.200]   right, without having to remember to schedule or, you know, have a backlog or whatever.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   I'll just be able to stream.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.360]   And that would be a great experience.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.040]   And of course, Google has changed because Andy Rubens gone.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:24.120]   Cinder Pachai is now in charge of both things, right?
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:30.880]   So I feel like that some of the silos are also walls have been broken down.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.640]   Which means, well, can you have, but you can have both Chromecast and Android TV.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.880]   I'm sorry, Jeff, go ahead.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.440]   I forget what I was going to say.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.280]   I mean, I think you can, you can mis-manage silos.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.120]   You can mis-manage a monolith, right?
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.760]   Like mis-management can happen either way.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.760]   It doesn't feel like this was mis-management, but this is Google's way, right?
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   They build stuff.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.120]   A lot of it fails.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.640]   A lot of it is wildly successful.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:56.760]   They don't know what's going to stick and they, and they kill and they fail fast and
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.880]   then they start a new thing.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:03.200]   And, you know, so while things like the Nexus Q feel like this terrible PR, you know, blemish,
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   it's actually just like the way that it works for them, product-wise.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:11.120]   So no customer ever bought one, so nobody was the worst off.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   Right.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   Right.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   A lot of people got free ones.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.760]   It just means, you know, a lot of dirty jerks make snarky remarks around Google I/O.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.760]   But I think that they can afford that.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.760]   Oh, no, wait.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   It looks like another Q.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, make a Q.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.760]   That's dark.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   Right, right, right.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   It's me.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.320]   Anyway, so that's something to look for.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:33.000]   Now, it remains to be seen whether there's a standalone box like a Roku box or it's just
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.680]   a platform that they sell to TV manufacturers that they put in.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.400]   I would like to see that.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.880]   Got that's apps on TVs.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:44.560]   Even within the Samsung line, I have different experiences, you know, it just doesn't make
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.560]   any sense.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.560]   Yes.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.960]   It's really a mess.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.120]   And these guys are not good at developing apps.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.600]   They shouldn't be in this business.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.720]   The other thing I know I remember was going to say, the Nate Foundation held a big deal
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.520]   at the meeting at my school a month or so ago trying to kind of save public television,
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.160]   though, the young people in the room said, "Why?"
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.440]   But the thing that struck that I've quoted since is that they all said the big screen
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.200]   on the wall, that's the second screen.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   Yes.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.680]   I'm most engaged in the screen that's right in front of me.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.440]   And also the TV is right in the background.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   Oh, watch that for a while.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.440]   Okay, fine.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.040]   Or maybe talk about it for a while or not.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.120]   And I think that if you look at that way, how you tie the...
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.360]   The presumption was everything you had to get to the big screen because that was Valhalla.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.240]   No, not necessarily.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.160]   And the more you can tie what you're doing on the big screen to your truly engaged smaller
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.840]   screen, that's where there's going to be something here.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.560]   Google loves signals.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560]   No one, what you watch.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   So as Gina said, they can give you the cards to say your favorite thing is coming on.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.560]   And here's some more.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.560]   Here's where you can find it.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.960]   I see you're watching TV.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.640]   If you'd like me to help you, yes.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.560]   Could be for your TV.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.720]   I get that all the time.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.640]   Ah, I see a Panasonic TV is on and on the network.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   What are you watching?
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.640]   Press this button.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   Would you like me to send this on?
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   Yeah, that was a...
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   So cheese doodles to your home?
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   Yes.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   Cheese doodles.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.160]   And I'll use the automatic lock to unlock your house and let the robot in.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   We'll just put it on the counter.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160]   You don't have to get up.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.160]   [laughter]
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.680]   Will we see...
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.840]   Now Apple, I watch Stay Fallow on the back burner.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.640]   No mention at all.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.120]   So this is an opportunity for Google once again to start talking wearables.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.520]   But here too, Google's been talking of the OS, not the hardware.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.320]   Yeah, I think that's smart.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.960]   Be the platform, not the solution.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.120]   Do you think they'll ever have their own hardware?
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   They're showcase.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.920]   They seem to always, for some reason, I really understand Google does like to build hardware.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:02.800]   I think a lot of times though it's like the Pixel, their reference applications, right?
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   The Pixel was not a product.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   You want to make it work on a thing.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   Just so that people, real enthusiasts and Googlers could use it, right?
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.640]   So how big will glass be at I/O this year?
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   Ah.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   Ah.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   Good question.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.640]   And the person out there...
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   And the person out there...
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.600]   The product by Instinct says not big based on the merits, but they are behind this thing.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.160]   And they're pushing out updates like gangbusters.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.160]   Are they?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   They are.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   They are.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   Well that's interesting.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.400]   I mean that's the kind of thing you do before an event.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   Yes, yes.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.360]   One of the more interesting ones is this notification, I think it's called notification glance.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.600]   So if you get the notification sound and you glance up, it will wake the device and
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   show it to you.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   Oh, I love that.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   And when you look down.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   And it's kind of like...
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.600]   That's cool.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.600]   Come on.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   Does it kill the battery?
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.440]   Because it's got to be watching you all the time.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.440]   That's a good question.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440]   I mean how do we know you look up?
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   That's definitely one of the challenges.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440]   It must be one of the challenges.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   It must always be on.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]   Some part of it, right?
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   It has to be detecting that.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   But yeah.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.120]   I mean the Moto X found a way around.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.680]   I mean that you know they're always listening, always watching.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.520]   You know this is one of the challenges.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.120]   Well the challenge is it's only when you get a...
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.120]   Of course what Gina just said, I'm guessing you're...
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120]   It's when you get an update.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.600]   Maybe it goes on a little bit right then.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   Yeah right.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.440]   So you get the notifications down, you glance up and you glance down.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.520]   I would like to run this at Google I/O.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.040]   It's glasshold.sh.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:35.960]   It's a little bash script that looks at...
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:41.800]   It looks for any Google Glass attached to the local network and boots them.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.880]   What an ass.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:50.200]   And then it puts up glasshold discovered deauthorizing.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   So it will kick glass.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.040]   Talk about violating somebody's space and somebody's privacy.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.840]   This jerk is the one who's doing it.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.760]   Just because I have my glass on doesn't mean I want to photograph you whoever you are.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.360]   You can test your goal piece.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.400]   So I think one thing we're going to be seeing at Google I/O is a little fist fight between
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.400]   Jeff and Julian Oliver.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.640]   I mean, I hear you Jeff, but if you are the system...
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   It's your network.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.720]   You can kick any device off of the network, right?
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.280]   I mean, but I agree.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.920]   It's the same as whatever, walking into a bar with a universal remote that shuts off
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.960]   all the TVs and, you know...
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960]   I hate it.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.160]   Or the other thing is sometimes that way back when the theaters were going to block
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   cell phones and pagers, remember those?
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.480]   Well, what if there's a surgeon in the audience?
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   They need this.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.160]   He uses glass for emergency communications.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:47.000]   No, but what if somebody's in the theater using glass to get subtitles or something?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   Right.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   I don't know.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.320]   It's just a jerky thing to do to say, "I don't like that technology, so I'm going to
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.880]   ban it and I'm so friggin' clever.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.880]   No, you're not jerky."
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.880]   Right.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   Glass don't work that way.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   I'm getting more.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880]   You can see you use your data program.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880]   Right.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   Your data connection.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.320]   Yeah, I know how I feel about this.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:15.760]   There are scenarios where you would like to say, "This is off the record."
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   Well, fine.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.640]   You're going to see the person wearing this ridiculously huge thing even if it's designed
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   by Diane Vollum.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.040]   So you could then say them or something?
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   Could you please take them?
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040]   Please don't.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]   You know what, Leo?
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:31.600]   Even without glass, I have things called eyes and ears and a memory.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.280]   And you have to tell somebody something's off the record based on that.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   The technology.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.760]   Yeah, but there's a big difference between Mitt Romney telling prospective voters in a
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:53.720]   private session, 40% of all the electorate is freeloading losers.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.360]   And then somebody were beating that.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.040]   And then somebody having a video of it, there's a big difference.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:03.080]   Yeah, and I think it's all the better if they have the video.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.080]   I can.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:10.880]   I wouldn't hang your hat on that one, Leo, because that's a public official.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.520]   So it was okay to record that because he's a public official, even though it's a private
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.520]   meeting.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:22.960]   Like, if I'm a public official, anything I do ever can be recorded and put on the Internet
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.280]   depends on whether it has newsworthy value.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.960]   I don't know if I want to live in that world.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.200]   If a candidate for president of the United States calls 40% of the country, lazy oafs,
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200]   that's newsworthy period.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.440]   And again, same thing as somebody in that room hears him say it and comes out and says,
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.320]   you're not going to believe what he said.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.200]   And they report that as a journalist, I support that openness.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.640]   If you happen to also record it, bonus points.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.640]   That's all.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   Did you know?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.920]   I know that here's one you're going to love then.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:07.320]   Using Google Glass to shoot guns around corners.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:13.680]   This is a program called tracking point that turns Google Glass into a remote site for
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.760]   aiming around corners.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.080]   So here's a guy.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.080]   He wore glass.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:24.000]   He basically used glass to take a video of what he's going to shoot at and then aims
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.720]   around the corner using some stuff.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.440]   Of course, you could also put just put a monitor on his gun.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.000]   It's dumb.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.800]   And this almost feels like it's intent.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   It's like Adjut prop.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.320]   Like somebody who doesn't like glass made this.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   Like look, glass kills.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.320]   To scare people.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   Is that how you say it, Jeff?
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320]   Adjut prop?
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.320]   Agit prop.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:53.320]   Probably some Germanic pronunciation for it.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.920]   There's all get those liberals scared.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.240]   It's like insurgents also use it to save lives.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.240]   Right.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   Like it's just a tool.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.120]   You can use it lots of different ways.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.720]   Glass is really I have to say has been a wonderful magnet for stories and that's a good
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.120]   thing to know like it.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   It has.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:23.240]   Diane von Furstenberg, we know as DVF is making 13 new ladies frames and shades for Google
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   Glass.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.800]   DVF made for Glass Collection will be out on the 23rd.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:39.880]   You could as a glass explorer, you can buy them at the official Glassdoor or at netaporte.com.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.040]   I'm not going to ask.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.160]   I'm not going to be sexist and say Gina, do you want these?
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.880]   I'm going to say, Jeff, do you want these?
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   Oh.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.320]   I think having a designer frame on such a dorky thing.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.720]   The problem is it doesn't you can dress up a pig.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.760]   You can put lipstick on it.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.600]   It's like it's really nice except for that giant thing.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   I love these frames.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.080]   But what the hell is that thing over your temple?
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.440]   That how it makes your trick your head all the time.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.640]   It would be really nice if the arm is bent.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.160]   Fireman can save lives using Google Glass or shoot around corners.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.600]   You take your choice.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.760]   It's been a great year talking about glass.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.760]   I hope it doesn't go away.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.400]   In fact, I would love to see Google make a big announcement at I/O, something like, we
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.640]   are now ready to start selling glasses of consumer product.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.120]   302-water-box a lot.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.400]   What do you want to waste it?
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   200 bucks.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   Well, you know what?
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.480]   That's the price you paid for being able to be a glass hole a year earlier than the rest
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480]   of us.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.240]   So should I wear my glass at I/O?
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.240]   Oh, well, right.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.880]   Don't you, hasn't ever-- didn't you last year?
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   No.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.520]   I mean, it's one of the few places that you can wear it and not worry about people not
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.880]   understanding what it is.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   Right.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.440]   I always just feel bad that the convention center, like every single person has at least
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.480]   five devices on them that's connecting to the Wi-Fi.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.280]   Oh, I know.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.280]   Will they give out glass?
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   No.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   Free at I/O?
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.280]   Look under your chair.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280]   What will they give out?
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.320]   What fun gadgets will they give out?
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.280]   Somebody at Google told me that we'll be pleased.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   That's all I know.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280]   That's good.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.280]   No, that is--
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.440]   Because one school of thought would be, you know, this is becoming a problem that a lot
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.920]   of losers who aren't really developers are trying to get into I/O just so they can get
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.360]   the free stuff.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.920]   And maybe we should knock this off and do like Apple does and just say, hey, this is
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.960]   for developers.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.800]   You're here because you want to learn how to develop.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.800]   That's what I would--
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.800]   The T-shirt isn't that enough.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800]   Here's a T-shirt.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   Get out and get away.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.560]   Well, you know, there's lots of stuff-- well, it could be a Nexus 10.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.720]   Could-- well, long-awaited, not delivered.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.160]   Could be a Nexus 6 or whatever, the equivalent phone.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.240]   It could be Glass.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.680]   Glass, a watch, Android TV.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.680]   Watch.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.520]   Yeah, I started this off with watches.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.520]   Is there a Google watch?
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   Is there a Google watch?
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.720]   I think I'm just hoping a nest.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   A nest.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   No, I mean, even if it were buy a nest for a while.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   Can I just--
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   It's probably going to be something that's early.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.000]   Can I ask you a question?
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   I remember this story.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.600]   It went around that Nest was going to put ads on there.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.840]   And I remember Tony Fiddell saying, we're never going to do that.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   Right.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   That was a bogus story, right?
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   It was.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.800]   There were two bogus stories at the same time, which means I think Nest has a bit of a PR
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   issue.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.800]   I think it was in some kind of filing.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   And he said, no.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800]   Maybe it's because it's possible.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   It doesn't mean we're going to do it.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.800]   We're not going to do it.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.120]   Because everybody and their brother, several times this week on Twitter on various shows
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120]   I've had to say, no, no, no, that wasn't--
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.840]   There were two bogus stories.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.840]   And you corrected the one--
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.640]   People believed it.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   There was a big second recall, which was only the bureaucracy catching up to the actual--
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   And that was another one.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   We talked to that.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.720]   --and the way that was the story about ads.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.040]   So both of them bogus.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   That's the sign of--
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   People believed it.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.040]   Anything.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   How do you like to go?
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   Jaron Lanier wrote a piece with the Guardian.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.520]   Say he likes self-driving cars because they'll be safer.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.200]   But then of course, going through all kinds of hand-wringing worry about Google.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.760]   You know, you want them to drive us?
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   Well, that's Jaron.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:12.240]   Jaron, who was a virtual reality advocate very early on, has a very nice set of dreadlocks,
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.920]   has become an anti-technology guy in recent years.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   Yes, in ice-cives.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.240]   But I'd damn well rather have Google drive me than Microsoft.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.160]   I have Microsoft in my car.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.240]   I'm not sure really how happy I am about that.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.240]   I am--
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.720]   Is that the sense of the puts you in the water?
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.320]   No, that is not.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.320]   That's Q and X.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.040]   That's comes from Blackberry's rim.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.960]   The Audi has Q and X's operating system.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.920]   The Mustang has Microsoft car.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920]   All right.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.080]   And actually, the Mustang works pretty well.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.000]   And the Audi's fixed.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.960]   So there.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.120]   I'm very sad to see this.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:56.520]   Google is going to close the Texas factory in Fort Worth where they build the Moto X.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.200]   The one of the things I loved about the Moto X was it was a phone made in the-- or assembled
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.120]   in the United States.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.000]   By the end of the year, they'll be closing the factory.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.160]   Of course, Google has sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   I had some hope that those 700 Texas workers who were assembling Moto X phones there would
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.920]   keep their jobs, I guess not.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.280]   That's a bummer.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.720]   I think that's so sense.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.880]   And this is happening before the transition.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   Google's doing this.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.360]   But you know, that's actually not unusual now that I think of it.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.880]   And the sale of a company, you often fire everybody.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.480]   You clean up your messes.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:38.000]   And then if the new company wants to rehire, then that's up to them.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.880]   But I would guess that Google has already said to Lenovo, "You want to keep this factory?"
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.920]   And they said, "No, fire them all, please."
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.480]   We don't want-- because otherwise, Lenovo would pay the severance and the, you know,
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.640]   face the lawsuits and all that.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   So it's going to be the current owner that lays off.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.000]   Oh, that's so sad.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.400]   Weak sales, high costs, that's what they're saying.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.040]   It is.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:10.280]   At its peak, they've employed 3,800 people today, only about 700.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.840]   So apparently--
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.120]   It's a high cost, isn't surprising.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.080]   But the weak sales, that's disturbing for other reasons.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.440]   Strategy analytics says-- now, Google isn't saying how many Moto Xs were sold, but strategy
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.400]   analytics says fewer than a million, about 900,000.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:32.960]   Comparing to the Apple iPhone, which sold 26 million units in the same period.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   Of the--
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.960]   Of the--
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   Of one, of the 5S.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   Of course.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   Samsung would be even more.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.480]   I really like that phone.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:48.960]   I think we're going to think back and say those were the days, my friends, like that.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   I don't know.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.400]   I guess the Moto X plus one will be made in China like everything else.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:15:04.200]   12,000 people in the first day has to be forgotten in Europe.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.520]   And by now, it is more than 40,000.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.960]   How does Google do this?
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   It's just ridiculous.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.880]   And the idea among the many ironies is that they've only made Google more powerful.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.280]   Because now Google's going to be the arbiter of what's relevant, what's bad, what's this,
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   that?
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.040]   And it's just ridiculous.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.880]   It's really a scary, scary ruling.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.360]   There's no opportunity for appeal.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.800]   It's done.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.400]   So something like 10,000 requests a day, just kind of boom, boom, boom.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.280]   Well, how many takedown requests did they get from DMCA?
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.440]   Oh, far fewer than that.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.440]   Right.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.440]   Fewer than that.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   Far fewer than that.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.040]   I mean, I hear you and I agree that the ruling is troubling, but I mean, Google deals
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.200]   with spam and takedown requests from big companies all the time.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.160]   So I'm sure that they've got to make a judgment, Gina.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.080]   They're going to make a human qualitative judgment, not whether this is infringing material.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.800]   Was this created by Disney or not?
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.880]   But this is said, kick it back to the court though, if it was unclear.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   It's up to Google.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.160]   There is no absolute right to have the information deleted.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.880]   Google will have to weigh a number of criteria in responding to the requests, including relevance
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.960]   and time passed.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:30.400]   This comes from an article in PC World by Jennifer Baker.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.440]   Google quote, Google has needs to work out what a reasonable consumer might find outdated.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   This is not straightforward.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.640]   And if they do not anticipate, they will have too many requests.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.200]   What a mess.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.160]   What a mess.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   Now I am a little sympathetic because I mean, there's stuff I would love to be forgotten
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160]   on the internet.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.440]   Don't we all have that?
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.800]   It doesn't have to be untrue.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.600]   This is something very important to underscore.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.000]   It can be true.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.960]   It's rewriting history, right?
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.640]   I mean, if it's untrue, you have recourse with libel and so forth.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.560]   You can go to the source and say that's not true.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.320]   You have to take that down.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.440]   Well, somebody asked too, whether they're, you know, somebody has suggested in a comment
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:22.760]   when I wrote about this, that one step that should have been in here is to demonstrate
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.720]   to Google that you went to the source to try to get it down there and failing that.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.480]   I would be good.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.080]   Did you try the guy who posted it?
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:39.920]   Peter Houst thinks the European data protection supervisor is happy with Google's online form.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.800]   He says, yeah, Google is organizing itself, which is welcome.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.280]   I don't know what country he's from.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:51.440]   Because ruling means the search engine needs, that was just a generic Eastern European accent.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:55.360]   The ruling means that the search engine needs to anticipate what the reasonable expectation
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.000]   of a consumer might be.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.480]   Oh, you go vault.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.480]   That's a terrible thing.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:04.400]   What I pray happens, what I really want to see happen is that a link to a site gets pulled
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.160]   down and the holder of that site sues.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.080]   Oh, great.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.120]   On the basis of the, well, no, I want to see a ballast to this decision.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.440]   I want people to try to sue to protect their free speech.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:22.520]   The right to remember discussed on the show before, it's not going to be in the US.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:30.720]   All you have to do is go search on Google.com, not.de or FR, and you'll find anything.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.240]   This is only holds in the European countries.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:38.460]   Yeah, I mean, what somebody needs to do is build like an extension or a bookmarklet that
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:43.520]   actually highlights the results on Google.com that had been forgotten on other search engines
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.080]   because that'll make it highlight things of particular interest.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   But in terms of determining relevance.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   That's a good idea.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.280]   And it would be easy to do.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.240]   I mean, you know, no longer on Google.de or whatever.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.720]   Oh, my God, that's a great idea.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.560]   No one can do anything about that.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.920]   No, I mean, it would certainly make those results.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.480]   I'd love to know what's been, you know, a straw European search engine and that would
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.280]   be a pretty trivial programming wise.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.480]   But in terms of determining relevance, I mean, that's what Google does, right?
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.120]   Like that's what Google does every day in every search.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   But it does automatically.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.320]   This is going to be a team of people who will review every request.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.760]   Yeah, just the guy who caused the case and as John Oliver said, now the only thing the
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.240]   world knows about it was the thing he doesn't want known.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.560]   So is his foreclosure years ago relevant?
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.040]   Well, what the hell does it mean?
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.040]   A relevant to whom?
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.440]   If I'm, you know, hire the guy, I wonder if I can cross it or not.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.280]   If I want to give him a loan or go into business with him, yes, relevant to me.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.080]   If I want to go out and date with him, well, maybe still relevant.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:54.040]   But if I want to, you know, so there will be some of my skis, no, it's not relevant.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.400]   It will be removed from contextual.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.200]   The, you have to be in the EU and it will only be in the EU versions.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:05.520]   The search results will still be available in other jurisdictions, including the US.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.560]   There will be a notice at the bottom of each page that will say this was removed into the
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.560]   right to be forgotten act.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:17.600]   Oh, that'll make it really easy to do what Jesus suggests that.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.160]   All you've got to do is do a diff between those two pages then, right?
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   Oh, thank you.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.160]   That's great.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.080]   I mean, just like it, you know, get an array of URLs, you know, and compare them to the
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.960]   array of URLs that you get on the other, you know, it's a double request.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.760]   Anyway, I didn't mean to start.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.080]   But yeah, it would be pretty trivial.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.480]   Google has shared information about what kinds of requests they're getting.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:50.080]   31% of the requests were for fraudulent or scam incident reports that they want removed.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.400]   Of course, if you are a fraudster, you would want that removed, but just, I don't know
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.200]   if that's in the public interest.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.320]   20% are reports of violent or serious crime arrests.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:05.800]   12% are for child pornography arrests.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.440]   So more than 63% of these are for crimes.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.560]   Well, there's a different attitude.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.240]   In the US, we take people who've been arrested but not tried yet on perp locks in front of
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240]   news cameras.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240]   Yeah, we do, don't we?
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.560]   In Europe, they put, you know, they block the eyes.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.800]   So if you block my eyes, but you're still right.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:27.800]   That's me.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.720]   And after you've served your sentence, then you could have something in expunged in Europe.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.480]   And you can't, in some cases, the US as well.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.920]   You can have a record expunged.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:42.120]   But the fact of what you did.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.280]   This is fitting.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.960]   You know who's on the board, the advisory board that will review the process for Google?
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   Jimmy Wales.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.600]   Who himself has a few things he wanted removed.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:00.840]   Eric Schmidt, David Drummond, Google's legal counsel, Frank LaRue, who's a UN special
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.520]   reporter in the promotion and protection of the right of freedom of opinion and expression.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.880]   Peggy Valke, director of the University of Louvain Law School.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:15.280]   Jose Luis Pignar, the former head of Spain's Data Protection Authority, Jimmy Wales, an
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.680]   ethics professor at Oxford, Luciana Floridie.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.120]   They didn't ask us.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.120]   Didn't ask me.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.760]   Oh, I want to fill out the form.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.760]   You want to just ask for something?
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.920]   You got to go do something.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.680]   Did you watch the John Oliver thing on?
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.680]   We should play that.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.680]   It was very, very good.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.680]   I thought it was so far the best.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   Do you want to go to some effort?
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.480]   I still want to form the FCC.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.480]   That's right.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.920]   Don't fill out this form.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.720]   John Oliver did it.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.400]   And we won't play it today, but I will refer people to John Oliver's very, very good description
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:54.320]   of the net neutrality proposals by the FCC, which he called it.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   What was it?
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:02.120]   I can't repeat the phrase he used, but cable company, FRE, they were to present it.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.960]   He said the internet's not broken and the FCC is going to fix that.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   Yes.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.880]   Really well done.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   He said, "Trolls of the earth."
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.480]   He gave it a great, funny thing on trolls.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:18.360]   Now is your opportunity to use your skills for good, go troll the FCC, and indeed they
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.200]   did so much that it tore down the FCC's comment servers.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.840]   I'm not sure that's a good response.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.320]   Sad to hear.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.800]   Good on you, John Oliver.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.520]   It took him a while, but a couple of weeks after the proposals, yes, there it is.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.760]   It's on YouTube.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.200]   Search for his new show last week tonight and his segment on net neutrality.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.000]   It's a very, very good segment for us.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.560]   His HBO is posted.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.040]   Pass it around, please.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.280]   I've got a lot of tweets and so forth.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:56.360]   Preventing cable company, FRE.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.920]   I love John Oliver, and I'm glad that he did that.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.920]   Leo, if you're in the U, would you submit to the form the things that you would luish
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.560]   the internet for your head forgotten about you?
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.160]   No, on principle, I would bite the bullet and say, but I know somebody who would.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:16.640]   On principle, I would bite the bullet and say, look, you know, but I also understand
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.640]   the other side.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:24.520]   A close friend has spent a lot of time and effort to put other stuff up on the internet
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:30.720]   so that search results from Google don't point exclusively to negative reports.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:37.160]   I understand that the human motive, I just think that the court didn't balance the rights
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.440]   of knowledge, free speech, and memory.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.560]   Well, my feeling is if it's untrue, pursue libel, if it's true.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.680]   They're not very scutroty country in the US.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.480]   That's the truth.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.960]   Well, you're right.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   You're right.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960]   You also have to prove damage.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.960]   You have to prove other things.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.960]   Right.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   Well, there's damage.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   Well, anyway, yeah.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.960]   Okay.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.960]   I think those are reasonable standards.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:04.080]   If you could prove it's untrue and there's damage, then that, then, but the laws exist
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080]   for that.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:10.240]   If it actually happened or there's no damage, I think there's no right to pull it off the
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.240]   internet.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.760]   So for getting child pornography and debts and things, I mean, if you look at the Snapchat
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:21.480]   founder or Zuckerberg saying things when they were 19 or 20 years old that they wished
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.760]   that the internet had forgotten, right?
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.120]   Like having to apologize as men now for being teenagers and teenage boys and talking, whatever,
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.880]   talking in a way that most teenage boys would just talk in a locker room and there wouldn't
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880]   be a record of it, right?
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.800]   But these folks are very successful founders now and they...
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.360]   But isn't it a real sort of genius to our judgment of them as people?
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.600]   I think that we've got this discussed before.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.600]   You want to...
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.600]   Yeah, we have.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   Two among us doesn't have regrets.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.160]   We all have regrets about things that happened in the past.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160]   Absolutely.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.160]   Life does not provide a mechanism to erase those things we regret.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160]   But...
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.160]   I wish I could go to some people on the internet.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]   No, life didn't.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:05.880]   But before the internet, the internet is a particular kind of memory that has never existed
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   before, right?
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.760]   But we'll tell stories, word of mouth, right?
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:13.440]   It was a different thing than having a file that lived out there forever, right?
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.160]   Like our technology isn't built to deal with information and passing information, saving
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.560]   information and forgetting information the way that we collectively do as a culture
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.800]   in a community, right?
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.840]   So I mean, I think that's the issue.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.920]   As our technology doesn't forget, we do forget.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.320]   So we were in this weird space where somebody, you know, a photo of someone as a kid doing
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.120]   something stupid looks just as real and current and up to date as, you know, who they are
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.120]   today.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.280]   And like I get what you're saying, Jeff, of course, like I'm not going to hold Zuck accountable
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.400]   for saying the things that he said when he was 20 years old.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.800]   Although I got to tell you that doesn't...
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.360]   I didn't forget about that.
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.240]   I mean, I forgave but didn't forget, you know?
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.240]   I mean, there was a time when he...
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.880]   That's the key.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.800]   It's what you do with the knowledge you have.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   It's the...
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.800]   Right.
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.280]   It goes back to what David Boyd told me.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.520]   It's not the gathering, it's the use.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:08.160]   And what you're doing is you're deciding when to be tolerant, when to look past, and when
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.920]   to find an openness to the knowledge that people make mistakes.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.760]   And that's what society has to do.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.600]   Internet or no, we've got to be able to forgive people for screwing up because we all do.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   Right.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.040]   But it was about a time, right?
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.440]   It's about time that's passed.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.240]   It was Zuckerberg who said those things now, it would be a huge problem for his company,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240]   right?
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.840]   It was a long time ago, but people remember them.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.880]   Well, what if I said something racist?
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.520]   I hope I haven't.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520]   But what if I...
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.520]   And then I wanted to run...
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.000]   40 years later, I run for office.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   Is that relevant?
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   It was...
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.160]   See, this whole relevance test at the time, you know, right now, is it relevant?
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.160]   Google can take it down?
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.160]   No, the guy's not a racist.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.000]   It's been 20 years, I'll find take it down.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.800]   Then suddenly I'm running for Congress, should I?
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.960]   It's a good question.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   It's a good question.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.960]   And a lot of people think...
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.960]   And it's a good question.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   And I think it's a good question.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.960]   And I think it's a good question.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.960]   And I think it's a good question.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:11.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:15.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:17.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.960]   I think it's a good question.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960]   But see, that's cute and charming.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960]   And a Snapchat.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   Today I saw Peter Dinklage's, you know,
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.960]   mullet high school yearbook picture.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.960]   It was funny.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:34.960]   It was cute, right?
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   But like...
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960]   Peter might not think it's so cute or funny, right?
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:38.960]   He might not like it.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   And he'd have the right to have you forget it.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.960]   But I think things like racist remarks or...
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   It's tough.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.960]   And I often feel like I wish that our technology
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960]   didn't automatically, by default,
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960]   remember everything perfectly.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   Because our memories don't.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960]   So there's a...
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.960]   Again, I think we have to...
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.960]   What we have to do is figure out, as a society,
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.960]   what to forgive and when to forgive it.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   And try to rewrite history is not the way to do it.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.960]   Because it creates a precedent and a tool that's been used
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.960]   by tyrannical governments for rewrite reality.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.960]   It's such a tough one.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.960]   This is such a tough one.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.960]   I don't think there's...
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.960]   It's so hard.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.960]   And it encourages intolerance.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:21.960]   Yes.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:22.960]   Yes.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:23.960]   I hear you.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.960]   Although I gotta say,
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.960]   when pictures of you are posted on Reddit that look like that...
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.960]   (laughter)
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:32.960]   It's cute.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   Come on, tell me that's amazing.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   So somebody posted Lannister on the front in Dothraki in the back.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.960]   (laughter)
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.960]   God bless you, Reddit.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.960]   God bless you!
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.960]   (laughter)
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960]   Now there's something he's guilty of.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.960]   He really is guilty of.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   Somebody said, and love it.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:00.960]   Let us...
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   I'm just looking what else we have to talk about so much,
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.960]   but I think we're kind of running out of time here.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.960]   YouTube is also waiting on the net neutrality issue.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.960]   Of course, there'll be one of the companies that will be asked
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.960]   for money from ISPs who want to start a fast lane.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   And so they have released a US-focused version of their video quality report,
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:32.960]   which lets you check which ISPs produce the best-looking YouTube streams.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   So I can see here...
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:35.960]   Oh!
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   Wow!
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.960]   (laughter)
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.960]   That after...
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.960]   Wow.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:46.960]   It looks like it starts to really go up in the afternoon
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.960]   and by 9 o'clock at night.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:54.960]   That is a lot of video consumption right there.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.960]   He says, "Users on YouTube HD verified networks,
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.960]   though this is something new, HD verified.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.960]   Should expect smooth playback most of the time.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   Compare providers in your area."
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   That's...
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.960]   So Comcast is HD verified.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   But obviously that means YouTube is paying the money, right?
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:18.960]   AT&T, U-verse, Sonic Net.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   Very interesting.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.960]   The clear point, and this is the point, of course,
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:29.960]   John Oliver makes in his show, is that over 90% of Americans only have two choices
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   for internet service.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:36.960]   It's not like you have a chance, a choice to go somewhere better.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.960]   Amazon is going to have a device launch.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.960]   We mentioned this, they put out an invitation and an announcement.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   Come June 18th, we'll probably be covering this in Seattle.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:53.960]   A 3D display of some kind.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:59.960]   According to Recode, it's a 3D phone display.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:05.960]   Now I thought that the rumor that Amazon was going to do a 3D phone seemed very far-fetched.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.960]   But apparently that's what we're going to see on the 18th.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   Amazon is not sending invitations but inviting those who want to attend to a client
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   and watch the people using whatever this device is.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   Whoa!
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   That's really cool.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   Turning their heads.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   Very real life.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   Another news, Amazon released a video where actors act like they're looking at a product.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.960]   That's really neat.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.960]   Whoa!
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   Something like that.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.960]   Oh my gosh, that's crazy.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.960]   That's super awesome.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.960]   I don't know how you guys do it.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.960]   It's pretty flawless and seamless.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.960]   Wow.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:43.960]   There's one guy pivoting on his lips like that.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:44.960]   How does it do that?
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.960]   That's pretty good.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.960]   That, um, press.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:51.960]   That's a pretty damn intuitive.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:52.960]   That's really cool.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:53.960]   Pretty damn intuitive.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.960]   Charlie Robes commanded to say, "Whoa!"
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.960]   Whoa!
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:57.960]   My drone?
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.960]   I have to go back.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   Hmm.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   And Jen Shagger is actually right.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   There was a great piece in the New York Times this last week about Harvard Business School.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:12.960]   And I think it was Clayton Christensen got in a room to record a lecture for online education.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.960]   He looked around and he saw that the students were attractive.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:17.960]   No.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.960]   Really attractive.
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   And he finally just asked, "Are you students?"
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.960]   "Oh no, we're actors."
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.960]   Wow.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.960]   Wow.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   This is, I think, really an innovation here.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:35.960]   They're posted on the Amazon.com/launchevent.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   You request an invitation.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   Where is it going to be held?
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   Seattle, would you work?
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   Request an invitation and I'll fly you out there.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:48.960]   And what you, and Jen say, "I want to wear my glass during this."
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.960]   I'll fly in enough, man.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.960]   Who could we send up there?
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.960]   Jason, you want to go to Seattle on the 18th?
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:56.960]   Jason should go.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   We'll send Jason.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.960]   You have three choices.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.560]   Are you an Amazon customer, a developer, or a journalist?
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.520]   And then you can do an optional video submission saying why you should attend.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.960]   Jesus, why you want to go to a flack event?
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.360]   God.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360]   And it's right on the front page of Amazon there.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.120]   Would you want an invite to a new device we're unveiling?
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.320]   This is going to be the phone.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.960]   Look at the edge of it.
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   This is a phone.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960]   Don't they?
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.960]   They don't want Amazon dead to Android in the Kindle.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.960]   I'm never buying an Amazon phone.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.960]   No.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.960]   And really, I don't know why you would want a 3D display on a phone.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.960]   What?
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:38.960]   I mean...
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.960]   Oh, so I can go like this.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.960]   So Jesus' eyes can follow you.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:43.960]   Yes.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.960]   There you go.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:45.960]   I'm looking at you.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:48.960]   I'm wearing glass and we're using that.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.960]   Ooh.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   Ooh.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   Ummm.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:52.960]   Ummm.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.960]   I think that's all we're going to do.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.960]   Unless you guys have anything important.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.960]   Because we still have our tool apps.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.960]   I like tool apps.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.960]   And number and Jeff is exhausted.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.960]   Let's talk about full-sale university.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.960]   And education is so important.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:16.960]   And if you want to have a good career in our modern world, it would be very smart to become,
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.960]   especially if you want to be a marketer, proficient at web-based tools and techniques to reach audiences
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.960]   and consumers in a digital environment.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.960]   Web-based channels, search technologies, analytics, SEO, all of these things.
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:36.960]   Full-sale university offers online courses towards an Internet Marketing Masters degree
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:38.960]   covering these technologies.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.960]   SEO, social media marketing, web metrics analytics, online consumer behavior.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:50.960]   You'll be working in a great environment with real projects and real clients with industry experienced instructors.

[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:54.960]   Gina Trapani has an Easter egg tip.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.960]   I love Easter egg tips.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.960]   I know I'm a sucker for Easter eggs.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.960]   They're not the most useful things in the world, but they're fun.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.960]   Google's always got a bunch of them.
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:09.960]   There's a new one in Google Maps that tells you how long it will take to travel by Loch Ness Monster.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:17.960]   You have to search for directions from a certain fort Augustus to a certain castle.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   In dramaturgata, in the wilderness.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.960]   Thank you Leo.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.960]   And then there will be a little egg in the route options area.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.960]   If you see it, click on route options.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:34.960]   And there's an egg.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.960]   Where, where, where, where, where, where, where.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.960]   Are you doing it or am I doing it?
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   You're doing it.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.960]   I'm currently doing it.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.960]   Well, I'm currently doing it too.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:44.960]   So there.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960]   Best route.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]   So what do I click on?
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   Best route fewer transfers?
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.960]   Yeah, I've been walking.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.960]   See, less walking.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.960]   Let's do this.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.960]   Let's do less walking.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.960]   There's an Easter egg right here.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.960]   And I can go via Loch Ness Monster.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.960]   What the heck?
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.960]   28 minutes.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.960]   Oh, in fact, if you click the Easter egg, you'll see other ones.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.960]   Other ones that you can see.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.960]   So it's 28 minutes by Loch Ness Monster.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.960]   I would like to go by dragon, please.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.960]   I wonder if Google Earth would actually show Nessie on that trip.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   No, apparently not.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.960]   So you'll be going, is that Loch Ness?
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.960]   You'll be traveling from Fort Augustus to her court castle?
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:29.960]   Huh.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960]   I like it.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:32.960]   Yeah, I thought it was cute.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.960]   Hey, Jeff, wake up.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.960]   It's time for your number of the week.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:37.960]   All right.
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:38.960]   I'm glad you did this one.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:39.960]   You should do this one.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:40.960]   I'll do this one.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.960]   So Google to its credit.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.960]   Is that dragon?
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.960]   Yeah, that's by dragon.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   Oh, my God.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.960]   Nice.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.960]   Where am I going?
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.960]   You are going from Snowden to breach in beacons?
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.960]   I'm not sure.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960]   I'm not sure where that is.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960]   This is a--
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.960]   From a boy genius report article.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.960]   Snowden to brick in beacons.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.960]   Make sure you go through the best route, which is dragon.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.960]   Wow.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.960]   Wow.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.960]   It's fly by the other hand.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.960]   That's strange.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.960]   As the dragon flies.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.960]   It's only 21 minutes.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.960]   If you take a car, it's three hours.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.960]   Oh, take the dragon.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:18.960]   They're expensive, but they're worth it.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:20.960]   Little hard to read.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.960]   And they're--
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.960]   They're a little hot.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.960]   Where your flame proof underwear.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.960]   What does it say?
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960]   Where your flame proof gear?
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.960]   Little boy.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:30.960]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:31.960]   Your number.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.960]   So Google to its credit revealed its diversity numbers.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.960]   And fully confessing to work on this.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.960]   To their credit because they're not good.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.960]   70% male and 61% white.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.960]   And more details in that.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.960]   And this is a constant conversation in my field as well in journalism.
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.960]   Where to try to, for example, encourage--
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.960]   And we're not going to city university.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   To get more, for example, black males, Hispanic males in my field.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.960]   To get the diversity.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.960]   If you pointed, there is very hard.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:14.960]   Given Gwen, I imagine a lot of the minorities at Google are international minorities.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:19.960]   So we don't have any hard things working here.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.960]   We have extended job offers to several, but they keep saying no.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.960]   I don't know why.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.960]   Petaluma, no thanks.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.960]   Yeah, some of it may be Petaluma.
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.960]   But no, I think it is a problem in general.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   Yeah, it is. And actually credit to Google to say this.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.960]   Because I think what it does too is it also influences policy and scholarship funds at schools and things like that.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:46.960]   To say that Google wants a bigger pool of talent to hire from as do we.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.960]   And it requires explicit action.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:55.960]   It starts-- yeah, it starts in education and opportunities.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.960]   Yeah, it can't start.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.960]   It's a number for publishing their numbers.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.960]   I applaud them because the numbers did not-- they were like, wow.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.960]   Yeah, but if I think about it, I mean, I think that's probably how Silicon Valley is in general.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.960]   Yeah, I mean, when folks are saying, oh, that's the TV show Silicon Valley, like there's no women.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.960]   It's like, yeah, it's making fun of what it is.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.960]   They even said that.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   They go to tech crunch and say, now, guys, they're at tech crunch disrupt.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.960]   The male to female ratio is now 15% female.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.960]   You're going to be careful now. You could lose your heads.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.960]   There was a picture of the men's room or the bathroom line at WWDC.
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.960]   Oh, yeah, this is a couple seconds.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:43.960]   Well, I mean, that's one advantage. The bathroom is always clean and empty when you're a woman.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.960]   This is the Worldwide Developers Conference last year.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.960]   And then this year it was a little bit-- it was a little bit better.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:52.960]   So this is this year.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:54.960]   So, nope. I don't see any women.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:55.960]   No.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.960]   A long line though for the men's room.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.960]   This year, the same picture, a little bit longer line.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.960]   Oh, here's the best one. This was last year.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.960]   I'm really happy this conversation is happening.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.960]   And I hope it continues to happen.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:14.960]   We just got to do that.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:15.960]   And I'm glad that it's coming from the top.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:16.960]   We got to do better.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:18.960]   We got to do better. And that's been widely sort of acknowledged.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.960]   And this is part of it. And I'm happy.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.960]   I'm happy when people are talking about it.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960]   Good.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:23.960]   Me too.
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.960]   I'm really excited for my tool with something that's been out on iOS
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.960]   for some time.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.960]   And I've just now got it for Android.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:32.960]   And I'm really happy.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.960]   I think it's one of the best calendar apps I've ever used.
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:35.960]   It's called Sunrise.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.960]   Calendar by Sunrise.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:43.960]   It is now available free on Android and on your desktop,
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.960]   which is kind of cool too.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.960]   So let me show you.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.960]   I'll show you on my phone.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:52.960]   I don't know how well it can you see my phone?
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.960]   It's got a very nice user interface.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.960]   It's got month interface.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.960]   It's got day.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:42:59.960]   It's got week.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:05.960]   It puts icons next to people's names and makes the links hot links.
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.960]   It puts in maps.
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:12.960]   It does a lot of very nice things, I think, that make your calendar
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.960]   very pretty and highly functional.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:19.960]   These are all my invitations that I have not yet said yes to.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.960]   Here's the week view.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   Just really nice.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.960]   And what I really like about it, of course, it's very easy to use
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:28.960]   with Google Calendar.
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:30.960]   You just sign into your Google Calendar and it automatically
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.960]   populates.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.960]   And they have a very nice web-based version of this as well.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.960]   So if you go to the web-based version, which is in the calendar
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.960]   dot Sunrise dot AM.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.960]   And this is free, by the way.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.960]   You can connect with Google.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:44.960]   I'm going to connect with Google.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.960]   It will download my calendar.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.960]   And it gives you a really, I think, attractive month by month
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.960]   interface on your desktop.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.960]   Almost eliminated the need for a desktop calendar app, frankly.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.960]   I really like it.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.960]   They've done a stellar job, I think, of giving you a calendar.
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.960]   So it's called Sunrise.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.960]   Sunrise dot AM, iOS, now Android and desktop.
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.960]   That's my tool of the week.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.960]   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   This has been a fun twig.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.960]   Jeff, thank you for, as always, making the extra effort to be
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.960]   here in a foreign land.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.960]   I move heaven, earth, and sonotales.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.960]   Well, we're very grateful to you for that.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.960]   Yeah, thanks, Jeff.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:29.960]   And I hope you get your time.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.960]   What time is it?
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.960]   It's 11 there, right?
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.960]   No, it's midnight.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.960]   Oh, it's midnight.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960]   Okay, sorry.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960]   Well, we'll get you to bed because you have a speech tomorrow.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.960]   Get to be by time.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.960]   Please give everybody at the Google, the big Google tent, our
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.960]   regards.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.960]   We'll do.
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.960]   And Jeff, of course, is a professor of journalism at CUNY in
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.960]   New York on Times Square.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:52.960]   You can also read his blog at buzzmachine.com.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.960]   His many books are on Amazon.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.960]   And there is a Kindle single, Gutenberg, the geek.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.960]   There's public parts.
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.960]   And what would Google do?
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:06.960]   Geno Trippani's Biz is ThinkUp, T-H-I-N-K-U-P dot com.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.960]   A great place to get insights into your Facebook and Twitter
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:11.960]   feed.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.960]   What if analytics were for real people, she says?
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.960]   You know, we're actually redoing that landing page, Leo,
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.960]   because it's terrible.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960]   It doesn't really explain what the product is.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.960]   And Team ThinkUp was actually scrambling to get that done by
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.960]   Twig today.
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:26.960]   Don't you?
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.960]   We didn't quite make it.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.960]   How about if I show my ThinkUp analytics?
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.960]   I always like going through this.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:33.960]   You're so fun.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:34.960]   I go to my page.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.960]   This is the kind of stuff I get.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.960]   Congratulations is an order, Leo.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.960]   ThinkUp noticed that you had something very exciting happen?
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.960]   Does it have a little thing?
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:46.960]   Well, your photo changed now.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:47.960]   It just has the change.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.960]   This status update got 10 times the likes.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.960]   464 people liked that.
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.960]   Yeah, that's a good photo right there.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:55.960]   Still working on that.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:56.960]   We will show that.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:59.960]   Beta, beta, beta.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.960]   We're still a beta.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.960]   It shows you your tweets and what people like.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.960]   Actually, this is a tweet I might want to mention at some point.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.960]   I've been having, remember I talked about how Oyster Books was
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.960]   suddenly billing me monthly on my Google Wallet?
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.960]   So I got on the chat with the Google Wallet tech support and
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.960]   they said, "Well, I can't do anything."
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:22.960]   You better contact Oyster.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:23.960]   Really?
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:24.960]   Yeah, well, they said you contact Oyster.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:25.960]   So I contacted Oyster.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.960]   They said, "No, we don't know anything about it.
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:30.960]   We don't use Google Wallet."
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.960]   I said, "Well, what am I supposed to do?"
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.960]   So they said, "Your Oyster Books solution was sign up for an account on Oyster Books
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:41.960]   and then cancel it."
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:42.960]   So they started canceled.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:45.960]   And then we'll see, and we'll see, because they use Stripe I guess,
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:46.960]   so they don't see any.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.960]   Meanwhile, every month I get charged 10 bucks.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:56.960]   So my point, I guess, is the Google Wallet is not a credit card.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.960]   There is a credit card associated with it, but it's not a credit card.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:02.960]   If it were, I could just say, "Well, stop it."
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.960]   And they would have to stop it, right?
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.960]   But Google Wallet says, "Well, nothing we can do about it."
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.960]   Yeah, that's a bummer.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.960]   That's a bummer.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.960]   So I am going to call the MasterCard associated with my Google Wallet
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.960]   and say, "Can you stop it?"
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.960]   But if you didn't use a MasterCard, you'd...
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.960]   And the problem is my Google Wallet is tied to Google Music
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.960]   and my app purchases, so I can't just get rid of my Google Wallet
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:28.960]   or not fund it.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:29.960]   Right.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:30.960]   Right.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.960]   If you can not fund your wallet, then it won't...
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.960]   But then I won't.
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:35.960]   I'll lose other things.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.960]   It's crazy how hard...
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.960]   Like, credit cards are so hard.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960]   We have so many credit card failures.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.960]   It's still so hard to manage this kind of thing.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:46.960]   Like, even with great tools, like Stripe, Amazon Payments, and Google Wallet,
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.960]   like, you still running these weird situations where it's like,
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.960]   "What is going on?"
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:51.960]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:52.960]   It's fine.
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:53.960]   It's 10 bucks a month.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:54.960]   It's not killing me.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.960]   But at the same time, it's something people should understand.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:58.960]   It's the time.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.960]   It's the irritation.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:00.960]   No, no, it's fine.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:01.960]   It's not even that.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:02.960]   I don't care.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.960]   I let it go for three months before I even kind of made any effort.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:06.960]   10 bucks.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:11.960]   But you should understand that you are vulnerable if you're using Google Wallet.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.960]   It's nearly like it's like it's like...
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.960]   They can literally throw up their hands and say, "Yeah, contact the company.
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:18.960]   What if it's fraudulent?
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.960]   What if it's not a real company?"
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:22.960]   Yeah, that's a thing.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:23.960]   That's not right.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.960]   I was shocked.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.960]   When the rep from Google Wallet said, "Yeah, no, we can't do anything about it.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.960]   No, that policy might be changing."
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:32.960]   It's shocking.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:38.960]   But I guess because bank, the way banking regulations work, it's not a credit card.
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.960]   It's a debit account.
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.960]   It's not protected.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.960]   Oh, back to ThinkUp.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.960]   I love ThinkUp.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.960]   And our front page is actually going to explain what we do a little bit more.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.960]   That'll probably be up tomorrow.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.960]   The best way is to really look at somebody's analytics and see all the things you learn.
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.960]   I mean, I tweeted 20 times last week and I can see what my number one tweet was.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:04.960]   I mean, it's just really great.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:05.960]   Who follows me?
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.960]   What verified users follow me?
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:12.960]   And my favorite one is, you know, your retweet garnered somebody half a million more viewers.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.960]   I like that.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:14.960]   That makes me...
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:15.960]   Powerful.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960]   All right.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:18.960]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.960]   It's been so much fun.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.960]   Gina Trepani, smarterware.org is her blog, which she never posted because she's busy making ThinkUp better.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.960]   ThinkUp.com.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.960]   There is TodoText.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:30.960]   That's great, too.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.960]   That's her great to do list for Android and iOS.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:37.960]   Thanks to Chad Johnson, our producer, who works very hard each week, figuring out what we can talk about.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.960]   And thanks to you for joining us.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.960]   We do twig 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time, 2000 UTC every Wednesday afternoon right here.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.960]   I hope you will stop by and watch live.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.960]   If you can't, though, on-demand audio and video is always available after the fact at twit.tv/twit.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.960]   And on our apps, there are apps for every platform.
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.960]   I say R. I didn't write them.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:02.960]   We don't write them.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.960]   We have wonderful third-party developers who take a lot of time and effort to write those, and we thank them a tip of that to them.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.960]   And of course, on iTunes and everywhere else podcasts are aggregated.
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:10.960]   Thank you for watching.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:13.960]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:23.960]   [Music]
