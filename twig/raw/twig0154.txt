[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.960]   It's this week in Google plus.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.200]   No, that's not right either.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.920]   It's this week in Google and other stuff, the cloud, Facebook,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.120]   you know, that kind of thing.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Gina Trepenny of smartaward.org.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.680]   So happy to be here.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.760]   To be back after the July 4th holiday.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.520]   Can we talk about the Nexus 7?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.240]   We'll talk about it.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   Is that what you have right there in your hot little hand?
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.740]   Yes.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.160]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.200]   We'll talk about it.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.760]   I'm excited.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.360]   You're making--
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.960]   I just talked about it last week.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   You're making Jeff Jarvis jealous?
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.600]   Very, very jealous.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   From Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.320]   I agree.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960]   I am so happy to be back.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   My friends, two weeks without twig,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   is like a half a month without sunshine.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.560]   Wow, I feel good.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960]   It was an eternity.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.840]   That's great.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.640]   Look, who else is here?
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   And guess what he brought?
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.880]   Jeremiah O. Yang is here.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.840]   You guys, that's the next--
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.120]   And list from webstrategist.com.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.520]   I brought my Google Glass.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.080]   We'll talk about that.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.480]   Oh, I'm 747.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.460]   I got you, dude.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.100]   And I brought the Google Pokemon ball.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.300]   And the Chrome box, the Chromebook.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.940]   And it looks like you might have a Nexus 7 somewhere
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.540]   in that stack of tablets over there.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.420]   We got a couple toys.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.460]   So this is good.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.780]   We will talk a little bit about the hardware from Google I/O,
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.700]   which we kind of did a quick review on before you buy.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.540]   We were really on this show.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.980]   We haven't had a chance to talk about it at all.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700]   Quick promo later today, 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern,
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.180]   Time 2,200 UTC.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.380]   Nolan Bushnell will be our guest on triangulation,
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.300]   the man who created Atari and Chuckie Cheesepheats
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.060]   at Time Theater.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.060]   I guess we should start with the stuff, the swag pile.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.180]   I did a little calculation.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.860]   $1,125 worth of stuff at Google I/O. It included.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.100]   But well, it's a net loss, though, if you bought the glasses.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.180]   So it included a Google Nexus phone.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.860]   That's nice.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.620]   Do you have your Nexus?
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.700]   No, I didn't bring that.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.420]   We've seen it.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.140]   It came out November.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.580]   And Nexus 7 tablet.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.100]   Yep.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.420]   Got that right there.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.900]   It included a Q, $300 Q, and the Orb.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.820]   Or a Batchy Ball, whatever you'd like to do with it.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.620]   It's heavy.
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.620]   It's very heavy.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.500]   And a Samsung Chrome box, which is, of course, basically
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.540]   a Mac mini, but it runs Chrome OS.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.460]   So that's $1,125 worth of stuff.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.940]   But then, if you queued up, as apparently you did,
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.820]   to buy the Google glasses, which will be delivered next year,
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.020]   you get this--
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.580]   a solid piece of glass.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.180]   When there's number--
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.980]   There's no way you're in it.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.940]   That's it.
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.980]   Where's mine?
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.180]   Where did we put it?
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.060]   What was Scobles' number?
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.180]   He did tweet it.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.180]   It was sub 200, something like that.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.700]   Of course.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.940]   You had to get in line, right, Gina, to get it?
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.460]   You did it.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.980]   In fact, I didn't even get one of those.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.900]   I didn't even get a number.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.220]   I was so late that it was kind of like the last day.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.820]   And I kind of go back and forth about a quarter order.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.820]   But you did put down 1,500 bucks.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.460]   Yes, I did.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.500]   I preordered.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.000]   I did.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.700]   Now, we don't have to pay until they actually deliver these.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.200]   Right.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.460]   But I didn't get one of those.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.780]   737.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.460]   So this is the new Geek status symbol, isn't it, Jeremiah?
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.980]   What's your number?
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.820]   What are you trying to say?
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.780]   What are you trying to say there?
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.340]   I just want to say, I'm a 200-bit in you.
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.980]   Forget cloud.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.820]   What's your glass number?
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.340]   What's your glass number?
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.820]   Forget your cloud number.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.620]   What's your glass number?
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.580]   So actually, this really is the full index.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.220]   Because $1,500, that's a lot for product.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.220]   Right.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.220]   What do you think is one of the products?
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.220]   What do you think is one of the products?
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.540]   It indicates how fast you ran to spend 1,500 bucks
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.380]   on a prototype.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.380]   What a sucker we are.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.460]   The lower the number, the bigger the sucker.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.820]   You know what?
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.340]   Surprisingly, I haven't seen any Google Glass on eBay yet.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.460]   Are you watching every week to see who's going to put it up?
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.220]   I guess you could sell your number, huh?
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.260]   You could probably sell the product.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.860]   You bought it, right?
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.260]   I didn't mean the terms of service that curve.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.580]   I haven't seen the terms of service.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.460]   But the point is, we do want to be able to review it
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.460]   for this week in Google.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.780]   I'm sure you never review it.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.620]   Someone asked how I justified it to my wife.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.780]   This is a part of my job.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.620]   And Gina and I are going to conspire about that later.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.620]   Yes, we are.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.620]   I'm going to live vicariously with Regina
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.860]   and use my foundation money to do it.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.980]   I love it.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.500]   Yeah, I got connections.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.140]   So I love this because Jeremiah is wearing a Google Buzz
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.060]   shirt.
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.980]   Was Buzz killed?
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.980]   Who killed the Buzz?
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.980]   Who killed the Buzz?
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.700]   Did Buzz get-- if I go to Buzz.google--
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.300]   Pretty sure it has been retired probably over a year
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.380]   before Google plus--
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.380]   Oh, look, I'm getting an answer.py script.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.500]   A sure sign that something's dead.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.260]   So Buzz has been replaced by Plus.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.020]   iGoogle is going away.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.180]   That kind of surprised me.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.340]   But I guess nobody does.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.340]   I never liked it much.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.820]   I used it.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.380]   It was so Yahoo-y.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.380]   Well, it was a portal, right?
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.780]   It was a portal.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.940]   It's a poor man's feed reader, right?
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.100]   It's an easy feed reader.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.220]   Not at all.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.300]   So here's my iGoogle page.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.260]   You can put these little widgets on here.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.100]   I've got the weather.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.020]   I've got my Google Calendar, a little Wolf from Alpha Search.
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.860]   I've got stock markets.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.820]   I've got maps.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.740]   And yes, here's the reader part.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.540]   But also, I loved this, the how-to of the day.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.660]   So these are all little modules that you could put in here.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.580]   It should have been an Android page on the web.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.060]   Well, this is what--
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.460]   Technology is very 2007.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.660]   It's my Yahoo.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.580]   It's what my Yahoo was.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.900]   Yes, it was my Yahoo, exactly.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.020]   But that's six life hacker readers love Google.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.460]   They love it.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.620]   There was another one, NetVibes.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.420]   That was really popular.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.460]   Love NetVibes.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.180]   Is that still around?
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.860]   But people just don't insert the web this way anymore.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.300]   It's because we've changed now.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.580]   We don't look at these--
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.420]   what do you call it?
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.980]   We consume things through feeds.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.420]   No, that's the problem.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.700]   You're calling it a smorgasbord.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.940]   I call it a dashboard.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.540]   That's hip.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.060]   Dashboard is hip.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.940]   Smorgasbord is like Perry's smorgy.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.980]   999, all you can eat.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.860]   I know we'll get to this later, but I was really, really
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.660]   struck by the iPad version of Google+
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.260]   and how different it is.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.540]   It's so gorgeous.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.780]   Actually, I'm having people get me things today.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.100]   Could you get me my iPad?
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.540]   Because I do want to show people this.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.980]   This is quite gorgeous.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.140]   So Google shutdowns.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.620]   This is the Larry Page tsunami.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.180]   I Google, Google video.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.300]   I Google, by the way, in November, right?
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.340]   Google video.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.460]   They've been warning me about this for a while saying,
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.100]   you have videos.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.380]   Would you please move them over?
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.620]   What's Google mini?
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.140]   I don't even know what Google mini is.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.220]   Wasn't that the box?
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.620]   Wasn't that the search appliance?
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.460]   Search appliance.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.100]   Oh, there was a search appliance.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.300]   So they have another search appliance.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.940]   So that's not a big deal.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.500]   Presumably you're using the other search appliance, if you're--
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.340]   But this is all normal in a company that's constantly
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.300]   innovating and changing things.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.380]   They try things out in the 20% to 30% of the R&D time.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.940]   They shut them down if it doesn't work.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.420]   I think that's actually a brilliant model,
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.940]   rather than forcing it.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.340]   But I get these cool shirts.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.060]   They're on the third iteration of social now, right?
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.060]   And it makes that shirt so much more valuable than it's--
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.740]   You want to buy it?
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.060]   Yes.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.180]   We're just going to move on.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.180]   A shirt.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:37.980]   You've never seen.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.420]   I don't know.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.700]   I probably got it at one of the--
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.020]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.220]   If I gave you my number for your number, my lower number,
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.260]   would you give me that shirt?
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.500]   Not on air.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.540]   You're not wearing anything underneath.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.460]   I'm not giving you my tech TV shirt
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.660]   because that's even more obsolete.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.700]   Yeah, I agree, Jeremiah.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.500]   You shut things down.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.340]   We do it here.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.900]   We cancel shows after a while, and we bring in new shows.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.940]   That's just part of-- it's called--
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.380]   it's being a good gardener.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.220]   So what are which one of these hardware devices
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.980]   you're going to get shut down here?
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.980]   OK.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.140]   Take a-- OK, let's go to-- OK, Gina.
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.980]   We've got a Chrome box, but let's talk-- let's say Chrome OS.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.820]   We've got a Google Q. We've got Google Glass.
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.540]   We've got a Nexus 7, and we've got a Galaxy Nexus phone, which
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.300]   will be the first to die.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.620]   The first to die relative to its launch
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.060]   because glass isn't going to be out for a while.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.900]   Is that what we're saying?
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.780]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.260]   Well, you could leave Glass out.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.620]   Well, the Q.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.900]   Yeah, pretty obvious, right?
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.420]   Any dissension here?
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.180]   No.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.420]   That's definitely going away.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.380]   I think it already went away.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.820]   I don't even think it was still born.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.500]   Can you buy it now?
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.420]   Yes, play.google.com.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.900]   I have a very single person to say, oh, I got my Q.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.140]   No.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.340]   I wonder if we actually made this.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.620]   Let's see if we can find a real person.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.740]   It's made in the USA.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.940]   That was one-- it's one recommending point.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.420]   Here's what's wrong with it.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.020]   If it were $99 or $89, I don't think we'd be disparaging it,
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.780]   right?
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.620]   It's $300 is the problem.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.100]   Yeah, the price tag is the problem.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.300]   It seems like the Q is more of a proof of concept
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.660]   of the Android at home stuff than an actual product
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.860]   they expected people to buy for multiple rooms of their house.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.940]   And you know what I'm going to say?
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.500]   The Q, it's cool.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.260]   I liked it.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.100]   I like playing around with it.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.140]   Well, it's pretty.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:26.660]   I bought it.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.660]   It's pretty.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.220]   It's interesting.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.580]   I like sending songs to it.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.900]   I had a couple of friends over with Android phones.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.220]   We were sending YouTube videos to it, which is something
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:36.940]   we normally do.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.900]   We generally pass around the tablet.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.100]   Kind of cool to do on TV.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.660]   But it's way too expensive and way too limited.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.940]   And you're assuming you like your friend's music?
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.980]   Well, it's kind of annoying because your friend could actually
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.820]   take over the playlist, right?
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.940]   You could have a music fight.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.500]   Yeah, he does never go well.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.340]   Especially in checking cheese.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.620]   That's definitely a way to lose friends.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.420]   So I'm OK.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.460]   I have a hypothesis here because I'm on the site.
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.540]   Ships soon.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.860]   This is play.google.com.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.780]   There's ships in one to two weeks.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.340]   And you can order up to two of them.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.420]   Now, remember, the idea of this is if you really want to use it,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.900]   you need one for every room, right?
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.980]   Because it's distributed.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   So the fact that you can only order two tells me they didn't
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.740]   make very many.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.100]   And that tells me that they're never
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.540]   going to make any more.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:33.860]   So it's, I think, from that, I deduce this is already dead.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.820]   Yep, I agree.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.700]   I mean, Google's--
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.540]   Look at this shotgun spread of products they launched.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.140]   I mean, that is the Google model.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.700]   Shotgun spread.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.380]   Shotgun.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.020]   Shotgun.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.140]   But Jeremiah, you just said kind of it was.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.660]   It's changed.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.140]   That was the model.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.740]   But then Larry has been trying to focus the company with a
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.300]   laser.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.100]   And this is an odd one.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.140]   Two lasers.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.100]   But it doesn't show the kind of focus that I think that he
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.340]   has wanted to bring, unless they said we're going to have a
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.900]   whole panoply of products.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.500]   Now, the other way around it is that--
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.180]   I can't wait.
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.220]   We talked about the seven.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.300]   But it's fascinating that no one made a decent Android
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.380]   tablet until Google made one.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.220]   And maybe with Motorola and all that, they have to be in
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.940]   the business of making demonstration products.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.860]   Microsoft clearly thinks that.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.620]   They're making the surface because nobody is made or
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.860]   shown a Windows RT tablet that's in the least big
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.180]   compelling.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.580]   But I don't know where the big business is.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.100]   Then Gene is right, I think.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.020]   What they're trying to do is do demonstration of what's
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.940]   possible.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.140]   It's a reference platform.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.580]   Well, this isn't a reference platform because they don't
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.500]   want other people to make anything like this.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.180]   But they want them to make Android-based media
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.700]   decisions.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:43.980]   Appliances.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.460]   They're just trying to figure out how do we get the
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.860]   Google experience in front of the audio-visual setup in
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.020]   your living room.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.820]   But ironically, that doesn't even do this.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.260]   This doesn't even do that.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.940]   You have to have an Android device to use this.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.060]   If I have a GAM Samsung Galaxy S3 with DLNA, I don't
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.780]   even need this.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.700]   I could do everything that the Q does with my phone, right?
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.900]   To my TV, I don't need this thing.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.700]   The only thing this offers that my Samsung Galaxy S does not
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.300]   is a 25-watt amplifier.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.220]   That's a little pricey.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.540]   That's the best speakers of the house.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.060]   This just seemed like an Android.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.340]   Last year, Google I/O, they announced Android at home.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.780]   The idea of having appliances with Android built in that
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.420]   can do--
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.100]   Did it look like this, though?
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.180]   Remember when they waved a CD over something?
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.980]   And it looked kind of like this.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.300]   Yeah, it did.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.380]   Oh, that's right.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.180]   It was called--
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.820]   That's right.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.900]   --the device-- Android-powered device hub called Tungsten.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.940]   This might be Tungsten.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.820]   Yes, RFID embedded into CD cases.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.340]   The device was able to detect the CD and add it to your
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.900]   library, right?
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.380]   So you would wave the CD over the device.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.660]   So I think that this is-- it seems like the Nexus Q is
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.980]   just Google's way of saying, like, here's one--
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.980]   Here's a way you could do it.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.980]   --of Android at home.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.660]   I think that's right.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.180]   It's cool.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.900]   It's got 29 LEDs in it right.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.860]   It looks very pretty.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.300]   It's hot spins.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.740]   And that's the volume control, which I really like.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.420]   It's cool.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.300]   While you're listening to something, you can tap your--
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.620]   you can touch it--
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.580]   or not even really tap it.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.980]   You just touch it to pause.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.060]   So it's neat.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.500]   It's not anything I would have ever spent 300 bucks on.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.580]   It's a conversation piece in front of your TV.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.660]   And then it becomes a door stop.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.460]   On the rundown, I put up something--
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.780]   and since you guys were at iOS and I wasn't,
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.540]   there was the Android device kit.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.540]   Have you seen this thing?
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.660]   It looks like an odd phone.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.460]   Android device kit.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.220]   The last link under Android.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.660]   Android accessory development kit.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.860]   I thought this was something that they did at iOS.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.580]   It's really kind of neat.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.940]   It's a device that has tons of sensors in it.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.660]   Ooh.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.580]   And this I want.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.020]   Try to get people to think about using Android
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.340]   with more kinds of devices.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.820]   So they announced this at Google I/O.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.100]   I didn't hear anything about it.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.660]   The ADK.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.100]   No, that was an in-app.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.460]   I'm pretty sure that was not--
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.340]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.660]   An update to the ADK they announced at Google I/O.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.420]   It's a comes out of the-- I want this.
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.100]   This I would get.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.220]   Why didn't they offer this?
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.420]   It's a lot of it.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.060]   It has all these sensors on it and stuff.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.100]   It has a working alarm clock and audio
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.300]   to dock its compatible with your Android devices.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.140]   I get so much that, right?
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.020]   How do I get this?
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.220]   I wasn't at this session.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.060]   How do I get this?
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.060]   This is interesting because what this does
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.660]   is say it tries to get people to think about new ways
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   to use Android, new ways to connect the notion of all the--
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.420]   I think that the sensor world is going to be the next--
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.100]   I agree.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.980]   --back you fad for a few months, right?
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.980]   But we'll have fun with that.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.780]   And so it has--
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.180]   see, it can't hack or something.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.820]   It's some possible uses of the kit.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.660]   It's archieino.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.740]   It's based on archieino.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.460]   Pico satellite, home room, hotel room alarm, irrigation
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.740]   controller, motorized remote control, drapes, smart thermostat,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.700]   egg timer with atmospheric pressure compensating.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.460]   That's awesome.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.140]   Data, weather, weather, and weather station.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.140]   Did I mention robots?
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.060]   It's really fun to see what people build.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.100]   Now, this is something for development.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.860]   And there were a lot of robots at I/O this year.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.620]   And drones.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.860]   And you've seen the $99 Kickstarter project
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.100]   for an Android gaming device.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.660]   Right.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.700]   In fact, I should check how that status of that
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.940]   is because they launched a couple of days ago,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.780]   and they'd already raised something like $100,000
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.460]   in the first couple of days.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.380]   What is the name of that?
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.060]   It's like the oh, who know or something?
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.820]   Anybody got a name?
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.340]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:48.820]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.500]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.820]   I think is in the chat.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.860]   Is it a new kind of video game console?
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.820]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.500]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.540]   How much have they raised?
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.180]   They won $950,000.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   They've got $3.3 million.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.860]   Wow.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.500]   In two days.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.620]   And it's open.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.260]   It's open.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.620]   It's Android.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.020]   Which is what the orb should be,
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.820]   which is what Google TV should be.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.420]   Well, Google's got to be happy about this.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.300]   This is exactly what they're talking about.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.420]   Why isn't Google putting out--
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.340]   I mean, yes.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.220]   This is exactly what they want.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.540]   I think because Google doesn't want to.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.780]   They want people to do this.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:26.740]   They've got 22,228 backers who pledged $100 to get one.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.380]   100 bucks is nothing.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:28.700]   I know.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.460]   I should have done this.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.820]   They're sold out of half these packages.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.060]   Did you get a pebble, too?
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.500]   Did you order that?
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.420]   I ordered a pebble.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.260]   That's Android.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.420]   This is amazing.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.540]   $3.3 million.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.940]   Yeah, pebbles, Android, although they're
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.020]   going to make it work with iOS as well.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.820]   That's intriguing.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.060]   I don't know what that means.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.660]   So this is very similar to this.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.460]   I want to say this open accessory protocol.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.340]   Where do I get the kit?
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.060]   You know Leo?
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.220]   That's what I forget that.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.020]   I'll trade you a queue for an ADK.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.940]   I think-- let me just go on a limb here.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:10.940]   I think that the Twit network should have a contest for creating--
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.740]   forget these hackathons and stuff--
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   for creating products and things around that kit.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.300]   Oh.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.540]   Oh.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.140]   With the-- with the prize?
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.980]   With the prize.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.700]   All right, deal.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.700]   The prize is recognition from Leo the King.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.620]   No.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.580]   Are you willing to serve as judges?
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.220]   Absolutely.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.580]   Absolutely.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.180]   All right.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.260]   I got a panel of four judges.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:29.740]   Sure.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.260]   Let me put together a prize fund.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.700]   We should have a prize fund, right?
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:33.900]   We don't need to do much.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.380]   I don't think I think--
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:34.860]   $1,000.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.020]   $4 is enough.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.500]   $1,000 from Jeff.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.220]   $1,000 from the prize.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.860]   You need to come on Twit and demo you.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.180]   You need to demo it.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.460]   Oh, I know what the prize is.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.380]   Jeremiah's a queue.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.340]   And Leo's glass.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.940]   No, I'm not giving you my glass.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.460]   How about if we give you your very own exos queue?
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.620]   That's just mean.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.380]   And then a wave t-shirt to the runner up.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:57.900]   It's a deal.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.860]   We're going to figure that out.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.980]   We'll do it like Shark Tank, where you get to come on
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.780]   and you present.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:10.300]   And the four judges will do special edition of Twig with that.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.140]   It's a developer.android.com/tools/adk.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.660]   Yes, but I don't see the hardware.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.180]   There is no link to get the hardware that I can see.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.420]   That's what I want.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:20.860]   That's--
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.740]   No, I know.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.540]   Maybe I could just-- I'm supposed to build that thing?
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.540]   No.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.380]   I'm not that good.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.540]   I'm not a hardware hacker.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.500]   I'm a software hacker.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.860]   I want the hardware so I can hack it.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.740]   It's based on our jouino, which is kind of cool.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.780]   I'll figure it out.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.940]   I'm going to get one of those.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.220]   So what are we proposing, Jeff, that--
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.180]   I'm not sure.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.900]   Does it need to be a working prototype?
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.340]   Yes.
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.100]   You got to see something.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.300]   Yeah, it just can't be powered by--
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.220]   Or do you want to do--
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.140]   If it's just a board, it doesn't be pretty.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.460]   It's showing a concept of a new way
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.660]   to think about using Android as an open platform on--
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.420]   Well, and now thanks to the chat room who
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.300]   has sent me to adafruit.com, which
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.020]   is a really great site for this kind of stuff.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.380]   And they have a variety of ADK development boards.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.060]   Oh.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.340]   Oh, yeah, that's true.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.020]   This is for $76 as an example.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.580]   It's the Arduino Mega Android accessory development kit.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.460]   It's just a little board.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.020]   It's got a USB connector on it.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.020]   It's $75.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.300]   It's $54 digital I/O pins, 14 of which
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.460]   can be used as PWM output, 16 analog inputs.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.900]   For UR to 16 megahertz crystal oscillator, power
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.340]   and ISCSP header and a reset button.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.380]   Wow.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.620]   And then there's a Raspberry Pi.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.100]   I mean, there's a lot-- this is an exciting arena.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.060]   If I were a young person--
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.900]   But you are.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.340]   So Gina, you miss my software development queen.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.420]   Yes.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.380]   Yes.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.940]   Have you often wanted to make hardware?
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.300]   You want to work with it.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.460]   Well, you ordered your last and all that.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.460]   But have you ever dreamed of making hardware stuff?
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.420]   I've never-- I've been more of a software person than hardware.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.820]   I mean, I really appreciate hardware hacking.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.060]   I appreciate the gadgets that have great design.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.020]   But I've never been a huge gadget person.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.180]   I've always wanted to make software.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.700]   And especially with touch screens,
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   where the software really kind of renders the interface.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.860]   That was super exciting to me.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.860]   So yeah.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.620]   And I think that would block.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.140]   With software APIs, I can imagine things.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.660]   And I can see different apps and things.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.140]   Still limitation.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.640]   Right.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.260]   With hardware, I think maybe it's just because I'm not
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.700]   as just familiar with the landscape.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.140]   I have a harder time imagining what's possible.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.620]   And something like, well, if every CD in your collection
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.220]   has an RFID chip, then it's like, what?
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.380]   That's the kind of thing that would shut me down.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.500]   But I think it's the kind of thing where you really
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.380]   have to imagine a future where everybody has
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.540]   these things where things are enabled, RFID or NFC
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:09.900]   enabled.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.220]   And I think it's really kind of a bet toward the future.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.660]   Even the queue, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.780]   I don't think the Nexus Q app runs on anything higher
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.860]   than Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.340]   No, that's not true.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.420]   According to the website, it's gingerbread or better.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.500]   Oh, it's gingerbread or better.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.300]   OK, OK, that's good.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.540]   But it's one of those things that you really have
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.540]   to look toward the future.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.900]   And I'm just like, I don't know, maybe it's my ego.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.940]   I need to make stuff that people can use now,
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.340]   that people can deploy out to their browsers or their phones.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.740]   I think I got spoiled by web development.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.020]   You put it out and it works.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.380]   Gina, I have a question for you.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.180]   But with Google last coming, it's
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.180]   like devices are on our bodies all the time.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.140]   You have to factor in that form function.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.020]   I mean, you're a developer.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.220]   How are you going to adjust to that?
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:46.980]   What do you think?
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.140]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.540]   a similar thing to when smartphones became a lot more
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.060]   ubiquitous.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.900]   I never thought that I would make
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.100]   native mobile web apps or apps.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.420]   I always thought I would just make web apps.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.020]   But when it became that I had the smartphone in my pocket
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.660]   all the time, and it was a device that I love,
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.060]   I'm very much a kind of scratch-your-own-itch kind of developer,
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.220]   if I want something.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.180]   So if I get the glasses and I love them
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.460]   and I'm dying to see something in my heads-up display
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.060]   that hasn't been built yet, I'll build it.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.900]   That's what's so great about software.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.900]   And I'm with Eugene.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.700]   A software is infinitely malleable.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.860]   It's cool to be a hardware hacker and you need them.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.180]   But I agree that these chips and this wearable technology
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.180]   is going to be everywhere.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.580]   It's going to be a lot more ubiquitous.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.460]   Just the way that I never dreamed that we would have computers
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.060]   in our pockets the way that we do now.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.620]   The only downside about the software
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.900]   is that you are dependent upon whatever platform
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.060]   you're going to build on.
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.700]   Absolutely.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.980]   And we've been hearing that happen a lot with Facebook,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.940]   Twitter, and you know what Alan Kay said.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.980]   If you really care about software, you have to do hardware.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.820]   I mean, so--
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.460]   But that's not an individual.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.820]   Yeah, that's not an individual.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.540]   Is there a Raspberry Pi-- is the thing you showed?
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.620]   Is there a Raspberry Pi for Android?
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.060]   Is that what you showed that are?
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.660]   Do we know a thing?
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.980]   No, that's not a Raspberry Pi.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.660]   Raspberry Pi is a $30 Linux box, basically.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.460]   Is there an equivalent for Android?
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.020]   Let me just check if you can run the ADK.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.940]   It's a simple little card that will run the Android operating
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.780]   system that you can just plug into.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.900]   I would bet that you could put the ADK on Raspberry Pi.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.660]   It's a GNU Linux box.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.020]   But I would bet-- and see, that's what's interesting.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.460]   And from a Google's point of view,
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.460]   of course, Google is ultimately not a hardware house either.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.460]   Right, for sure.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.780]   But they want to facilitate hardware development.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.180]   And that's why the ADK is so smart.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.460]   And if you're somebody like Gina,
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.460]   or you're interested in technology,
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.940]   that would be a very good skill, I think, going forward
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.860]   to know that.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.780]   So let's talk about--
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.100]   To have a team, right?
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.300]   I mean, in my world, I have content people who obviously
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.620]   have to be tied with technology people.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.820]   You almost wonder if you see more labs popping up
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.940]   with software and hardware people together.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.260]   Right.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.900]   And we're seeing the growth of hardware devices emerging
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.700]   on Kickstarter.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.700]   So people are--
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.220]   Exactly.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.940]   --and that traditionally we've seen the web startups
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.060]   and before that media.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.660]   But let's talk about Google and why all this hardware push.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.980]   So my whole thesis, I want to hear from you guys,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.500]   is that it's just about getting Google experience everywhere
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.180]   in the world.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.100]   And this is why it's a shotgun approach.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.820]   They're going to put the hardware everywhere
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.500]   so they can capture the world.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.220]   And let me translate, capture the world
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.500]   means organizing the world's information
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.660]   so you can sell ads against it.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.300]   That's really all about what this is.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.620]   Google experience everywhere.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.700]   Monetize it.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.820]   What do you think?
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.500]   Absolutely.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:38.860]   No doubt.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.220]   I'm sorry, I'm busy ordering 80K.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.780]   Here's the I/O/I/O.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.260]   The Mint.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.580]   It goes in a little Mint box.
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:50.900]   Portable Android.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.900]   Yeah, that thing is cool.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.820]   Anything in a Mint box.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:52.820]   Wow.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.340]   It is cool.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.660]   But you said that you thought that they didn't emphasize
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.260]   the Google+ announcements as much, kind of for this reason.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.300]   Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.900]   You remember about a year ago?
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.220]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.020]   Let's not talk about it.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.900]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.860]   Then when we come back--
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.500]   All right.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   --we talked about hardware.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.860]   Let's talk about Google+.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.020]   Why it wasn't more of Google I/O.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.180]   But, we got a great panel, by the way.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.460]   Jeremiah O. Yang is joining us right now.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.700]   Gina Trapani, of course, from San Diego and Jeff Jarvis
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.820]   from CUNY, and he went home because the network was all
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.260]   borked.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.420]   Good excuse to go home early.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.100]   I was rushing my little bike off.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.620]   Thank you.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:30.140]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.820]   Takes a minimum of an hour and a half to get home.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.700]   Is that on a train?
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.380]   Our 40-- no, it's trains, planes, automobiles.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.300]   I don't know.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.020]   And I know it takes you a minute and a half to get it.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.220]   I love my commute.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.580]   500 steps, I count it.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.540]   H.
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.060]   I H.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.380]   500 steps.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.020]   That's good.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.020]   Well, it could have been better.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.340]   I could have lived in the basement here.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.940]   But they wouldn't let me.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.460]   I don't want to wind those down there.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.780]   Fire Marshall wouldn't let me.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.060]   I got a bean bag.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.940]   I just need a shower.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.060]   I want to invite you to start using your time
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.100]   where effectively spend less time at the post office.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.860]   How about if your commute to the post office were zero steps?
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.940]   What about that, huh?
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.460]   Not just to buy stamps, but to prepare shipping.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.100]   What if you're an eBay seller and Amazon seller?
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.660]   A big part of your job, right, is getting that package ready
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.580]   for shipping, getting the right postage, filling out
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.460]   the forms, all of that.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.100]   Stamps.com, baby.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.500]   This is the way to do it.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.300]   If you're a small business, if you do any amount of shipping--
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.420]   actually, I know a lot of home users really like stamps.com.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.220]   Just because you don't have to buy postage anymore,
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   you print your own postage from your computer
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.740]   and your printer.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.460]   You could print it right on the envelope.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.740]   You can have your own logo.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.100]   It really looks professional.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.820]   It looks sweet.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.380]   You could print on packages.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.740]   You could, if you want little stickies,
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.820]   you could print sticky stamps, too.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.980]   It's all from stamps.com.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.020]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.020]   You don't need special ink.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.180]   You just need stamps.com.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.380]   Now, here's the deal.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.500]   Actually, is that the video there we're going to show?
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.140]   We can show the video real quickly.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.220]   This is a happystamps.com user.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.820]   So the idea is actual customers talking
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.780]   about actual stamps.com.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.060]   Really, the cool thing is the post office loves you.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.220]   They love stamps.com so much.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.420]   It's not like over-their-dead body kind of thing.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.100]   They love it.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.500]   They give you discounts you cannot get at the post office
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.620]   on Express and Priority Mail.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.540]   If you're doing international postage, which is usually a pain,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.220]   not only can it print international postage,
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.260]   it will fill out the forms for you.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.260]   Same thing with Amazon and eBay sellers.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.420]   It'll take the data right from the website.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.620]   Now, here's a special no risk trial offer.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.940]   Click that go to stamps.com.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.020]   Click that radio microphone.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.500]   They got one of those classical microphones
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.460]   in the upper right hand corner.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.740]   It's the offer code TWIG.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.660]   That way we get Jeff and G to get credit.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.540]   TWIG.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.420]   Now, suddenly, the $80 no risk trial is $110.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.340]   You get $55 in postage coupons.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.980]   You can use over a few month period.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.300]   You get a free digital scale.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.980]   You just pay shipping and handling for the scale is $5.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.740]   You get a supply kit and a month free trial, $110 offer.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.540]   But only when you use the offer code TWIG.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.860]   Go to stamps.com right now.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.820]   Try it out.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.500]   I tell you, you're going to really like this.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.860]   By the way, you don't even have to go to the post office
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.420]   to mail stuff.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.860]   Even if it's over 13 ounces, you know, post 9/11,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.500]   they have a rule that if it's a package over 13 ounces,
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.660]   you have to bring it in for inspection to the post office.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.460]   Not when you use stamps.com.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.660]   The mail carrier comes, takes it, takes it to the post office.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.660]   You can either have your regularly scheduled pickup
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.980]   or you can schedule a free pickup post office.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.340]   I'm telling you, they love this.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.340]   It lets them close down branches.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.660]   It lets them eliminate clerks because people just do it
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.140]   themselves.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.700]   It's just like the internet.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.100]   Stamps.com.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.580]   Try it today.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.860]   Don't forget to use the offer code TWIG.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.060]   We thank you in advance.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:59.940]   So Google I/O, you were there.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:05.260]   Gina and Jeremiah was there, brought some tools back.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.700]   They, you know, Vic got on stage.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.420]   Was interrupted by Larry, but he got on stage.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.380]   He talked about Google+, right?
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.500]   They showed a nice video of happy people.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.340]   I really think that the focus at Google has changed.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.860]   About a year ago, Leo, they said, everything's
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.020]   focused around Google+, we want to be a social company.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.860]   They're even putting their bonus structure around that.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.620]   You get, you saw the focus at I/O.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.260]   They talked about it a very little, very small amount.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.540]   People were expecting a platform, an API.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:33.980]   Right.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.540]   There wasn't a lot actually available for people.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.140]   There was a very few announcements.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.140]   I thought the history API was kind of cool.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.220]   Gina and I were talking about that.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.660]   But that's just a way to get content into Google+,
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.820]   so when people arrive and their real friends aren't there,
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.940]   that it looks populated.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.420]   That's not really Google content.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.380]   That's kind of--
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.140]   I think it's too soon to argue that there's a shift,
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.820]   just because what they showed at one conference.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.220]   I think it's-- they're not that fickle.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.820]   This is important to their strategy.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.300]   It's about more than just a few things.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.860]   They haven't figured out how to do an API and not
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.380]   ruin Google+, it goes back to what I've
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.940]   said on the show before about the problem with email.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.140]   When it becomes sender controlled, it gets ruined.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.220]   If Google+ gets spammed with my Twitter feed--
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.540]   That's what happened to Buzz.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.940]   Because Buzz did.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.980]   I don't think they have figured out how to do an API,
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.580]   not technologically, but structurally, socially,
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.500]   architecturally.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.660]   And I think that's the issue.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.420]   Yeah, I want one too, but I also don't want Google+ ruin,
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.940]   because I do kind of enjoy the place.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.900]   Well, I absolutely use it too, Jeff.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.700]   But when you look, the focus and the intention
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.460]   was on Google Glass.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.380]   And this is a smart move, because you look at all these
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.260]   products around the table and Google+, these are copies
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.100]   and replicants of other products.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.300]   Do you agree?
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.540]   They're trying to catch up.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.660]   Finally, with Google Glass, they can get into a new market,
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.460]   a new type of product, and attract people like Gina
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.620]   to develop on top of it.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.060]   It's a new--
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.860]   Well, I would argue that it's not--
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.300]   Google Glass is not a product.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.500]   Google Glass is like Siri and like Google's version.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.460]   It is the next step past a surface, past a device.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.180]   And so it's a new way to expand the use of the net
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.300]   beyond having to touch a device to do it.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.020]   And that's a concept.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.140]   And they're pushing that as a big strategic oath.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.340]   But among the things you're going to do is search and use
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.660]   Google+ and other things too.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.100]   I just don't think--
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.380]   I wouldn't read too much into what they put on the agenda,
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.140]   especially considering how much they paid for that stunt
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.620]   around Google Glass.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.420]   But didn't they also say there is no-- who was it?
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.460]   It was Larry who said there is no Google+,
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.420]   there's just Google.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.220]   Exactly.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:39.700]   Exactly.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.940]   And so that could be confirming what Jeremiah's saying,
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.300]   which is, well, let's pay so much attention
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.460]   to the man buying the curtain.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.140]   Or it could be saying, look, we have a large--
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.860]   we're playing a much larger, broader game than just the Google
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.420]  +.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.580]   You're thinking of it like Facebook, like a site that's
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.900]   by itself.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.540]   But really, it's all Google and all those features in Google.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:01.820]   Right.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.820]   Jeremiah, I think you called it the connective tissue of Google.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.180]   Google+ is in your plus post.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.540]   But that's not apparent yet.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.620]   To most of us, it still looks like a separate product,
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.420]   doesn't it?
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.020]   It does.
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.140]   But things are slowly converging, right?
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.300]   I mean, all the things we saw at I/O first
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.820]   did have a big launch.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.220]   Events was a huge Google+ launch.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.780]   No, it was day two.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.500]   And I know that there were some issues we could talk about
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.140]   with the spam issues, the school will freak out.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.340]   But the event was a big launch.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:37.420]   The history API that was in developer preview, that's it.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.820]   That remains to be seen what that will be.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.460]   But I mean, the things that we saw, the last to me,
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.420]   is going to be so--
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.140]   I mean, it's going to be an input into plus.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.820]   Or just into Google, but mostly plus.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.340]   And vice versa.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.940]   So I want to recategorize the piece.
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.140]   Google+, or let me be specifically,
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.340]   the Google profile is part of Google+.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.180]   And it's going to permeate across all Google
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.540]   experiences, including glass, including all these tablets
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.780]   and devices here.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.140]   And they're going to collect the information from your friends
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.580]   and show it on your feed.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.780]   And all of that information will be used to serve up ads
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.020]   in various locations.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.100]   It's just all part of the strategy.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.300]   So Google+ is on.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.820]   It's a horizontal.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.860]   Google+ is a way-- and I've argued this before--
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.540]   and Android are ways for Google.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.780]   And I've said this in the show many times.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.140]   So I apologize if this has occurred.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.460]   But it's a way for them to get us to generate signals
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   about ourselves.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.620]   But they then use, and that that's what makes it inherent
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.620]   into the strategy of the company.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.820]   And so it's not that they're having a social network
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.620]   versus Facebook.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.220]   They have a single generator versus Facebook.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.620]   Or a few.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.140]   Right.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.100]   And all these products have enabled one another.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.740]   Android, it makes glass possible.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:46.940]   Plus makes personalization possible.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.940]   Google now, which they launched in Jelly Bean,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.460]   that I'm convinced that that's basically
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.060]   what's going to be running on glass,
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.780]   because it's aware of where you are and what
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.420]   is most interesting to you.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.980]   And so all these things are just things kind of enabling
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.980]   one another.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.460]   But plus is-- like you said, I think it's the connective tissue.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.900]   I think it's going to be the social part of the people
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.660]   part of Google for going forward.
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.300]   12-side changes.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.060]   It is now, and it's going forward.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.540]   Yeah, I think it's really well said.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:13.820]   Oh, sorry.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.540]   Go ahead.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.300]   No, I mean, I don't know that there's a big shift.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.900]   But I just think it's just part of the reality now.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.780]   We're starting to see the elephant.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.700]   We just-- a bunch of people saw different parts.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.140]   But now we're seeing the full elephant.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.980]   Is that it?
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.460]   Exactly.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.420]   What I want to see is that you know, darn well,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.420]   that there's been a board retreat presentation by Larry
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.940]   Page that says, this is what I think the world's
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.700]   going to look like in three to five years.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.700]   That's the question.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.380]   They need to aim at that target.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.460]   Well, that's what they are doing.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   They need to skate to where the puck is going.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.340]   Where's the elephant?
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:44.660]   Right.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.380]   We're just seeing the parts of the elephant, as you just said,
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.060]   Leo.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.660]   But he's got an elephant in mind.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.740]   And it's being revealed to us bit by bit.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.420]   We'll see what it looks like.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:00.100]   And ultimately, isn't that what is required of Tim Cook,
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.860]   of Mark Zuckerberg, of Larry Page?
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.700]   If you are running a modern technology company,
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.700]   you're looking a few years ahead and saying,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.300]   we think this is where it's going.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.220]   And whoever picks the best wins, right?
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.900]   Absolutely.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.140]   And you do that same thing running this shop.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.060]   You're looking at this.
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.340]   Oh, God.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.180]   I wish somebody told me I was looking for years behind.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.180]   Go!
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180]   Good.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.140]   What went with Leo?
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.380]   Leo, Leo, what would you have done differently?
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.580]   I don't--
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.740]   I'm not that strategic.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.780]   I wish I were that smart.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.340]   These guys are actually smart people.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.980]   I just sit here and go, hey, oh, no.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.860]   Oh, oh, stop with the feeling.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.580]   I'm not being a phony on this.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.100]   I don't feel that I have any idea.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.540]   And when I do, I think every time I try to predict
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.940]   the future with technology, it's like wrong.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.060]   All right, but then go go back.
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.380]   I mean, I love you brought this up.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.020]   Like, that's great.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.940]   Go back for a second.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.100]   I'll torture you for one more minute.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.940]   Well, I was lucky.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.180]   I'm not saying I wasn't lucky a few years ago.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.380]   Right, but if you go back, given the reality we have today,
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.940]   what different decisions would you know what you're doing now?
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.180]   Would you pay three years ago?
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.540]   No, I think we actually-- we've threaded the needle pretty well.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.180]   But I wouldn't say that I have a crystal ball.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.380]   It's telling me what media is going to look like in three years.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.380]   No, I shouldn't say that.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.300]   You know what?
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.100]   This whole company is based on the notion
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.740]   that of a few things-- bandwidth will be high speed, bandwidth
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.780]   will be ubiquitous and affordable,
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.900]   that there won't be caps, that there won't be limitations,
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.700]   that people will have high speed internet,
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:32.180]   that people will be able to consume us in some sort of way
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.100]   that's basically in parity with traditional mainstream media
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.100]   so that the distinction between NBC and Twitter
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.180]   will start to dissolve.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.660]   And most importantly, that audience-- well,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.700]   two most importantly, audience will discover us.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.420]   That's-- we have to work on our discoverability.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.660]   That's not very good right now.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.900]   We're working on that.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.460]   And the second part of that is that the advertisers will--
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.620]   and I feel pretty good about all of these things, by the way,
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.100]   that advertisers will start to realize that this kind of media
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.740]   is as effective, if not more effective,
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.980]   that it is better to buy a small number of engaged viewers
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.300]   than a large number of disengaged viewers.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.340]   And I think that all of the trends are in the right direction.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.980]   And one of the things that we're--
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.660]   that the one thing that we're really working on--
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.300]   because everything else just kind of happens--
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:17.980]   is discoverability.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.460]   That's a real challenge for new media.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.180]   What am I going to do?
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.980]   Buy a billboard on 101, no.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.380]   Am I going to appear on live with Kelly?
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.060]   I've done that.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.900]   Didn't do anything.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.100]   So discoverability is a challenge.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.820]   And what we've moved from is, because it's video,
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.260]   it's not searchable.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.060]   And so I was all worried about search for years.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.060]   And I didn't understand that search
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.660]   was going to get replaced by sharing.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.820]   And so what's very apparent is that the new way of being
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.420]   discoverable is actually the old way.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.100]   It's word of mouth sharing.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.060]   And so what we need to be is not searchable.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.020]   I was all worried about that.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.740]   No, we have to be shareable.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.340]   And so what we're really working on
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.220]   is a way that you could say to a friend,
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.260]   did you see that moment in that show?
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.100]   And then they'd be able to share it.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.380]   If we can do that, I think that's all we have to worry
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.180]   about for discoverability.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.060]   We have to be everywhere people are watching, of course.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.500]   And we're doing that.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.380]   We're building apps.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.300]   Are you--
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.620]   Gina, so you see the connector tissue at Google.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.380]   Give me your Jeremy, too.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.820]   But Gina, what's your view of the elephant?
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.700]   Oh, my view of the elephant is similar to what Jeremy said,
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.860]   is that Google wants every single wave.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.900]   It wants to be part of every single experience
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.980]   that you have all day long.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.500]   And it wants to be able to show you
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.940]   enhanced that experience with information
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.060]   and with advertisements.
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.340]   And glass is part of that.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.180]   I really want to talk about this thing a little bit,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.460]   because I absolutely want to ask.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.100]   These two.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.060]   Boy, you've been begging.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.380]   We will.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.780]   We're going to take a break, and then you can, OK?
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.220]   I think it's very--
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.420]   Let's finish this, and then we'll--
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.580]   We've been talking about this on the show for two years now.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.980]   I mean, I think it's all about capturing signals
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.420]   as with the least amount of friction possible,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.820]   and then presenting an enhanced worldview via devices.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.940]   I'll call you back.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.420]   It's so much fun.
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.940]   The game for us, which I think is kind of like--
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.660]   when I was a kid, I played a lot of chess,
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.540]   and it was fun to watch Grandmasters play
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.220]   and try to imagine what they're doing and why.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.660]   And why do they make that move?
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.220]   And that was really a fun challenge.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.660]   And I feel like that's what we were doing when we watched people.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.580]   It felt like that was Steve Jobs.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.980]   When we watched people like Larry Page,
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.740]   we're watching One Hope's, if one is a stockholder.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.780]   Grandmasters play a game in which they are seeing patterns
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.740]   and moves way ahead of us, and we're trying to understand.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.740]   Now, you're an analyst.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.260]   Is that what analysts do?
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.540]   We do, but it's really hard to see that far ahead
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.140]   with these visionaries, and they have these R&D and think tanks,
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.220]   and they hire the best ideation teams in the world.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.900]   So they have more data than you do?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.380]   Yeah, and they also have a huge team.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.020]   So in our analysis, we tend to look about three years out
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.820]   in disruptive technologies, and we can pretty much forecast
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.340]   a lot of those things.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:56.860]   Really?
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.540]   You feel pretty confident that what you talk about will happen.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.540]   Yeah, if you look at my track record, actually, I've been very--
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.500]   What's next?
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.620]   Tell me what's next.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.700]   Well, I cover social, really.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.500]   That's where we could talk.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.620]   I wish I knew better.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.140]   I have a team of zero.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.140]   Well, you see three years.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.700]   A little more.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.380]   So do you think these guys are Grandmasters?
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.580]   They're pretty good at this?
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:18.940]   Absolutely.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.780]   But again, look at the revenue model.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.300]   I was looking at how much money they make and the percentage of it.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.100]   It's 99% ads.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.500]   All of this is about ads.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.460]   Do you think that that's a concern for Google?
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.300]   No.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.260]   They're happy that--
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.260]   As--
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.660]   I mean, I think there's somewhat of a case to be made, for instance,
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.660]   that ad targeting doesn't work.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.220]   That's a lot of what they're doing.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.940]   There is concern that the targeting is decreasing in accuracy.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.340]   But as more information--
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.340]   Well, shouldn't it be increasing?
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.620]   As they get more signals from your birthday and Google+ and all those things,
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.220]   then it should be more targeted.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.220]   Yeah, it should be getting better.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.620]   That's why they have to get more signals.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.500]   But it moves past targeting to relationships.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:05.940]   You know, this is part of Bob Garfield's view of the chaos scenario.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.780]   When a company--
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.340]   or added docs or roles.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.860]   When you could have a direct relationship of value with a company,
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.060]   that replaces advertising.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.060]   Well, to me, that's the question.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.300]   It's pretty clear banner ads don't work, right?
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.180]   It's pretty-- I mean, do Google ads work?
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.820]   It's not true.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.340]   They do work.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.940]   No, they do work, but it's a low guaranteed CTR.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.260]   But they can promise numbers.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:27.620]   OK.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.220]   It's low.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.940]   It's very, very low.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.860]   If I were making my money, Solana ads,
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.260]   I'd be looking at new ways to reach consumers.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.420]   That's actually what my next research reports on.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.660]   We're looking at how owned media, social media, and advertising
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.860]   is all coming together into a new form we call this converged media.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.980]   Facebook ads, Twitter ads, search ads,
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.220]   those are all examples of that.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.780]   So if you're a company, if you're forward,
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   you have to do a concerted effort along many lines to create a whole--
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.780]   Let's talk about your sponsors, like stams.com.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.820]   Those ads that we will see will start
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.620]   to have the members of the Twitter community creating the content,
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.820]   sharing the content, distributing the content.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:13.020]   It'll be hard to tell who's media, who's the creative,
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.700]   and who's distributing.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.660]   It's all together.
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.220]   The real problem is that your customers don't like ads.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.060]   That's what you do is you don't turn it into an ad.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.580]   When you converge all those things together,
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.420]   your friends help to create that ad.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.980]   You have to be smart about this, because you really--
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.140]   it can't look like you're manipulating.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.780]   It can't look like you're marketing.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.660]   It has to--
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.420]   It has friends or shills, right?
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:35.940]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.580]   But look what happened to Google with this.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.820]   They paid that fee, the judgment on this.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.700]   Your Robert Scobel just like Ford, why don't you?
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.700]   That's an ad with using Robert Scobel's name
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.620]   without his permission.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.740]   And they just paid some money and a settlement for that in the UK.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.260]   So you have to be careful.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.860]   I think as you learn the discoverability for Twit,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.260]   that's a skill that you then bring to your advertisers.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.860]   As you know the skill loyalty, it's a skill
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.820]   you have to find a way to transfer your own.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.940]   I also spend a lot of energy trying to think of--
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.700]   trying to be that the person who's thinking about that, right?
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.220]   And then I realize that agencies are so conservative
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.100]   that you have to let them think of it.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.100]   True enough.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.580]   You can't say, hey, you know what the next thing is.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.580]   You have to wait until they say, hey, you know what the next thing is
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.020]   and say, oh, we could do that.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.820]   You know, this problem discoverability, Leo,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.580]   that you're describing that you have is the problem that Google
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.380]   wants to solve.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.140]   And just as an aside, I meant to say, I just noticed,
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.380]   I don't know where I've been.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.940]   The Twit page on Google+ is fantastic.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.380]   And you post the post shows after they go up.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.500]   Please follow us.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.580]   And I need to make an effort.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.180]   And I've been kind of a slacker about this about resharing that
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.780]   and saying, hey, you know, to make it up.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.980]   Come watch it the day after.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.380]   That's just not something I've been so good at.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.060]   But you know, there are really good ways to do this
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.180]   and really bad ways to do this.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.300]   Like, a car company, which I will not name,
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.140]   but a fancy car company offered me one of their newest models
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.860]   for a week and like three grand.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.860]   And they want to drive the car for a week and blog about it
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.780]   and tweet about it.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.540]   I had to agree to a certain number of blog posts or tweets.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.060]   So that we--
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:17.980]   Oh, that's so gross.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.700]   And I said, no.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.860]   Of course you are.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.700]   Was this because of your cloud score?
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.460]   I've seen the stories about how they
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.980]   award these things now out of cloud scores.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.380]   Yeah, I'm sure that the cloud score
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.340]   is something to do with it.
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.460]   I'm sure they use some sort of metric
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.860]   to figure out that I was, you know, influential in some way.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.940]   That's what cloud wants anyway.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.100]   They certainly hope that that's what
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.020]   will become the currency of the--
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.980]   About rewards you can find some of those in there.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.500]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.500]   Sorry to do that.
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.020]   I have never written about cars.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.260]   I'm not really into cars.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.820]   I mean, I'm just-- it was a really badly targeted--
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:50.340]   Right.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.820]   --it was just not the right person to ask.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.220]   So there are really dumb ways to do this
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.980]   and really smart ways to do this.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.180]   On the other hand, if Gina, if Google went to you and said,
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.100]   here's a Nexus 7, could you talk about it?
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:03.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.780]   They did.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.780]   I was first in line of business.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.220]   I think love this thing.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.700]   Ultimate Android device.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.460]   I have not touched my iPad in two weeks,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.540]   and I love my iPad.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.700]   But that's not because Google gave you one at all.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.660]   That's because you genuinely love it.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.540]   Because I love-- well, they did give it to me at I/O.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:26.820]   So I will--
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.340]   Right.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.180]   --I'll-- I'm certainly should disclose that.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.540]   But I buy three of these.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.060]   Right.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:31.700]   It's fantastic.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:32.220]   I bought one.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:32.860]   I haven't got it yet.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   Apparently two to three days.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.860]   I wish I had it.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   They say two to three.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.860]   The chatroom said they talked to somebody at Google today
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.020]   and said the rep said two to three days.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.580]   They start shipping.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.740]   It is so fast and so great.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.180]   And Chrome is amazing.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.300]   I feel like when I was thinking about Google I/O 2011,
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.860]   there were so many announcements that just--
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.300]   nothing came out of them.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.300]   There's not anything that we've been talking about now.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.500]   But just-- we were discussing a minute ago
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.820]   is that we're just starting to see the shape of things.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.820]   Like this device, like seeing Chrome as the default browser
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.740]   in Google now and seeing Jelly Bean with butter.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.220]   Like see it be so responsive and seeing the Play Store
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.860]   start to come into its own, although it
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.940]   needs a lot more content in it to be really good.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.300]   But to be at this point with Android
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.300]   where the app selection is great now,
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.580]   every single app that I'd ever want is now available for Android.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.660]   It's like, hi, get it.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.420]   Like this is where they've been going with it.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.300]   This is a great device.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:22.820]   I love it.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.820]   Gina, I've been using the Kindle Fire.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.540]   See, I brought them all.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.860]   I got the Samsung Galaxy Tab.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.620]   They're all the same form factor.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.460]   The Nexus is lightest, and it feels good in your hand.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.700]   But the fire, the UI, is really clunky,
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.060]   because it's not one that we need.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.300]   Well, it's also slow hardware.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.900]   The fire is an example of a compromised hardware
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.380]   to get that price down.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.980]   And that's what's kind of neat about this,
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.340]   is that they got that price point without-- right?
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.380]   Gina without compromising the hardware.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.220]   Right, exactly.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.180]   Now, rumor has it that they're not
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.740]   making any money on this thing.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.220]   Right.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:57.540]   They don't.
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.180]   They-- no, they-- it's not rumor.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.020]   They said it.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.140]   I mean, this is an interface to the Play Store, right?
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.460]   They're making a bet that you're going
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.180]   to buy stuff in the Play Store on this thing.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:09.540]   And the default skin is very Play Store-centric.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.020]   Yes, if you go home, I'll just show you real quickly.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.860]   That's the home page, right?
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.140]   This is very Kindle Fire-like.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.660]   Yes.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.220]   You know, there's clear that that's the home page.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.460]   The Amazon is losing money on the fire surely, too, right?
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.620]   I'm sure they are, yeah.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.180]   The teardown cost for the Nexus 7,
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.100]   it's in the rundown, was $152.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.460]   $152.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.060]   OK.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.660]   OK.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.820]   A marketing cost, right?
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.420]   In another episode of--
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.820]   Yeah, they're bet that's probably breaking even.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.140]   But Gina, have you used the Nexus in the sun?
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.700]   Yeah, but so what?
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.140]   I have it.
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.740]   Same with the iPad.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.940]   It's kind of a dim screen, to be honest with you.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.180]   It is an IPS display, right?
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.180]   So that would be very comparable to the iPad.
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.540]   It's not an OLED or--
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.540]   It's an IPS LCD display.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.420]   You know, I thought Jeff was crazy for saying
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.700]   that he liked the small, that fablet thing.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.260]   No, this is the right size.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.940]   This is-- oh, this is the right size.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.820]   And you know, you can lay--
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.620]   I read in bed a lot, reading books and reading
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.540]   into paper in bed is very comfortable,
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.500]   because it's one-handed.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.500]   It's extremely light.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.500]   It's just great.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.140]   It's all the things that I didn't use about the iPad.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.740]   I never use the iPad's back camera.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.140]   This doesn't have it.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.860]   I mean, it's Wi-Fi only, of course.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.900]   It's so fast.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.940]   I mean, I like to just swipe around on this thing,
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.300]   because it's just so fast and responsive.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.300]   Jeremiah, you had--
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   You had a chart.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.300]   Go ahead.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   All right.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.300]   Jeremiah, you had the--
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.660]   In fact, you have it in front of you,
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.380]   the seven-inch Galaxy Tab.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.820]   When I first got that, which was a year ago, wasn't it?
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.340]   I kind of fell in love with that size.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.700]   You did too.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.100]   Yeah, you liked it too, Jeff.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.100]   So how does this--
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.140]   The problem was the software was fairly clunky at that stage.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.380]   The typing was awful.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.420]   I hated Honeycomb.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.620]   That was the real problem.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.500]   That was the real issue.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.620]   It was not thought through as a tablet.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.500]   It was rushed out.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.180]   How does this compare, do you think, Jeremiah?
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   I don't really use this.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.180]   This is Charlene's.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.180]   She should be honest.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.220]   We've been with the fire for the month.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:04.660]   I'll tell you, one thing I like about the seven, that the Samsung tablet, is it has a camera
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.660]   on the back?
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.660]   This one does not.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.660]   Right.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.660]   Oddly enough.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.660]   And that one is light.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.660]   Feel this compared to the fire.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.580]   Yeah, the fire is a lot thicker and heavier.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.100]   It's just clunky and heavy.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.860]   Although, I have to say, I was one of the few people who actually thought the fire was
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.100]   a great product.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.860]   But this now supersedes it for sure.
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.860]   It is.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.860]   This is the next generation.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.860]   It comes with the Transformers.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.900]   So if you're Amazon, what do you do now?
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.460]   Because they have rumors of new devices.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.620]   You ship a new Kindle and they better do it quick.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.460]   The rumor is it won't be for a few months, which I think is probably...
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.860]   So we should assume price points are going to drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.460]   So especially when Christmas comes around, I don't know.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   Could these just get down?
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   A hundred dollar?
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.460]   I'm saying sub-hundred.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   If you get sub-hundred on something like this, everybody buys one just as an impulse purchase,
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.460]   right?
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.660]   You buy this.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.460]   It's sitting next to the People magazine at the grocery store.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.460]   And you go, I'll take one of those two.
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.540]   And you're just throwing in your cart.
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.900]   I mean, it gets to be that point, right?
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.380]   Yeah, sub-hundred for sure.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.300]   I mean, Amazon still has a much better catalog, a Play Store.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.300]   Absolutely.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.300]   Absolutely.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.500]   But what you get with the Nexus 7 is you get the whole suite of Google apps, Gmail,
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.500]   Calendar, Maps.
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.500]   I mean, that's all...
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.300]   Is this why Apple's doing a 7-inch?
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.620]   Yeah, they have to get into this game.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.620]   They have to.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.180]   This is about media distribution.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.180]   This is...
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.180]   So we have three...
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.220]   We have three media libraries, right?
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.620]   iTunes, Play, and Amazon.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.620]   Right.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.580]   I have to say this is pretty awesome.
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   Now...
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:38.420]   So, Gina, if you were doing a chart of the Nexus 7 versus your iPad, what you loved,
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   this is fast.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.220]   Can you give me an offer?
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.260]   You're selling this to a friend.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.260]   You just like Android.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.260]   You like the flow.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.660]   You like feeling it.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.660]   And I get all that.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.160]   And I'm going to be the same way.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:58.900]   But as a marketing message, what makes the Nexus 7 competitive?
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.260]   Honestly, I mean, for some...
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:05.380]   200 bucks for something that's powerful and great and small and like, it's a no-brainer.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.380]   It's really the price.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.380]   Like...
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.380]   It's the look price.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.380]   Like, I'm telling...
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   Yeah, it's about price.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.380]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.380]   It's about price.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.380]   I agree.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.380]   I agree.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   Depending on who the friend is, my sister-in-law told me that she's in the market for a tablet.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   And I said, "This is a couple of weeks before Google I/O."
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.380]   And I said, "Just hang on to see what Google's going to release."
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.820]   She said, "I want to spend about 200 bucks."
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.620]   People don't want to spend $500.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   Right.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.220]   You know, on a giant tablet.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.920]   And I have a different relationship with the iPad.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.520]   The iPad is this beautiful slab.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.160]   But this thing, I feel like I just live with a little bit more.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.560]   It's just lighter and it's got that kind of leathery feel.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.200]   I feel like it's something that I just...
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   That I kind of grab more...
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   It's more casual.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.200]   It's more casual.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   It's more casual.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.340]   I'm addicted now to my keyboard case for my iPad.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.240]   I'm worried about withdrawal from that.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.240]   Can you hold it up?
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   I want to see Jeff.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.240]   Maya.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.240]   He's talking about this.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.240]   Here you can play with it.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.240]   This is the ultra thin...
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.500]   It works with a sub.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.500]   It works with a 7.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   Any Bluetooth keyboard does.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.500]   Yeah, I know.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   But it doesn't fold.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.500]   It doesn't.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.940]   You know, how long before somebody makes a little?
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.940]   Well, I think soon.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   But that's my one concern is that I need that because it does make me fluid.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.620]   It makes me not fear having a type on.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.620]   How do I start a hangout?
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.620]   Can I start a hangout?
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.620]   I want to use this camera.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.500]   How do I start a hangout?
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.740]   Go to the sidebar.
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.640]   So click home, sidebar, hangout.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.480]   Glad somebody knows how to use this.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.940]   Oh, I don't know any of these people.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.140]   Who should I start a hangout with?
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.740]   I start one with me.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.740]   No, no, no, no.
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.740]   These aren't my friends.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.740]   Yeah, just...
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.740]   Oh, type in Chad.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.740]   See if it happens.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.740]   No, because this is Jeremiah.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:36.740]   That's fine.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:37.740]   My friends are your friends.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   Okay.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   Chad Johnson.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.860]   My ex-girlfriends in it will be okay.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.700]   They're not on here anyway.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.700]   Ring on.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.700]   What does this mean now?
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   It's not.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.260]   Yeah, I believe that...
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.260]   Start.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.260]   There it is.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.260]   Actually, Martin, are you in Google+?
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.260]   Hey!
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.260]   Look at that.
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.300]   Waiting for Chad to join.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.300]   Let's see.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.100]   Here's the old redhead himself.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.100]   Hi, Chad.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.100]   How are you?
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.100]   Good to see you.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.100]   Okay, here we go.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.100]   One second.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.140]   Now, see, this is the point of the front-facing camera.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.140]   And I guess they figured nobody's going to take pictures with this.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.140]   This is probably not so far off.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.140]   That's a reasonable assumption.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.940]   How many pictures have you taken with five?
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.940]   Right.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:15.940]   And it saves you money.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.940]   20 bucks on the cost.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.180]   I've taken lots of pictures of whiteboards.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:24.140]   I've taken lots of pictures of white people, so there you go.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.460]   Oh, Chad, don't worry about it.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.180]   He's running to get a camera.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:29.180]   It's okay.
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.180]   I'll call somebody...
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.180]   I'll call...
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.180]   Really, what do you got there?
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.180]   What are you using?
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.180]   Gino.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.580]   Yeah, I could call Gino.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.580]   See?
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.580]   I don't know.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.780]   Anyway, that's cool.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.780]   That's cool.
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:45.420]   By the way, you saw there's a new feature for Hangouts that I think it's after you're
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.420]   off.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.740]   It will give you a transcript of the whole thing.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.140]   A written transcript?
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.140]   Wow.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.140]   Do you mean voice to text?
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.740]   Well, automatically does that?
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.740]   Yep.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.740]   Okay, I admit...
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.740]   Here's the thing.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.020]   Okay, 200 bucks, but here's the significant difference between this and the fire.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.540]   It's fast.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.100]   And that's the butter.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.380]   There is a reason for jelly bean.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.420]   That is noticeably.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.220]   You feel the speed of that.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.780]   Even compared to my quad core Galaxy S3, it feels fast.
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.540]   We're going to take a break.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.500]   We're talking with Jeremiah O'Yang.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:20.420]   A web strategist who's looking three years ahead of everybody else, Gino Tupani, who
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.900]   lives three years ahead of everybody else, and me and Jeff who are living in the past.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.900]   We're three hours.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:31.260]   We just wish Dallas should come back on the...
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.340]   Wait a minute, it did.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.340]   Nothing from Jeff.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.340]   I thought...
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.340]   Oh, is he frozen?
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.340]   Oh, no.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.340]   He's yawning.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.340]   He's in the past.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.340]   No, I'm...
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.340]   Larry Hagman.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.340]   Larry Hagman.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.340]   Jeff.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.340]   Larry Hagman.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.340]   Linda Evans.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.820]   I was never into Dallas that much.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.300]   What do you think of newsroom?
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.660]   Oh, I hate it.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.660]   Yeah, me too.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:56.660]   Hate it.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   I'm very disappointed.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.660]   And despise it.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.580]   But, sanctimonious.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:09.540]   And now we people, my people, my people, media, understand what he did to technology
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.540]   people.
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.700]   And in fact, he's still doing it to technology people.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.340]   He acts as if Twitter and email are like something new.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.340]   And a cheap...
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:21.620]   You have a blog?
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.780]   His vision for news is retrograde.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:26.780]   I want Uncle Walter back.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:27.780]   I want him to explain the world.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.940]   And in that first show, the structure he showed of having no script and stay in just
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:37.340]   ahead is a venue for precisely how CNN screwed up the Supreme Court decision.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.340]   Yep.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.820]   And not thinking, not doing their work, not holding back.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.980]   And it's just utter credit.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.980]   And the speech of fine is just so obnoxious.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.340]   It's pretty apparent that Sorkin hates women.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.620]   I mean, all the women are ditzes in this.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.340]   I, Leo, I just sent a, I just misused autocomplete and outlook twice.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.660]   You see, you're a woman.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.420]   Of course you did.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.220]   And by the way, knock something over, would you?
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.220]   No, seriously.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.140]   I'm going to fall down on my heel while I'm running through the newsroom.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.580]   Yeah, because you're a woman.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.220]   I don't care if you were embedded in Iraq.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.100]   I don't care if you're the greatest journalist ever.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.180]   Please knock over that whiteboard.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.980]   I don't understand what an email alias is so hard.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.980]   Don't get it.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.580]   Oh, wait, let me check it back.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:27.260]   It's exactly what was in the social network that we didn't like about the social network.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:31.340]   And now I'm terrified because this is the same guy who's writing the Steve Jobs bio pick.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.700]   That's going to be a disaster.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:42.820]   Or he'll see no, he'll see Steve Jobs as the paragon that should be all technology.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.320]   The smart guy who knows best, who controls everything, who doesn't let these rattle
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:53.420]   rousers decide what should happen in the world, who delivers something from a view of quality
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.060]   and really doesn't respect the world that much.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.860]   That's the way he's going to present Steve Jobs.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:57:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.860]   Ah.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:04.020]   Gina, knock something over first.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.260]   You did you.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.260]   I love the eternal.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.620]   Let's talk about news night is one of my favorite things to watch because it gets so angry about
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.620]   it.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.620]   I love it.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:13.620]   It's awesome.
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.620]   You know, I was all excited because I want to romanticize the newsroom and romanticize
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.620]   television.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.900]   I like that, but this thing is just, oh my God.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.620]   You know, after I watched a couple of newsroom things, I went back and I watched part of social
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:25.620]   network.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.620]   Same problem.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:35.100]   The, um, the pre-trefying, the world view just got even harder terms and worse terms as far
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.100]   as I'm inserting.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.820]   I think what you know, I'm the odd one, but no, I think what you catch on to sort because
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:43.980]   I, sort of musical with language, but once you catch on to him, you realize, oh, big
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.980]   strum.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.940]   I've heard that tune somewhere before.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.900]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.460]   If you love that show, it's a wonderful, wonderful show.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.460]   No, it's not.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.380]   No, I mean, we like Glee.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.940]   What, what kind of taste do we have?
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:00.140]   What do we know?
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:01.140]   It's true.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.140]   It's strong.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.140]   I caught to that.
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:04.140]   It's true.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.380]   Now, but this guy used to be a television reviewer.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.380]   He's got credentials.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.820]   He's a, he's a trained journalist.
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:16.420]   But that gave Babylon five a bad review and the geeks will never forgive me for that.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.420]   No, that's unforgivable.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.460]   And somebody in the chatroom said, and I kind of agree that he's giving a circuit a
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.460]   pass.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:25.260]   We'll always give them a pass because of West Wing, which was a good show.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.260]   So, but you know what?
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.300]   I'll bet if you went back to the same problem, the problem.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.860]   Romanisizing bull BS.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.860]   Sorkin took great pride in the fact that he never figured, never studied how the White
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.860]   House worked.
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.620]   And Sorkin is an elitist.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:43.620]   That's the opposite of what I think the internet is about and journalism should be about.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.180]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.660]   And it's the same problem with Port Dixie.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.660]   Get me started, Leo.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.100]   I know you're trying to get a sponsor in.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.900]   It's the same problem with, uh, what's his name, the wire, the data.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.900]   I love him.
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:56.900]   You don't like him?
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.140]   Uh, he's in his attitude toward newspapers and such.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.740]   It's still that kind of elitist, you know, of you knew.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   Season, season two.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.740]   Season two is all about the newsroom.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.140]   That was kind of interesting, but you're probably right.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.700]   It was, it was a little bit, uh, his gal Friday as his news newsroom.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:13.700]   Totally.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.700]   He'll skis gal Friday.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.700]   All right.
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.140]   I keep waiting for Catherine Hepburn to show up.
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.500]   Spencer Tracy is the editor.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.740]   Which is Jill Abrams, the editor of the New York Times now.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.460]   That's her favorite newspaper movie.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.660]   Oh, it's the greatest of all time.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.460]   She did a, uh, interview.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.960]   But talk about dated.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.980]   That's why newspapers were still printed on trees.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.460]   Dead trees.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.460]   I liked, you know, I, I, it was the one thing I missed last week is I wish I could talk
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.300]   to Jeff about newsroom.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.020]   And now you've satisfied my, you see, it got me started, Leo.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.020]   I knew I would.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.820]   Now we just have to talk about Louie and, and, and it'll be complete, but we should,
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.820]   we should do a sponsor.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.260]   Yeah, I've been watching, I've cashed up with season two.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.460]   I'm watching season two because it's on Netflix.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.460]   Has season three started?
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.220]   Yeah, it's two episodes in.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.220]   He's so amazing.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.220]   Yes.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.100]   There's a guy, there's a guy's guy.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:08.660]   And now at Louis CK, we're talking about he, he's selling his own tickets to, to, to
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.060]   kill some cowers.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.900]   He's killed 95% of all the scalping on his concert.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.060]   Everything he's doing is going direct.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.660]   And that's what the internet does.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.660]   I know.
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.460]   And it helps that he's Louis CK.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.820]   I mean, if I started my comedy career trying to sell tickets to, it wouldn't work.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.220]   It helps.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:30.180]   I put up a link to David Weinberger on his blog, Hyperorg, Joho, did a brilliant essay
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:36.180]   about, about how what Louis CK did with the scalpers and with the show itself was indicative
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:43.220]   of our opportunity to reset norms on the net around a simple rule, which is pardon me
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.220]   for this.
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.660]   Let's try not to be dicks.
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:51.260]   And, and, and, and, and, and it's really a brilliant piece because it talks about it.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:58.940]   It actually also goes through the, the veld onshoung of the worldview of Seinfeld and of,
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.540]   uh, curb your enthusiasm and then of Louis CK and at Louis CK, his whole thing is let's
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.740]   try not to be a dick.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.100]   And that that's the opportunity the net gives us.
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:15.740]   And he just uses his, uh, uh, direct relationship with his fans in his show and against scalpers
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.660]   as an example of doing just that.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.660]   It's really a wonderful piece.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:19.660]   Just do the right thing.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.660]   I don't like that.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.180]   Because we have the chance to now, we have the chance to rethink these norms.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.780]   We can screw it up, but our norms are all open for questioning and there.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.620]   And I think that's why, uh, I don't know about you, but that's why I love Louis, the
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.740]   show, Louis, because it's, it's like a breath of fresh air.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.780]   It's like, you know, you don't have to be an on automatic.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.940]   You could think about this for a minute and then you can see it for the truth of it as
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.460]   opposed to just kind of, as we mostly do in life, just kind of, well, that's how we
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.460]   were boys done.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.620]   And so we'll just keep doing it that way.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.980]   Here's a chance to step back and say, Oh, different.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.660]   I like that.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.180]   So already two episodes, huh?
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.180]   Yeah, two episodes.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.220]   I want to see it till next year.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.700]   What channel is that on?
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.700]   FX FX.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.700]   Okay.
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.700]   I probably get that.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.980]   I don't think you can get it on.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:14.140]   On my cable, I don't think it comes on the on demand or on Hulu either, which is upsetting.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.140]   Right.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.700]   And if you're on, if you're on, uh, dish or direct TV, they're turning it off right
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.940]   as we speak.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.940]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.620]   That's a mess.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.620]   What the hell's going on there?
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:31.300]   God, this is why the internet's going to win because ultimately these stakeholders are
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.540]   just going to kill each other off.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.540]   It's like dinosaurs.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.700]   You're just going to find the risk is they want to turn the internet into cable.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.700]   I know.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.700]   Right.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700]   And they own it so they can.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.100]   Well, that's what these, these media platforms that we just talked about are part of the
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:52.340]   that game, but the carriers are unfortunately Comcast and VC Verizon and AT&T.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.580]   I mean, we've got to get them through that network.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.100]   Yeah, we got to get around that.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.100]   Let's build our own.
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:01.580]   Let's launch a satellite or something Verizon, which just filed an FCC complaint against
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.500]   their net neutrality power, arguing that that Verizon has a first amendment right to decide
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:10.540]   what goes on the internet and a fourth amendment property right to decide as well.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.700]   Well, this was actually this.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   I don't think that's new.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:19.300]   I think that's always been the contention that the FCC doesn't have standing is the point,
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.300]   right?
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.300]   Right.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.780]   But to argue that there's a first amendment right on behalf of the cable provider to decide
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:30.180]   what does and does not go through its wire star house that is not just a common carrier
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.980]   to the internet, it's not just access to the internet, that it is a newspaper.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:38.860]   It gives the idea that the analogy it makes is that it is a newspaper Verizon is a newspaper
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.380]   and it decide what gets published.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.180]   There's a side effect to that that they're going to regret, which is that they're now
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.540]   responsible for what gets published.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.500]   Yes.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.020]   But that's where Cisco comes in too, right?
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:56.820]   So Cisco technology in place to stop us from our own evolution instincts.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.620]   Well, the analog is YouTube.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.020]   YouTube doesn't want to be responsible for what people put on there.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:01.980]   They're a carrier.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.980]   Right.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.780]   But as soon as you say, well, no, we're a publisher, then YouTube is responsible for
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.980]   every single thing on every single page.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.540]   And it's difficult to do anyway.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.540]   Let me do an ad.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.380]   I'm sorry, it's half an hour.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:19.260]   The only reason, hey, I just need to, we need to pay for the bills.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   We love this.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.340]   We need to think we got lights.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.500]   We got a table.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   Somebody's got to buy the table.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.540]   We got a guy named Chad.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.900]   He's five bucks an hour, but I still got to pay him stuff like that.
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.540]   That ain't right.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.540]   More Chad.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.540]   No, he's more than five.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.540]   I hope he's one.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.540]   I don't really know.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.540]   I'm five fifty.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.980]   The way I get out of this, I wash my hands of it.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.860]   I have no idea what he's paid.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:46.700]   I'm sure it's a fair living wage, but I don't know.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.700]   This show brought you, no, it's fair, right?
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.700]   Yeah, it's fair.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.300]   I don't even know what it is.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:57.260]   I really don't know what we pay you.
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.980]   I don't handle that.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.980]   But if it's not, let me know.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:03.220]   And I'll be free to Lisa.
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.980]   This show.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.660]   It was brought to you by.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.380]   I don't know what Ford paid for this either though, so it goes both ways.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:19.460]   By Ford Motor Company.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.460]   My dog is excited.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.460]   Aussie want to go for riding the Mustang?
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.460]   Come on, boy.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.460]   Let's go for riding them.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.980]   Aussie loves Ford Sync, but you know what he's really excited about?
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.980]   He's really excited about the new AppLink API that lets developers write software that
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.620]   sits on top of the platform.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.780]   That is your vehicle.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.940]   Your vehicle has sensors.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.940]   It's got capabilities.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.060]   It's got wireless, all this stuff.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.340]   And now you get in, your smartphone, and it's interfacing with it.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:50.540]   And suddenly your car is like the ADK.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.380]   It becomes a part of your environment.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.140]   And actually, Ford's demonstrating this.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.740]   They kind of have done a reference application, the MyFord mobile app.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:04.420]   Now, if you want to take a look at it, you go to an EV certified Ford dealer and drive
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:11.260]   the new 2012 electric focus, because this works with the electric vehicles only.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.660]   And what will happen is, for instance, the app knows where your car is at all.
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:19.060]   You can find out about this at Ford.com/technology as well.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.420]   Your app knows exactly where your car is.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.100]   I love this thing.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.140]   I'll show this picture.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.220]   Where's my car?
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.220]   Why?
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.140]   It's right here.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.020]   It also knows where the nearest plugs are if you want to charge it up.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:38.820]   It's also-- so you get a map of all the charging stations in your area.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.700]   You also get your state of charge.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.460]   In fact, if the car is in the garage and you're in the living room, you can still use the
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.460]   app.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.140]   It talks to the car, so you can say, charge now.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.460]   Or hey, I'm going to get in the car at 8.30 tomorrow morning.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   Could you make sure it's 72 degrees in the cabin or on these hot days?
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.260]   You might want to say 65 degrees.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.780]   And it uses the electricity to do this.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:59.380]   This is available for BlackBerry, Android, and iOS.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.980]   It's called the MyFord mobile app.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:06.380]   So when you go to your EV certified Ford dealer to test drive the 2012 Ford Focus Electric,
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.580]   bring your phone and download the app.
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.860]   And then you can see how it works.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.380]   It's really sweet.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:16.180]   They also have a MyFord mobile website where you can-- there's some gamification here.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.980]   You can see who saved the most CO2 today.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.860]   How much money have you saved?
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.540]   I just think this is-- remember, it's a demo.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.500]   This is what they want-- I mean, it's more than a demo.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.100]   It's a working demo.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:33.180]   So this is an example of what you can do when your car talks to your phone.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:39.300]   The MyFord mobile app, just one of many amazing innovations you can find at Ford.com/technology
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.860]   or at your Ford dealer.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.220]   Visit one today.
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.980]   Bring your phone and try it out.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.060]   So if I have a CloudScore of 76--
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.060]   Let's see your perks.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.380]   Let's see what my perks are.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.500]   By the way, can you tell-- I don't belong to Cloud.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   I don't plan to.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.020]   I don't know what my CloudScore is.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.620]   I have no idea what my CloudScore is.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.060]   Well, just go to Cloud and you--
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.420]   No, well, you have to sign up for it.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.420]   I won't do it.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:08.780]   Well, you don't even want to give them any Cloud, so to speak.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   OK, I can get 50 business cards from Moo.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.100]   I could save up to-- see, this is not-- you could show this.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.780]   This is not anything I would-- I could save rent on the runway.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.860]   No, sorry, you're not eligible.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.700]   How to be eligible?
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.900]   I need a CloudScore above one.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.260]   I think you started to want it.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:28.980]   A lot of these aren't particularly good.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.180]   Yeah, see, this perk is open to other influencers.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.220]   Is this the one that was giving you a car?
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.660]   Acura-ILX?
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.660]   No.
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:38.180]   No.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.180]   No, they--
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.180]   We have to guess.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.180]   Jog war?
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.340]   They emailed me directly, so it wasn't--
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.820]   they didn't mention Cloud, but I imagine that--
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.660]   But this is like a paper post.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.700]   This is trying to buy the--
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:49.620]   Oh, it's horrible.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.820]   Because they supposedly have Cloud.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:55.180]   Here's what you have to say if you drive this Acura.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.940]   I was given a free product or sample
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.860]   because I'm a Cloud influencer.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.940]   I was under no obligation to review the sample
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.260]   or talk about this company.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.020]   I get no additional benefits for talking
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.060]   about the product or company.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.780]   So one of the posts I did that drew a lot of attention
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.940]   is when you combine Cloud with Google Glass.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.740]   And you can go about the world.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.740]   That's Damon.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.940]   That's straight out of Daniel Suarez,
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.180]   where you have your reputation score floating above your head.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:19.680]   Exactly.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.140]   And you can go to a party and then people are going to--
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.900]   Oh, he's got a lot of Cloud.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.420]   Right.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.700]   Hey, you're a nice guy.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.940]   I just envision that as Robert Scobles worldview.
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.380]   Yes, he wishes.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.740]   He wishes Cloud would give you something.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.940]   I say that lovingly, Robert.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.340]   Oh, he would agree with you.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.740]   And I think when that happens, people with high Cloud scores
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.020]   will also get discounts, special treatments--
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:45.540]   Right.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.060]   --free products.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.660]   Here's what's wrong about that.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.220]   An example that I have at hand that's very easy
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:53.820]   is I had absolutely no Cloud, no influence whatsoever.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.140]   You're 65.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.300]   In the PC-- no, wait, wait, in the PC market, the laptop market,
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.460]   when I complained about my Dell computer,
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.860]   what had influence was my message.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:06.100]   And there was no way to predict that this guy named Jarvis, who
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.140]   comes on conventions with dirty words about his computer,
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.660]   was going to start a storm.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.900]   Because the message was at the right time.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.540]   Yeah, the fact that I had some people following me
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.820]   helped it spread a little easier.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.100]   But I was zero Cloud in that category.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:18.740]   But that--
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.620]   What's your Twitter handle, Jeff?
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.900]   What's your Twitter handle, Jeff?
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.020]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.900]   That was because you identified that Google products
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.220]   and the support had an issue.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.940]   You were the voice of the people.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.940]   It didn't have to do with direct influence.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.900]   Well, that's what I'm saying though, Jeremy,
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.020]   is that the notion of Cloud that someone
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.460]   is an influencer and is predictable as such
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.620]   is wrong, because the person who have supposedly
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.580]   has influence can say something that doesn't resonate.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.380]   The person who has zero influence can say something
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:44.940]   that resonates.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.820]   And that's what happened.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:48.100]   But also, when that happened was in 2006,
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.540]   I think I read you do that or something like that.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.380]   There were very few people blogging
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.900]   compared to the amount of people on social now.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.460]   Now we have to have identifiers because everybody's
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:58.940]   doing it.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.940]   What the adoption rates in social networking are--
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.340]   But I was still trying to say--
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:06.140]   I'm still saying that the idea that you can measure someone's
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:10.100]   Cloud as a predictor of their influence is fallacious.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:10.740]   No, I agree.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.780]   OK, so Cloud is great for absolute value.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.340]   But when you look at the relative value,
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.340]   which is specific topics, obviously,
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:20.180]   media journalism advertising, we go to you.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.580]   But if it's PC computers, perhaps you--
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.300]   But isn't that the problem with authority in general is?
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.540]   In fact, I remember this from talking to--
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:29.780]   who was it?
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.460]   Mr. Twitter was the guy who did this originally.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.980]   And he said, the problem is I have a lot of authority
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.860]   when I-- to my kids and my parents,
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.380]   I might have zero authority to you.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.220]   I'm have a lot of authority when I talk about--
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:42.580]   I--
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.100]   --twit, but I might have zero authority when
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.700]   talk about tires.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.340]   So how do you measure authority?
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.740]   I mean, Cloud is a very brute force way to do that.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.940]   I think that's why you have a problem.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.980]   There's a number-- there's peer indexers.
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.340]   There's so many of these.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.140]   Edelman has built their own.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.700]   But they do put in some keywords.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.620]   And you can tag people.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.060]   And people have been saying you're
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:04.060]   like influential at raspberries and blueberries
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.580]   and ranches.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.660]   So it's not perfect.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.380]   But people glom onto numbers.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.140]   And by the way, the number of brands that use Cloud--
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:12.620]   It is interesting.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.980]   --is very, very, very high.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.460]   Because it's embedded in Radian 6
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.980]   and a number of social monitoring tools.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.660]   So they've got into it.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.900]   They're buying a crock.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.820]   That's what I think.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.860]   I think what's more interesting is
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.500]   who the influencers are listening to.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.700]   I've been really obsessed with the idea of if you're not
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:32.420]   an influencer by it's clout measure or whatever.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.140]   If you don't have a ton of followers,
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.380]   but you have relationships with people maybe who do,
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.420]   the car company that comes to me and says,
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.140]   you should drive our car around and here we'll give you
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:42.780]   money to talk about.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.380]   That's one thing.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.500]   But if someone I respect admire it,
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.380]   Leo asked me to do something or try something.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.540]   I'm going to listen to him.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.380]   I think that's kind of the next step here.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.340]   It's like, how do we get people who are not influential?
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.340]   And I'm using that term.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.500]   However you measure that.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.860]   Who do they care about?
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.820]   And who are they listening to?
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.580]   Because the people who have tons of followers
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.660]   and a high clout score, they're just blocked off.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.660]   Half of them can't answer their email
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:08.820]   or can't sort through all their Twitter mentions or whatever.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.860]   And it's possible to get to them.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.660]   So here's the thing.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.820]   And I advise a lot of brands on how
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.980]   to deal with social influencers.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:18.380]   And I say, should you treat people like Leo
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:21.100]   with high clout scores higher than other people?
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.100]   And they're like, no way.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:22.700]   That's horrible.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.900]   That teaches a bad behavior.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.100]   And I say, well, do you treat customers
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.900]   with high net value differently?
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.220]   And they go, oh, yes, we do.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:30.740]   Sure.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.340]   It's the same thing.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.900]   Those of us who are better looking and richer than others
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.900]   should get more.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.940]   Wow.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:41.540]   Lady Gaga, how do you think she's going
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:42.740]   to run her social network?
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.580]   Little Monsters.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.020]   Are you a member, Gina?
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.060]   Little Monsters?
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.260]   Are you a little monster?
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.220]   I'm a little monster.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.380]   I thought you might be.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.500]   I signed up.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.420]   Really?
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.380]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.580]   You really are?
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:54.340]   I really am.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.540]   I really--
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.260]   How did I know?
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.260]   So I'll admit I didn't know about it until I saw it
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:14:59.900]   in the rundown.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.060]   But I signed up instantly.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.340]   I was like, oh, I was scanning our story rundown.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.620]   And I was like, lady Gaga, I was new as social network.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:10.340]   I said, I signed in instantly.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.420]   So it's out of beta.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.540]   Tell me what it looks like.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:13.500]   Let's do it.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.100]   It looks a lot like Pinterest.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.740]   Interestingly, you can sign in with either your Facebook
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.620]   or your Twitter account.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.580]   And then it asks you for a couple of little more information
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.180]   your birthday, maybe your name.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.540]   What's the address?
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.340]   It's little monsters.com.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:30.620]   That's what she calls her fans, is little monsters.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:30.980]   Right.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.140]   That's what she calls her fans.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:33.780]   And it's very-- it looks--
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   the primary UI looks very similar to Pinterest.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.940]   And then it's like--
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.380]   it's photo based.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.100]   And Gaga is your friend by default.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.500]   So when you sign in, you see--
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.140]   Gaga is the upgraded Tom.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.220]   And you just see a lot of images from Gaga, which is--
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.300]   as a fan, that's what I want.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:56.100]   But there's a chat on the sidebar.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.340]   And yeah, it looks cool.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.700]   I don't know that I'm going to spend a lot of time here.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.420]   Because it's very Gaga-centric.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.860]   Is it media consumption or is it for social interaction?
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.500]   What are you using it for?
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.740]   It seems like-- well, like I said,
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.300]   I only signed up a few hours ago.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.420]   So I haven't spent a lot of time.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.140]   It seems like this is for fans to meet one another in chat.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.340]   So there's live chat on the sidebar.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.740]   And then there's-- you can share links and images,
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.740]   a lot of stuff about sort of all of Gaga's--
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:23.780]   So if this works--
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.820]   --the full name and fashion--
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.820]   If this works, the other artists are going to do this.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.620]   That's the question.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.940]   This replaces--
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.300]   somebody's going to white label this, and this replaces
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.580]   my space or Ning.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.900]   This probably was the idea behind Ning.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.700]   Yeah, something like this, right.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.900]   Create your own social network.
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.620]   It owns this versus going through a platform.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.140]   Right.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:42.220]   So this can become widely--
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.220]   This isn't so very different from what you might create
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.780]   on a MySpace page either, right?
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.860]   I mean--
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.700]   Formally known as--
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:49.820]   It's very much like Pinterest.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.740]   That's interesting how--
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.060]   It looks like Pinterest.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.580]   But there's the Game Monsters group.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.900]   There's the Brazilian Monsters group.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.140]   And you can click on one of those in the right sidebar,
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.220]   and you can start to chat.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.300]   This is really a lifestyle social site.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.820]   So I wonder, is this the next big thing?
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:11.540]   Not just for Gaga, for other--
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.100]   For Gaga, yeah.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:12.620]   For artists.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.740]   You have to have massive, massive following for this to work.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.660]   She does.
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:17.020]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:17.660]   And she does.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:17.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.620]   But you have to gather around.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.300]   You have to gather around something common.
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.540]   That's what she's not just music.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.060]   It's very glee-like, right?
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.420]   It's losers like us.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.980]   It's an affinity group.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.220]   It's fashion.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.180]   It's culture.
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:31.940]   It's dance.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:32.380]   I mean, it's--
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:32.980]   It's affirmation.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.980]   It's affirmation.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.980]   Mm-hmm.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:36.980]   Right, it's support because she--
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.020]   her anti-bullying efforts.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:41.180]   I mean, Gaga is a whole thing.
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:41.940]   Chrome.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.980]   She does a Chrome commercial.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.380]   So, right, I'm trying to think for somebody like me,
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.980]   what would be-- if there's anything that would be compelling--
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   I mean, I'm too old for a bit to be a band.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.420]   I guess if you were a NFL--
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:02.100]   If you're a fan of the 49ers, there's people who do that.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.820]   But you can't imagine something like this, like,
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.460]   Twit having its own-- I'm not suggesting
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.980]   that Twit build its own social network.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.380]   But you can imagine a personalized site like this for Twit.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.380]   Well, we've got a forum.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.220]   We've had things kind of like this.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.980]   The chat room is that.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:21.380]   Isn't this really just a forum more modern with more media
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.580]   features, but really, ultimately, it's a forum.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:24.020]   Isn't it?
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:24.820]   It's a community.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:25.540]   It's not a forum.
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.220]   Well, a forum is a community.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:27.740]   Forms.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.260]   It's a forum.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.860]   A forum is a tool for a community.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.380]   A community are groups of people.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:32.900]   You have a community--
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.740]   I think Leo is saying it's a forum for the community here.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.740]   Sure.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:42.860]   He's a convener of people who have similar icky interests.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.540]   What is-- I don't even know what our forum is.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.180]   Is it Twit commons?
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.140]   Dot twit.tv?
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.380]   Does anybody know?
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:50.940]   I haven't used it.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:51.540]   I haven't used it.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:51.940]   No, no.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.580]   It's commons.twit.tv.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:56.220]   Let me see.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.380]   No, I don't even know.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.300]   You know, Ben Fransky, our moderator, was here.
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.820]   He said, you guys don't have a link on the front page anymore.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.460]   It's town commons.twit.tv.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.740]   And this actually used to be very active.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.540]   If we made this more Pinterest-y,
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.060]   it would be very similar to what Lady Gaga is doing, right?
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.580]   More Pinterest-y.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.540]   People come here for tech help mostly.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.180]   That's where most of the posts are.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.500]   But we could do this.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:26.380]   We could be more active, certainly, in business.
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:28.900]   Well, and Jeremy's point, if it's truly a community,
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.980]   it doesn't need you.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.940]   It'll live on its own.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.620]   You can add value.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.300]   Well, this does.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.260]   It's got 21,000 registered members.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.540]   It's got 19,000 posts.
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:37.380]   Wow.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.540]   So just about every single person has--
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:43.340]   And it's completely neglected.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:49.300]   I'm sorry to say, I thought foolish me, forums were dead.
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.620]   I thought, oh, nobody uses forums anymore.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.180]   Then then Gaga comes along, and that's really just a forum.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.220]   I'm telling you.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:55.820]   That's what that is.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.180]   That's what that is.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:56.620]   It's reassuring.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:57.420]   I don't think it's a--
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.980]   Yeah, well, it's dressed up.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:04.180]   Yeah, well, what do people do a lot of on forums?
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.020]   Pictures.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:06.820]   Look at-- what is it?
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.980]   B slash B?
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.220]   It's pictures.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:13.100]   Four chance is a forum.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:13.980]   It's pictures.
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:15.180]   Reddit is--
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.620]   Reddit's a forum.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.220]   We're going to do subreddits.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.180]   Oh, cool.
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.020]   For all of our shows, in fact, this show will have a--
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:23.540]   Oh, yes.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:24.180]   --subreddit.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.940]   We just haven't started promoting it.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.780]   When should I start promoting that, Chad?
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.980]   Let me hear back from Greg.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:33.020]   You know what we're looking for for this is eventually
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.660]   we will want community moderators for all of these.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.060]   Absolutely.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:42.060]   So if you love Twig or Twit or Macbreak Weekly, TNT already
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.700]   has a subreddit.
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.980]   We would love it if you'd get-- and you're a Redditor.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.420]   You really end a Reddit, and you know how to use all the stuff.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.620]   We would love to get you involved.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.900]   So just think about that.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.260]   I think these have never gone away, but they are--
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.900]   and so when I look at what Gaga's doing,
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.460]   oh, that's--
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.060]   look, I was a member of the Well in 1984.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:02.900]   Which is for sale?
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.940]   Now for sale, yes.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.860]   Yeah, sad to say.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.940]   Don't you buy it, Leo?
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:07.460]   10 bucks.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:07.860]   That's probably--
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.060]   Don't you buy it.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.420]   How much?
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.620]   Well, because I don't want it.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.820]   What would I do with it?
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:12.540]   It's a text.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.940]   It's a forum.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:17.100]   But the Well, which was kind of the prototypical forum
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:21.340]   in the '80s, mid-80s, started by Stuart Brandt of the Holers
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:21.780]   catalog.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:25.740]   In fact, it stands for Whole Earth Electronic Link.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.820]   It was the first place I experienced the internet.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.740]   You could drop through the bottom of the Well user interface
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:34.780]   to a command line, and then you could run links or gopher
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.620]   or Archie and Veronica.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:39.660]   And that's how I saw the internet the first time.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.580]   So in other words, this has been around for a while.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:47.300]   People don't change just the tools and technology.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.620]   Yeah, it's more visual than it was.
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.140]   It's true.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.220]   This is just more visual, which makes sense for Gaga fans.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.420]   Yeah, we could make ours more visual.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.900]   Somebody should write some Pinterest-style forum software
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.340]   than we'd use it.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:01.020]   Ning is now part of Glam.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:01.420]   Oh, really?
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.180]   I didn't know that.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.460]   And full disclosure is I've been an advisor to Glam,
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.780]   and I'm friendly with them.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.740]   Is Glam like FAB and fancy?
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.500]   What is Glam?
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.300]   Glam is now larger than AOL.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.220]   It has 243 million in the computers.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.540]   Glam Media?
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.260]   Glam Media Glam is basically a network and platform.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.180]   Started for women.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.260]   Now it has men and other topics.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:26.220]   But rather than the old model of the portal
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.940]   or the old model of a content company,
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:31.460]   Glam is an enabling network for a couple thousand sites.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.140]   So this is like Lincoln Park is doing essentially
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.780]   what Gaga's doing.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.540]   Right, so you could use Ning using their platform.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.780]   The Twitter, I'm sure I'll be happy to introduce you to them.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.220]   They have all kinds of great tools for creators now.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:44.860]   That's what they do.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.420]   Hey, Jeff, how do you compare Glam Media to like federated
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.620]   media or other types of influencer networks?
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.220]   Glam-- I mean, yes, it started as an ad network.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.020]   But it has a lot more tools.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:59.380]   So it enables people to create a lot of things.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.180]   And they have very high end ad sales.
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.420]   They only take high end brand ads.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.500]   And again, full disclosure is that I became friendly with Samira
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.020]   Aurora, who's the CEO.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.860]   Because I believe in the network model,
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.740]   and it was pretty much the-- and it still is--
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:18.380]   the only large substantiation of that model at scale.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.660]   Well, what about demand media?
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.500]   No, demand's not a network at all.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.420]   Demand pays people to go write crap.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.460]   This is the opposite the other way around,
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.700]   where you've got content.
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.660]   You're a creator.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.900]   So Dr. Phil is using this, drfil.com.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:36.260]   It looks like a Dr. Phil website.
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.620]   It is its site fully.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:40.620]   What client does is enable them with ad sales,
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.380]   and promotion, and some technology.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.900]   And so it's a network to enable the sites that
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.900]   are on it to succeed.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.420]   So it's a media platform.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:49.780]   It's a media platform with monetization and engagement
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.100]   tools, ready to go.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.220]   Yes.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.380]   There's this new company, Check It Out.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.300]   I just met with them yesterday, a disclosure there,
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.300]   a client now, of this moment.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.740]   And they allow companies to build these types of things
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:03.780]   across social networks and even on HTML pages.
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.780]   So I'm seeing this trend, the white labeling trend,
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.060]   starting to emerge now, too, like this.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:11.940]   So there's going to be a lot of permutations of this.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.860]   So does Glam-- now see, these are kind of cheat
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:18.100]   ads up at the top here.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:19.580]   These look like almost Google ads.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.220]   Glam itself, oh, I see.
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:26.300]   Well, I thought they usually didn't allow you to do that kind
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:26.860]   of stuff.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.020]   They sell just-- as far as I know,
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.220]   they sell just branded ads.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.020]   I don't want to control everything on every site.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.660]   Do you get this site for free, and then you do an ad share
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:37.140]   with Glam?
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.140]   No, they invite you in.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:38.900]   They invite you into the--
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:39.820]   They invite you in.
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:40.940]   So it's selective.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:46.300]   So after spending $100,000 on our Twitch site,
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.540]   I'm starting to think maybe this would have been a smart move.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.900]   And Jeff, how do you think this is different than a branded
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.900]   YouTube experience or a Facebook experience?
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:58.700]   Just because you can control it.
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.340]   Well, it's unique.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.060]   I mean, look at these.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.780]   None of these look like they're brand--
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:04.020]   So it's just-- we're just talking to experience here.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:07.740]   Glam-- here, Jeremiah, the Glam is not a brand.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.140]   And they thought it was going to be originally,
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.140]   but it's really not.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.340]   It's an enabling company behind--
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:12.860]   Infrastructure.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:13.780]   --2000 brands.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.660]   And I notice it doesn't say Glam.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.140]   No.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.580]   Any-- well, here it is at the bottom.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.140]   Glamhealthandwellnessbliss.com.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:22.700]   So they have Bliss, which is health.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:23.420]   They have Glam--
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.420]   So it has a cross link to another Glam site.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.060]   That's it.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.220]   I mean, you wouldn't know this is Glam.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.820]   But what's fascinating-- five years ago, it started.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.380]   And within less than two years, it
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.580]   was larger than I have an alleged, which
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.460]   was the queen of women's sites.
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.500]   And now it's larger than AOL.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:38.140]   That's kind of--
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.380]   --in it by building a network.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.020]   244 million uniques.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:44.380]   It's really-- I'm just shocked that more
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.380]   haven't seen this network.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:49.660]   So if I were a newspaper company, a magazine company,
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.620]   cutting asked or herst or those kind of places,
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.300]   this is what they should have been building.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.980]   They could have a thousand brands.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.380]   And I've said it to all those companies.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:59.180]   But this is a distributed model, traditional media companies.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.500]   And you know that only think centralized
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.460]   and centralized monetization.
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:04.620]   Precisely, Gerald.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:05.540]   Does that mean--
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.860]   So they don't really want to give up any power to Glam?
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.580]   Is that it?
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.060]   You want to hold editorial tight.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:12.860]   You want to hold advertising network tight.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.940]   And yet this relationship would be probably
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.300]   to everyone's benefit.
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.140]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:21.540]   And I think I was operating out of that kind of mistake.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.460]   I've gone to sessions with Glam bloggers,
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.820]   and they don't compete with each other.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.460]   They recognize that ships rise in the tide.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:27.900]   They link to each other.
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.660]   And they all benefit.
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.140]   I did mean to--
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.420]   Can you introduce me to Glam?
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.700]   I'd like to meet them.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.020]   Back.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:34.500]   You bet.
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.980]   Sumira Rora is a great character.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:36.900]   He's in the services square area.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.580]   I think I blew it.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:40.180]   He's an ex-apple exact.
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.820]   Well, you know, we literally spent--
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:45.420]   just spent nearly $100,000 on Twit.tv,
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.140]   and the new tech guy's site, which is about to launch also.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.820]   And it's that centralized model where we have the servers.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:51.340]   We control it.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:55.100]   We spend thousands of dollars a month running it.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.540]   And this would probably make us a hell of a lot more money.
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:26:59.340]   Yeah, but these--
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.260]   No, they'd be out there selling ads for you.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:02.420]   The thing is, these ads--
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:03.660]   We control the ads.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.180]   Right.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.380]   So you would be giving up monetization options
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.500]   in order to reduce maintenance costs.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.060]   For the best--
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:09.460]   So the question of--
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:12.020]   and you make more than $100,000 in your network
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:12.860]   of long-term value.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:13.220]   Yes.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.180]   So the question is, do we join or build?
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.740]   The answer is when do we do it?
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:17.580]   How do we do it?
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.180]   Yes, we do both.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.340]   You're all over the social web, too.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:22.980]   So there's like three levels, right?
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.140]   You have your .com or--
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.260]   I feel like an idiot savant who just stumbled into this world.
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.260]   Come on, no.
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.740]   And I understand any of it.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.860]   And then they get people like you and Jeremiah,
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:36.020]   and they explain this to me, and then I go, oh.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.780]   But you specialize in selling video ads.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:39.780]   And I don't know what I--
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:41.180]   In a certain way.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.740]   The truth is, my only, only, only interest
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:47.540]   is in creating a network that helps people understand
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.140]   technology and hanging out with smart people
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:52.580]   and talking about technology.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.980]   And the only reason we do any monetization or anything else
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.900]   is to subsidize that.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:00.900]   If I could do this and make a--
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.780]   I mean, I don't--
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.740]   But I haven't figured out how to-- I don't know.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:08.580]   What I am is a content guy who's
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:12.260]   kind of trying to thread his way through this new media
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.820]   universe, which is crazy.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:18.340]   Well, I feel like that guy in newsroom.
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.860]   I have a blog.
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.700]   Check the fax machine.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.020]   Where's the fax machine?
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.860]   Check the fax machine.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:29.340]   Well, he's knocked Gina over by accent.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:30.140]   Whoa!
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.620]   Hey.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:34.900]   The woman was embedded in Iraq, in Afghanistan,
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:38.500]   Pulitzer Prize winner, wounded.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.180]   But for some reason, she can't figure out
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:44.740]   that an acronym can't begin with is is is.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.300]   I know.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:47.420]   So maybe people get stupid when they--
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.340]   Oh, god, that acronym is--
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:49.180]   They got on TV.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:52.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.180]   No, Aaron has a deep-rooted hatred for women
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.100]   and for technology.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.900]   It's now become apparent.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.780]   And for-- I would argue populism in democracy.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:02.500]   And democracy.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.980]   Oh, he's absolutely the latest.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.220]   As am I, but I try to hide it.
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.620]   In a good way, me.
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.540]   When me and my buddies get together
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:14.900]   at the Bohemian Grove, we often laugh at new proletarian.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:19.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.660]   Somebody asked me on Twitter, are you going to the Grove?
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:23.380]   I said, what?
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:26.980]   I think they assume that I am a media elite.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:29.980]   Yeah, me and George Schultz were like this.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.860]   Let us take a break.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.540]   I'll tell you what I'm excited about.
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:34.740]   Jeff's going to have a number.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.140]   Gene is going to have a tip.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:37.300]   I'm going to have a tool.
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.300]   Jeremiah, I don't know what.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:40.780]   And just a bit.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:43.460]   But first, I'm going to tell you about how a great little
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:49.340]   company is changing the mobile phone space.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:52.380]   I love this kind of a story.
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:57.180]   Elliot Noss, who heads two cows, does huffer.com, which
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.260]   has really kind of created a new way to do
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.060]   don't have domain registry.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:05.060]   He's trying to do the same thing with Ting.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.220]   I love this.
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:08.580]   The idea is you get billing clarity.
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.500]   You know exactly what you're getting and what you're paying
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:10.780]   for.
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.620]   You get great usability, a great interface,
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.260]   big savings at Ting, ting.ing.com.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.060]   This is a phone company.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.300]   They're on the Sprint network.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.980]   So if Sprint works well for you, then Ting will work great
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:23.700]   for you.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.340]   And I invite you to go to Ting.com/twig and try the
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:28.540]   savings calculator.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:30.700]   So you'll bring your phone bill to that.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.460]   And then you can say what your phone bill is and then compare
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.620]   it to the Ting plans.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.740]   Now here's what I like.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:38.700]   These plans are just serving suggestions.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.180]   And they are no way binding.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:43.460]   So you say, well, but I'll give you an idea of how it works.
[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:46.180]   I'm going to have-- let's say this is a family of four.
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.140]   We've got four phones.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.940]   I'll show you where the phones are in a bit.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:52.180]   And we're going to, as a family, on this plan, use 1,000
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:57.020]   minutes, 4,000 text messages, and 3 gigabytes of data a month.
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:02.140]   And that is a total of, when you add it all up, $113 for
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:02.900]   that family of four.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.140]   Four phones, everything.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:06.100]   Here's the beauty part.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.740]   Use less.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.660]   They give you a rebate.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:08.380]   Use more.
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.500]   They charge you at the same rate.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:12.860]   There's no penalty.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.420]   This is the rate.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:17.300]   You've charged or credited based on your actual usage
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:18.620]   without penalties.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.060]   You get free voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:26.980]   calling, caller ID, tethering, hotspotting, and a
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.500]   lot more.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.700]   It is a brilliant-- this is how it should be.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.420]   Now, let's look at the devices.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.500]   Android, of course, and a good variety of devices, including
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:43.300]   the Samsung Galaxy S2, the 4G, because it's using the
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:46.180]   Sprint 4G network, and other feature phones as well.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.460]   You even have data devices.
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:53.140]   They have the Sierra wireless card 3G or the Huawei Express.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.060]   So you buy these devices.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.460]   You're not paying a subsidized price.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:58.300]   You own it.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.340]   They're unlocked.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.660]   And now you're tingin'.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:04.900]   Ting.com/twig.
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:07.660]   Find out how much you would save right now.
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.140]   I think you'll be very impressed.
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:10.540]   Easy access to your billing information.
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.420]   In fact, there's total-- for businesses, great, because
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:15.180]   you could see exactly how the phones are being used.
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:16.940]   You get complete controls over the features.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:19.500]   There's lots of help content there.
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:22.500]   And you pay for exactly what you use with no premiums and
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.580]   no penalties.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.380]   It's just flat.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:27.540]   I highly recommend it.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.460]   I want you to give it a try.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.620]   They've got-- this is a modern company.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.500]   They're on Twitter.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.660]   They do customer support through Twitter.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:34.860]   Their blog.
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:36.140]   They post release notes.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.300]   It's a bunch of geeks.
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:42.780]   And everything from the Sanio Zio phone and 105 bucks.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.740]   They don't take ducks.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:47.100]   Only bucks to the Motorola Photon 545 bucks and the
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:49.740]   Galaxy S2s in there too.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.700]   I'm sure they'll have the S3 any day now.
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:56.020]   It's ting.com/twig.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:59.180]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:01.580]   Twitter rolled out a couple of changes to their search
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:04.460]   option, which I kind of dig.
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:07.460]   Could you go to Twitter search and you type in, say,
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.180]   you type in Newsroom.
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:13.980]   It will autocomplete for you names and topics.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:15.580]   In your search results, that's pretty cool.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.380]   That's OK.
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.900]   But the thing I think I'm most excited about is that when
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.340]   you're looking at search results, you can see the top
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.740]   tweets or you can see all tweets.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:24.580]   That's always been.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:25.980]   But now there's a new link.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:27.700]   Tweets from people you follow.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.820]   I like that.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:29.820]   I like that a lot.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:33.180]   So now it's not all tweets from people you follow
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.940]   over all time.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:36.420]   It's only like the last week of tweets because Twitter,
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:38.020]   they're not in the archiving business.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.980]   They're in the tweets of the moment business.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.740]   But still really, really useful.
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:43.780]   So if you want to find out what your friends are saying
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.980]   about something that's happening right this minute,
[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:47.740]   really neat new feature.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.820]   People you follow, tweets from people you follow.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.060]   And Twitter search results.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:51.940]   Very cool.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.060]   And I think this has rolled out to the Twitter clients
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.260]   yet on mobile phones.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:57.500]   But I believe that it's supposed to in the coming weeks.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.620]   What do you think of the fact that Twitter has basically
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:03.340]   intimated that the third parties are out?
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:04.980]   Twitter's really making some--
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:07.100]   Dick Costalos makes some big changes right now.
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.620]   Twitter, this is the beginning, this new search.
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:13.660]   But I think there are a lot of people who say, hey, watch it.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.780]   They're off at the start of an article that said,
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:18.380]   Twitter, just remember MySpace and Dig.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.460]   You've got to consider your community.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.260]   You could fit at them in the past, Gina.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:24.460]   I've always tried to push you on the developer view
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.540]   that they're kind of screwing the developers.
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:27.780]   You still defend them?
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:31.500]   Twitter wants developers not to build third party apps.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.700]   They want developers to build into Twitter,
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.940]   like Twitter as a platform.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.140]   So Twitter wants you to be able to expand the tweet
[01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.380]   and see different kinds of content inside that tweet
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.380]   on the Twitter website.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:44.580]   So I think that Twitter's announcements to developers
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.780]   haven't been the best handled.
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.060]   I think that a lot of people have been sort of kind of rightfully
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:51.860]   upset saying, hey, we helped make this platform what it is
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:54.900]   and now you're telling us to back off and stop making clients.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:57.500]   But they didn't really say anything.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.060]   They said stop making clients a year ago
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:03.100]   and said start kind of doing, innovating,
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.340]   doing things that we can't do.
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:06.820]   Something doing new stuff.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:09.300]   But then they turned off LinkedIn.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.100]   Well, right.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:12.900]   And then they said, we're going to have stricter guidelines.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.540]   And they launched that Twitter card feature.
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.380]   They say, they say, don't recreate the experience
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.500]   that you get on the Twitter website.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.420]   So don't show your home timeline, which
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.580]   is what LinkedIn was doing.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.780]   They were showing that you're--
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:26.900]   So I'm not strongly defending Twitter.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:29.060]   I'm not completely offended in turn.
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:31.340]   I'm cautiously optimistic that Twitter
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.220]   is encouraging innovation in new areas.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:38.620]   When they turn off think up, I'll change my tune.
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.620]   And this is what it seems to be coming down to.
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.060]   There are many of us-- and I'm sure you're in this camp-- who
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:48.140]   think of Twitter as the dial tone, as the carrier,
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.340]   as the signal.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:51.180]   And Twitter, apparently increasingly,
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:53.020]   is considering itself as a content company.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.660]   Yeah, Twitter decided--
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:56.140]   Twitter is not the pipes, right?
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.660]   They want to be the media company.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:00.700]   Except that it's our content that we made
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.700]   that we're putting on Twitter.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.180]   But you get to use it for free.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.180]   That's why they say that.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.180]   So the product they launched was the Twitter card,
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:09.220]   which is taking the media elements, the whole tweet,
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.180]   and the embedded media, maybe even your videos
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.500]   and pictures, Leo.
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.180]   And that can be embedded other places.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:16.820]   So they are building media features.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.980]   This is part of the game.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.620]   Then obviously, what happens on top of that
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:22.420]   is potential advertising.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.180]   So Twitter cards are like kind of longer posts,
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.180]   but they can contain media experiences.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.460]   So you put HTML in your web pages.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:35.900]   And then when somebody tweets a link to your content,
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:40.780]   the card comes from your page onto the tweet.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.180]   The content that you tweeted about
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.260]   appears in the card as I understand it.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:44.940]   So it's like--
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.780]   And then the other--
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:49.020]   Here's an example from the Twitter developer site.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.340]   So Richard Henry, as an example, said,
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.100]   there's a whole lot of people and then posted a link
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.420]   to the New York Times.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:57.660]   And then what you get on the Twitter website--
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.980]   and presumably at some point on--
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:36:59.660]   In your site.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.260]   Twitter clients is a--
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.340]   kind of a news reader synopsis with an image.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.300]   Yeah, I mean, Twitter has to compete with Facebook
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:11.340]   and Google+, which supports rich media inside posts.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.540]   And you can see this now.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.420]   Right now, if you look at a tweet with an Instagram link
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.220]   or a Flickr link, if you expand that tweet on the Twitter
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:19.220]   website, it will show you the image in line.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.220]   And they want to expand that to include different kinds
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:22.980]   of content.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.980]   That's one more thing that I got to do.
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:27.540]   I got to send a note.
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.460]   Now, our developers, I--
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:33.220]   Yeah, and say, hey, what are we doing about this?
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.420]   Likely it's the same markup that would work on Facebook
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.740]   and Google+, Leo.
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:40.980]   So it should be too expensive for you.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.220]   OK, Glenn, you're going to get an email.
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.180]   Right, it's hard to keep up with all of this stuff.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:49.180]   Thank you, Gina, for banning Twitter search.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:49.660]   Take a look.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:52.580]   Our number of the week.
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:58.340]   22%, Megan Garber wrote a piece on Atlantic online
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:01.540]   and said that a researcher named Matthew Burke
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:06.180]   found that 22% of web pages contain Facebook URLs.
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.340]   Wow.
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:08.460]   Which is pretty amazing.
[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.460]   I don't get the numbers.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:13.380]   Because it then says the $242 million of $1.3 billion.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.740]   And I would think there'd be more than the number of pages.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:20.380]   But in any case, that means that Facebook
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:25.460]   has managed to embed itself into the web.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:29.340]   Then it says that there are 7.5% of websites
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:33.580]   he analyzed use Facebook's open graph tags in their pages.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.380]   So when it comes to signal generation,
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:37.820]   when it comes to understanding the web
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:39.900]   and understanding more about it, one
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.780]   starts to wonder who understands not just people better,
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.740]   but the web better, Google or Facebook.
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:47.780]   They've managed to provide functionality
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.820]   that sites are using.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:51.900]   They've liked the fact that people
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.700]   are linking to their friends' stuff.
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.580]   They're linking to their own stuff.
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:58.820]   All of those things did the sign-in structure.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:02.380]   All of those things start to make tentacles for Facebook
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:05.860]   out into the world of the web.
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:08.980]   I wonder how this compares to Google Analytics code.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:10.420]   I'm really curious too.
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.780]   And one thing I don't understand about this
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:15.220]   is it says that there are more than 471 million total Facebook
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:16.060]   URLs.
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.940]   Well, there's more Facebook people than that.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.420]   There's more Facebook stuff than that.
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.620]   So I don't understand that.
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:27.300]   And then he says of 500 hard-coded links to Facebook,
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.460]   writes Megan, only 3.5 or 0.7% are unique.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.580]   I don't understand that either.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.820]   So I don't really get this.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:34.900]   Often, don't.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:36.500]   I say these things.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:37.700]   But I thought I'd throw it out there
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:41.060]   because I found it interesting at least.
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:44.820]   My tool is something I found as usual in Life Hacker.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.500]   They are so good at Android stuff.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:48.540]   I'm so jealous.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:51.220]   I don't have jelly beans, so I don't have Google Now.
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:52.380]   And I really want Google Now.
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.140]   That looks despite the creepy factor we talked about.
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:56.500]   Looks great because it kind of knows
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.180]   what you're interested in and it's supply.
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.380]   Have you been using now?
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:39:59.860]   Nope.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.300]   You use an iPhone.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:05.740]   Well, maybe someday I'll get jelly bean on one of my phones.
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:10.860]   Meanwhile, I'm using something called Bounce GPS Calendar Beta.
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:13.660]   This is a very interesting idea.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:17.140]   You know, the kids say, I know this because I have a kid.
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:19.140]   When they want to leave, they go, let's bounce.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:20.940]   We're bouncing out of here.
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.060]   Do you ever say that, Gina?
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:24.980]   I'm actually a little too old for that one.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.140]   Yeah, I'm going to bounce.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:26.980]   I know what it means.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:28.420]   You've heard people say I'm going to bounce.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.540]   Let's bounce.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:31.700]   So here's my problem.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.580]   I'm always late for everything, as you may have noticed.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.780]   I'm late right now.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:38.060]   We were supposed to start triangulation eight minutes ago.
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:38.620]   That's OK.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.620]   We're going to any minute now.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.140]   No one Bushnell will be on this set.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:42.900]   But I know Nicole.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:45.220]   So this is why you're going to like it that I got this program,
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:46.820]   except it doesn't help with this.
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:50.940]   Bounce knows where you are, knows where you're going from your calendar,
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.260]   and lets you know ahead of time.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:56.140]   It's time to leave if you want to get there on time.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:57.580]   Is that wild?
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:58.500]   That's cool.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:01.740]   So it uses Google Calendar or Microsoft Exchange,
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:04.540]   provides a reminder before you need to leave.
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.620]   You can configure it.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:08.380]   So I can say, let me know 30 minutes for each trip,
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:14.020]   add 10 minutes to my travel time, or less or more.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:14.980]   It runs in the background.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.100]   It doesn't have really much of an interface.
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:18.780]   But what you'll want to do on your calendar
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.780]   is put addresses for all of your stuff,
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:23.700]   and then bounce will tell you 10 minutes before you have
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:24.340]   to be somewhere.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:26.660]   You've got to leave now.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:27.740]   Wild app.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:30.540]   It's free, and they say it's going to receive frequent updates
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:33.100]   that eventually they want to--
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:36.380]   this is one of the features of Google now, appointment reminders.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.620]   But eventually they're going to do a lot more.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:41.780]   It does use your GPS, your calendar, and by the way,
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:47.780]   it checks traffic data so that it will add some time if the traffic is bad.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.980]   Now, unfortunately, my commute is just to the other side of the studio.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:51.500]   So--
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:54.500]   Oh, [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.420]   Not going to be much alpha.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:58.420]   What do I do for you?
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:00.300]   An hour and a half, really, Jeff?
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:01.060]   Been a mama.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:01.580]   Wow.
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:02.260]   Been a mama.
[01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:03.500]   Gosh.
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.180]   And that's so you can live in the country?
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.740]   The kids got addicted to oxygen.
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:08.260]   What can I say?
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:09.860]   Damn.
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:13.780]   When they grow out of that, are you going to move back to the city?
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.620]   Then I got my wife got addicted to it, too.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:18.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:19.460]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:20.260]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.860]   Great to have you, Jeff Jarvis, is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.820]   That's his blog where he writes, and he
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:27.060]   made an extra effort to be here for the show today.
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:27.420]   Thank you.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:28.460]   I really appreciate that.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.380]   Very grateful.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.140]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:34.700]   And of course, she writes, "Think Up," the amazing Twitter
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:35.980]   application.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.060]   And with any luck, she'll continue
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:42.020]   to be able to do that for years to come and think up app.com.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.220]   Great to be here.
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:44.140]   So good to see you guys.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.300]   It's going to be back, isn't it?
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:45.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:46.500]   Yeah, great to be back.
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.420]   Yay.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.820]   And thanks to Jeremiah.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.260]   Oh, yang.
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:52.420]   For bringing all his Google I/O swag.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:53.100]   My pleasure.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:53.740]   Thanks for having me.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.940]   What is this, a clier?
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.940]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:56.980]   I dug up that much.
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:57.340]   Totally.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.660]   I've seen it at my closet.
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:00.180]   And it's got Palm OS on it.
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:01.020]   I didn't even know how to--
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:01.540]   If I can charge it.
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:03.420]   This was my favorite Palm device, actually,
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.700]   then Sony got out of the business.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.380]   But this was a great--
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.100]   That's before the touch really worked,
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.740]   and you'd actually have to use a stylist.
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:10.860]   To use a stylist.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.580]   And in fact, I had a--
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:15.420]   I lent this to a friend, and I got it back,
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:16.540]   and it was all scratched up.
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.740]   And I said, what happened?
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:22.180]   She said, I was playing bejeweled.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.740]   And there were lines in the grid of bejeweled all the way
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:26.300]   all over it.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:29.540]   But so somewhere I have a scratched up Sony clier.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.500]   You brought some fun stuff for us here.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.180]   We've come a long way, baby.
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:37.820]   You could find Jeremiah everywhere at Jo Yang, right?
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.660]   J-O-Y--
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:44.980]   J-O-W-Y-A-N-G, or at web-strategists.com.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:45.780]   Good to see you.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:46.340]   Thanks, man.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:46.940]   That shirt.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:47.860]   Awesome.
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:48.860]   Buzz shirt.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:50.580]   That's not a-- ooh, is that a--
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.820]   that's not one of those watches.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.020]   Now this is not the pebble.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.220]   This is a Nixon.
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:54.900]   Oh, cool.
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.620]   I like Nixon.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:57.140]   Those are skater watches.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:58.420]   Thanks, everybody, for being here.
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.140]   We do this week in Google when Leo shows up.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.140]   1 o'clock Pacific, 4 p.m.
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:07.860]   Eastern time, 2000 UTC on Wednesdays.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.620]   But you can always get the on-demand version
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:12.420]   after the fact of Twit.tv or wherever finer podcasts
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:13.340]   are aggregated.
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:14.820]   Stay tuned.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.980]   In just a minute, as soon as I walk over,
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.380]   we're going to get Nolan Bushnell on triangulation.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.380]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:23.540]   We'll see you next week on Twit.
[01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:26.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:30.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.840]   (upbeat music)
