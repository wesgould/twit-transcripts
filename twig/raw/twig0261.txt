[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.700]   We'll talk about a great trip to Sicily. We didn't get invited to.
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.900]   And Wikipedia links are now being taken down by the European right to be forgotten. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   It's time for Twig this weekend in Google. I'm Leo Laporte and joining me as always, if we can help it,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   the great Gina Trapani, founding editor of Life Hacker and the author of the Think Up App at ThinkUp.com.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   Hi, Gina. Hi, how are you? Great to see you. Welcome.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Here's my big phone. We're going to talk about it. We're going to talk about the big phone.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Because as usual, we have to talk Jeff Jarvis down off the ledge. Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   He is. There's his Osborne 1 over his right shoulder there, or left shoulder.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   He's still using that. That's how far behind me.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Also the author of public parts. What would Google do? Blogger@buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   So we were hoping, we talked last week, that for the first time ever, all three hosts of this week in Google would be using the same phone.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   And Jeff has ruined... No, he isn't.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   So we're talking about the 1+1, which no one can get.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   It's still in very, very short supply. You have to either get an invite. By the way, don't ask me. I don't have any. I didn't get any.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   We both, in fact, all three of us, they got it from friendly listeners.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   And so they have the invites, not us.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   This 1+1 is from 1plus.net. They call it the flagship killer.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   And we've all... Gina and I anyway have been very impressed with it.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Especially because the 64 gig model, which is the one we recommend, is only 350 bucks.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   Unlocked. Yeah. Yeah, it's great.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   So, and in every respect, it is a top of the line phone, Snapdragon 801 processor, three gigs of RAM. Very few phones have that.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   64 gigs of storage, 13 megapixel camera. We find quite good.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   A very nice 1080p display at 5.5 inches. This is a... They call it a flagship killer. I'd agree.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   It's a unbelievable price, but you have to get an invite or you have to play a game to get it.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   Or you have to have nice listeners, which is what you have. Thank you very much listeners.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Yeah, thank you listeners. Guys are awesome.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Jeff, who is currently using an XS5, is reluctant. What... From what stems your reluctance?
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   Well, a little bit was actually your talk last week. I was feeling a little bit...
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   I'm a little bit a little bit used here.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   Yeah, I... It's a marketing gimmick. It is absolutely that.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   That I went on and then...
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   Deflated my bubble.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   Because I was... We'll go into my printer situation in a minute, but I returned to printer this week and I returned something else.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   So I was looking at it and I said, "Hmm." And I went on to their service area and they basically said, "Oh, we're too busy to give much service. Look."
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   And I asked for an RMA now, I think, four days ago, and I haven't heard the board back yet.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   So, I thought, "You're not going to get any service on this thing at all."
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   I think that's the case. I think you shouldn't expect that if something breaks, you can send it back to them.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   And then you get a new one.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   And so I thought Gina was going to open hers and why not let Mikey eat it?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   And I'd see what she thought.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   So if Gina was happy and if Gina knowing how neurotic I can be and what I'm paying, I can be,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   knowing that I now know where to find her and I can show up on her doorstep and say, "Make this work for me."
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   That she would have to give me good advice and say, "Open it up."
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Oh, man. Put this on me. Put this on me.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   But you made a good point, Jeff.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   The real question is in the context of coming from a Nexus 5.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   Yes.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   I mean, if you were coming from a Galaxy S, I'd say yes.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   But Nexus 5, that's a little bit more challenging.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   Oh, you're playing with me, right?
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   Yeah, messing with me.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   You know my neurosis, don't you?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   Well, the Nexus 5 is a really great phone.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   Really great phone.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   And that's part of it, too, is that I feel a little profligate saying,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   "I have a... How many people in the world would love to have this phone?"
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   And here I am going to buy another phone.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.600]   What are you going to say to the starving people in China?
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   I mean, this came from the starving people in China.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   They didn't want it.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   Well, that's the other way, by the way.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Maybe it's something about the Chinese government because it's going to spy on all of us.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   Yeah, the real thing I think I was unfair last week when I really called...
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   I said I called shenanigans.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   By the way, I just accidentally...
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   You just turned on your phone?
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   Turn on my flashlight.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   It's just by doing a V, I think.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   Let me untouch you.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   Is it L or is it B?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   No, it's just a backwards V.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   So I think that was unfair.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   And we talked about it again on Twitter.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   And the consensus, I think, of the tech journalist community is the reason it's so hard to get this is they just can't...
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   They are a small company and they just can't make them very fast.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   There was a tear down from I supply that said it probably costs around $200 to make.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   So maybe it is doable that you can make a $350 flagship killer.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   Maybe that's not...
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   I was guessing that they were priced up.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   That this was below cost.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   They haven't done any marketing.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Yeah, they said it had some plan to somehow send you over to the op-off.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   No.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   But you raised a really good point, which is...
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   It is what the thing that is clear is it's too small to offer any support of any kind.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   But I think when you buy a $350 phone, that's kind of it, right?
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   You understand it.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.600]   Oh, I mean, I forget I have a $350 phone right here.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   I don't get a support on it.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   So before I let GSA, I must say one more thing, which is that Nexus 5 is a great phone except for two...
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   I think two things.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   One, doesn't have a removable battery.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   So, you know, the back is sealed.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Two, its camera is okay at best.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   Now, let's...
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   So you would agree both of those things are negatives.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Size is good.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   It's a 5-inch.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   The battery in that is not wildly removable.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   It's not like I can carry around the battery.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   This is a removable ether.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   This is not removable.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   But it has really insanely good battery life.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   So that becomes less...
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   Very good battery.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   That's moot.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   That's important.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   What are you getting, Gina?
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   The battery life is great.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   I forgot to plug it in the other night.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   Normally, you know, I got to the habit where I had...
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   If I hadn't plugged my phone in overnight, I was basically a so well the next day.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   Right.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   And it was fine.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   It took me through to lunch the next day.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   So I've been getting great battery life.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   I've been really impressed with it.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   I use the G-Sam battery monitor to kind of assess this because I think the only way to
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   know it is to use it for like a week or so.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   And G-Sam keeps all the stats.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   And it's on...
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   So G-Sam was telling me on my HTC One MA that I was getting, 16 hours.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   This says almost 19 hours.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   And I would say that's about right, about almost 20 hours battery life.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   I'd say that's about right.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   And I use it like crazy.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   I mean, we started to talk about this a little bit in the pre-show and my advice to Jeff...
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   Well, first, the whole like I have an XS5, should I really have this other phone?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   You got to get rid of that guilt because the way that I look at it is I feel the same way.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   I'm privileged.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   I'm surrounded by amazing devices.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   But we're doing a service to our listeners if we're doing our jobs right.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   And we cover Android and we cover Google.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   So you kind of have to get over that.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   And you can always donate your Nexus 5 if that happens.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.600]   No, no Twitter friends.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   No Twitter friends.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   Don't line up.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   I can go on.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   I've got a whole lot of them.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   Don't line up.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   Stop asking me.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   All right.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   But, okay.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   So the hardware is awesome.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   The camera alone, I think, is a great reason to switch to the OnePlus.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   The hardware is amazing.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   The screen is huge.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   The phone is so big that I can no longer put this in the front, my front jeans pocket, which
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   if you don't do that, not a big deal, but it just pops.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   It just sticks out too much.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   So if that size matters to you, it might be too big for you.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   But if you've got big hands and you put it in your front shirt pocket, that should be fine.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   It's super thin.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   The screen is beautiful.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   And so the hardware alone, I think, is worth switching.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   The software, Cyanogen, is really great.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.120]   And I was saying to Leo that at first, I felt a little bit like a stranger in a strange
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   land.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.600]   I haven't used Cyanogen in a long time.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.600]   It's not hugely different.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.240]   But there are a few extra settings, which I've had to sort of play around with a little
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.520]   bit to get used to them.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.360]   That might throw you off a little bit at first.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   So, too, just to--
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.000]   But I think once you've got your launcher and your Google Apps, you'll feel right at
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.120]   home the same way you feel on your Nexus 5.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.480]   Just to explain a little bit about that, because people may not be familiar with what's
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.840]   going on here.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.920]   You know, Samsung has touchwiz, HTC has sense.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.280]   Those are skins they put on top of the standard Google Android interface.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.360]   The Nexus 5 is the standard Google Nexus interface.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   Android interface.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's pure.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.720]   So Cyanogen does-- I mean, OnePlus did something interesting.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:37.640]   And they went to a third party Android that has traditionally been used as a replacement
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.240]   from-- people would root their phone and replace the firmware on their Samsung or HTC with
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.480]   Cyanogen mod.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.880]   And it's an enthusiast version of Android.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.120]   So it had traditionally a lot of quirks and weird things.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.240]   Also had problems with not being perfect, because it was always at aftermarket something.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.280]   Hackers had to get the phone and try to make it work and so forth.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.360]   But it does have the advantage of having all the Google Apps at Google services and being
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.960]   a hacker response to ugly skins.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.920]   This version of Cyanogen, which is designed specifically for the one, is much cleaner
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.720]   than the ones I've used in the past.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   And totally reliable GPS works.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   Camera works.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.960]   All the things that sometimes could be finicky on Cyanogen are working fine.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.440]   So this is merely what OnePlus did.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.120]   And I'm sure they funded it and then I'm sure they gave them phones and they worked with
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.640]   them to make sure it all worked perfectly.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.320]   So it is-- even if you've had an experience with Cyanogen, it's not like the one you put
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.640]   on your Galaxy S3, right?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   Right.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:44.360]   And Cyanogen, while it offers themes and skins, Cyanogen itself is a build of Android that
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.840]   changes or exposes.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.160]   I would say exposes some settings in Android that Google's chosen to hide.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.880]   So it makes Android a little bit more configurable.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.040]   So for example, in Cyanogen, the auto rotate button, you can say, lock my rotation on my
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   phone.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   This is built into Android.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.600]   You'll see it on tablets, but it's disabled on phones.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.280]   Google's decided that this doesn't really matter on phones, but Cyanogen decided, hey,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.920]   let's expose this on phones.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.560]   I happen to find that really useful.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.080]   I like to be able to turn on YouTube, lock my rotation and hand it to my daughter and
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.960]   it won't switch around when she moves the phone.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   And so those are the kinds of customizations you'll see with Cyanogen.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   It's not just a skin.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.600]   It feels like a little bit more functionality.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.000]   Do I lose anything or I keep Google now and all that?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.560]   Oh, yeah, all that's the same.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   All that's the same.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   All the Google Apps ship with it.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   I was running the now launcher on my M8 and on my Nexus.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.600]   You can run that on this as well.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   In fact, I would recommend that.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   I would recommend that.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   It's got the whole thing.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.800]   The stock launcher that ships with Trebuchet is very bare bones.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.120]   It really lacks some things that I've, but I've always used third party launchers.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.200]   So Google now is now available for it.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.800]   In fact, it's available for all phones besides not just an access.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   So it's going to be the same launcher you're using right now, Jeff.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   All right.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.000]   I know where to find you, Gina Caprandi.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.400]   I'm scared, but I think you're going to like it.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.760]   Be prepared for that inevitable feeling of being a little bit jarred at the beginning
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   of using something new.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.280]   But keep it open mind the first couple of days and I think you'll really like it.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.880]   And at least back to me out here.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.080]   I am, although he doesn't care what I think.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   I do.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.400]   No, no, no, let's face it.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.600]   He assumes that I just get new phones every month for the joy of it.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.160]   Well, you do.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.080]   I mean, I'm like Leo, it was how at the end of the window show you're saying, you know,
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.440]   I should use this more.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.000]   That 1520 is like no key 50.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's a great.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You're like a psych up to those audience.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   I am not.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   That's sincere.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And I say it here too.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.160]   It's a great phone and I'll say the same thing.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.240]   I said there the apps, the app store is what keeps me from using it.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.600]   It's like, and in fact, I even said that I don't have Google now.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.400]   I don't have Google search.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.120]   I don't have, you know, I don't have Google Maps.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.720]   And that's what keeps me from using it.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.320]   But it is in every respect a wonderful, highly recommended phone, the 1520.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   This is a good phone.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.720]   Jeff, open the box for crying out loud.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.400]   The only thing I think that Jeff makes a very good point is there will be no support.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   No, not some more.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.160]   But guaranteed updates for two years.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.120]   They'll go to the L word as soon as possible.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.360]   Well, that's going to be that.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   Well, it's one disadvantage.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.080]   You're going to wait 90 days past the Nexus 5.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.640]   Yeah, because they have to say anything.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.080]   Yeah, you'll wait because they do have to they have to rebuild, re-cyonogen it.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   It's true.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   That's true.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   That is a little disadvantage.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   All right.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   Better.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   Okay.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.760]   So what does she what does he get that's better?
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.720]   Better camera for sure.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.880]   Bigger screen.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.160]   That could be a pro or a con actually.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.240]   It's not that much bigger.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.960]   It's half an inch bigger.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   Better battery.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   Better battery life.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.480]   Oh, the better battery is actually you know what?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   That's the reason.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.880]   What are you getting on your Nexus 5?
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.800]   Oh, I get through the whole day.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   Do you?
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   No problem.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.400]   Unless I literally weighs on and that just sucks it down.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.520]   Because that's to me that would be the deciding factor for me.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.360]   I did not get a full day on the Nexus 5.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.320]   I would have to charge it at seven or eight o'clock at night.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320]   I want to get 60.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   I have to get 16 hours.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.640]   I want to get it from the moment I get up to the moment I go back to bed.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   So a little bit more functionality.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.680]   Things like tapping the home screen and it lights up.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.360]   So you're not searching for the power.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.160]   That's good.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.960]   Things like the torch.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   Right?
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   I mean, that's just, you know, you can get in an app.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.640]   You can put that Tesla has a widget.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.280]   I have that on my phone.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.640]   But it's built in and the things like that, you know, that auto rotate that I talked about.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.440]   Jeff, what carrier are you on?
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   AT&T.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   Because this will not work on Verizon.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   No, do you think I'm on Verizon?
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.640]   If the device you shipped is broken, says, "F" and "Done," what are you going to do?
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.840]   You can't wait too long because you won't be able to return it.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.160]   Well, no, I already asked for the RMA.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   Ah, smart man.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   Well, I have a common one.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   He's thinking.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.960]   Well, but you're walking started.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.480]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   I love it.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.480]   I like it much more than I thought I would.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.480]   All right, good.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.720]   So I was in return mode because I got a, in my Mac-less PCless world, I got a brother
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.280]   printer that supposedly was going to work on Google Cloud Print.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   But not directly, only basically if you had a machine and even the wonderful Antronix
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.800]   machine is down on the list of approved ones.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.120]   It was yada, yada, yada, yada.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.680]   Oh, you have the Antronix.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.960]   You have the X-print server?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   I have the one.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   Well, it should just work.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.800]   Well, that's maybe I'm screwing it up.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.000]   Gina, come to New Jersey.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I think it should.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   That should just work.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.600]   Well, it works, but they have a list of approved.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.800]   But I also want to be pure.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.360]   So the last one, I want to be pure.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.520]   I wanted to figure this out.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:14.720]   So a nice person on Twitter, a Twig fan, recommended a not a cat, absent.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.280]   So I have an absent one, which I'm told just now I tried to print it home and it wasn't
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280]   working.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   It was off.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   So the Antronix is on right now.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.200]   It'll print through when it's available.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   But the absent should work.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.920]   But the other thing about the nice thing about the absent is the absent will scan to
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   drive.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.920]   Oh, very nice.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   That's a big deal.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.440]   That's a big deal because scanning is a pain in the butt.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.280]   So if that works, if I can keep that working, then that's why then I'm, except for Skype,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   I'm done.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.280]   Skype happens on this.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.240]   Also to be clear because the people in the chatroom are asking this, you can't get this
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   from a carrier.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.320]   You can only get it from OnePlus.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.480]   It's a GSM phone.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.120]   So we'll work in the US on AT&T and T-Mobile.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.840]   I just put my AT&T sim in and it just worked.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.560]   Did you just put your T-Mobile sim in?
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.840]   Gina, it just worked.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.320]   I had to switch to, I had a nano for the M8.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.440]   So I had to switch to micro.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.400]   So I went to the T-Mobile store and the T-Mobile guy nearly died when he saw it.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.760]   What do you saw on the phone?
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.760]   That's a nice feeling.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.640]   He's like, "What phone is that?"
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   And I said, "The one place?"
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.320]   He's like, "I thought so, but I haven't seen him in person."
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.360]   I enjoy trolling the people of folks.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.120]   And yeah, and he just switched out my sim and I popped it in.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   That's awesome.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.880]   And I bought a sim, even though it turns out I didn't need it, I bought a sim conversion
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.880]   thing from the M8.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.440]   Yeah, it'll work with a micro sim, which is still the most common kind.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.840]   Although, I have a number of nano sim phones.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.200]   Apple started this thing and people resisted it, but they won.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.320]   So a lot of phones have nano sims, but you have a micro on your 5, so you're good.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.760]   All right, I'm doing it.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.840]   By the way, a number of people are talking about the LG G3 is the killer phone because
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.800]   it's ultra high def screen.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.960]   But a lot of people are reporting poor battery life and sluggish performance because it's
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.160]   an ultra high def screen.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.680]   And I don't think you gain anything from having UHD on your phone.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:16.400]   So while the G3 looks good in so many respects, that might not be a good choice if battery
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.840]   life are important to you.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.120]   This is snappy and 20 hours.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   Come on.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120]   Well, you know what's going to happen?
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.040]   The day I open it up, they're going to announce the Nexus 6.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.360]   Well, that's what I'm going to start with.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   That's a given.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   That's a given.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   Seriously, that's what I'm worried about.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.560]   The Nexus 6 is going to get announced and you're going to hate me.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.640]   You don't care if the Moto X plus one comes out because you want a pure experience.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   I think so.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.520]   See, I probably will give this to somebody when the Moto X plus one comes out because
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.560]   I love that always listening.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.520]   That the stuff I want that I do want that's why I could have sworn that existed on this
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.240]   thing.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.040]   Only if you there's home screen, but all Google phones now do that.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.960]   You could say, OK, Google on the home screen.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.440]   I don't know if there's any way to wake it up other than that.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   There's special hard that's special hardware on the M7.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.240]   Always on voice to the next one.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.960]   Wait a second.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.320]   One plus is apparently let them for him users choose.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.400]   Hold on darn it.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.240]   I don't want your ad.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.120]   Choose the voice based hot word that will wake up the phone.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.000]   The available choices include OK, one plus wake up one plus.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.360]   I have not seen that in this.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   I don't know.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.080]   That might be a March 12 story.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.240]   Yeah, that was some early pre release version that maybe they didn't leave that in.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.880]   Hmm.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.720]   Hmm.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.600]   The nice thing is you.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.440]   Apps like special apps you get with Sanogen model.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.680]   You do get voice plus and there's some privacy settings that I'm sure that Jeff is not interested
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   in.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.840]   By the way, that is the chief advantage of this to people who don't want Google to
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.040]   know what's going on is that Sanogen is very much privacy focused.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.440]   Of course, the Chinese government may know everything you're doing.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:12.120]   But yeah, you can basically you can block apps from getting access to the personal data,
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.320]   even if you've granted them permission to access that personal data in the Play Store.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.960]   I'm not really sure how this works.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   But from what I can see, yeah, so I clicked on Amazon and it just prevents the app from
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.000]   reading your contacts or looking at your photos or your location, which is just right
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.840]   and it's really interesting or it may or or or you can set it to ask you or just flat
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.160]   out deny it every time.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.920]   It's extremely granular privacy controls.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.040]   Hey, try snap dragon.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.240]   Hey snap dragon.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.720]   No.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:53.120]   And you're saying with the phone off.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.560]   I think you would disable that if it did have that because that's going to be a battery
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   killer here.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.280]   Hey, I'm an idiot.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.200]   No, still doesn't wake up squirrel.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.120]   I'm sure that you've taken out a deep.com.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.360]   I hate it when they put it in the video.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.320]   You got to watch it forever.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.640]   So while Jeff watches a video, let's say thank you to friends at squarespace.com, Gina,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.120]   I presume that you talk all about this on all about Android, right?
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   We did.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.520]   We did talk about it quite a bit.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.000]   Yeah, it's a bit.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.680]   Jason, Jason did the canonical review.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.880]   I think he did it before I died.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.160]   I stole his.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   This is his.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.440]   Well, okay.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.200]   I feel really guilty about this.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.440]   And so here's my I did give him the Google Glass.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   You did.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.640]   In both cases, I paid for it.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.400]   I paid for this and I paid for the Google Glass.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.800]   So they technically are mine, but it was somebody who contacted him to say, Hey, I got a one.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.920]   Would you like it for review?
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.600]   We let him review the voice wake up feature.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.040]   Voice wake up feature voice wake up feature.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.800]   Turn that on.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.240]   Then you can train.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.360]   I'll let Gina do that because I have to do an app.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.880]   So I feel a little guilty, but then, but I, but I asked, I said, Jason, you're going
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   to vacation.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.880]   You totally can take this with you.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   So no, I got an X is five.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   It's okay.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   I said, this can be.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   I don't want to take it away.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.240]   So no, no, it's fine.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   But I think he was being nice.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.120]   Oh, it doesn't sound like Jason, but it's okay, Leo.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   It's okay.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   Here's okay.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.880]   So as soon as the Moto X plus one comes out, I'm giving this back.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.560]   It's it's it's it's oh, I see.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   I see.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.560]   Okay.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.560]   So that's which is real now.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.720]   It's not that crazy about this.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.560]   No, I love this phone.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.040]   The only thing it's missing.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   And maybe you've just solved that.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.080]   I want to try it is the is the fact that it's always I love.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   It's always for me.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.520]   I love the fact there's a few things the Moto X does that no other phone does.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   It knows when you're driving.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   It knows when you're awake.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.560]   It knows when you're in a meeting.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.960]   It does a lot of now I have this agent app that does much of the same thing, but not
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   exactly.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.680]   I love the thing where the pulses and it shows you your text message.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.880]   There's just things it does.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.760]   Oh, I hear Google now launching.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.040]   They're just things it does that I that I really like.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.440]   And it does it because it has dedicated hardware that sips at power while it's waiting for
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.560]   all this stuff to happen.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.000]   And it has an OLED screen that you can just light a little bit of it.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.200]   So it does it without damage, you know, hurting the battery life.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.440]   So I just I'm excited about the next generation of Moto X.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.920]   I'm putting this video on the rundown under other.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   Okay.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   Well, so we wait.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.600]   I have to watch a video in order to figure out how to find this voice thing.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   This is the thing about the energy mod.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.080]   Is it you'll find yourself.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.200]   I'm putting it under genius.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   Okay.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.040]   You do find yourself googling like how do I disable voice?
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.120]   The chat room has put a thread from the OnePlus forms.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.320]   You know, that is probably where you're going to be worth bookmarking the OnePlus net forms
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:06.520]   because probably that's where a lot of this kind of information is going to end up not
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.320]   from one plus staff.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.800]   It says initially we plan to release okay one plus at the end of June to early July.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.640]   We've collected okay one plus recordings from our fans and attempt for the project to be
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   a community effort.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.360]   Cyanogen even set up a studio at their office and people come in to record the phrase blah,
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.440]   blah, blah.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.080]   They haven't done it yet.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.800]   I'm disappointed to say the release date for this feature has been pushed back.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.920]   So this is something you'll get later in an update, Jeff.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.000]   We've now started working with a recording company to redo the recordings professionally.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.280]   There's no new set release date, but look for the okay one plus feature on future updates
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.480]   in a month or two.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.440]   So that's the problem with a lot of the reviews of the one plus were with pre release hardware.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.940]   Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.940]   ah.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.440]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at squarespace.com.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.640]   It's a great place to build your next website, maybe your first website.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   Actually, I envy you if it's your first website because you saved a lot of pain.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.160]   What's great about squarespace?
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.200]   They do the hosting and the software.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   Very tightly integrated.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.120]   That means you cannot bring a squarespace site down, but even better than that, it is
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:18.880]   going to give you state of the art top of the line, ah, web design.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:25.120]   And I got to tell you, web design technologies change faster than almost anything.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.920]   So the ability for instance to have a great site that looks great, that matches your aesthetic,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.600]   your taste, and is mobile responsive, looks good, equally good on a big page or a little
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.800]   screen is huge.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.320]   Each template, they're very visual.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.960]   They do, they really have that kind of that state of the art feel to them.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.120]   The designs of course are your starting point, but it's very easy to modify the page to match
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.600]   your ethos just by pointing, clicking, dragging, dropping.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.320]   If you are a JavaScript and HTML or CSS guru, they do have a developer platform that's beautiful,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   but you don't need to be.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.920]   And that's kind of the point of squarespace.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.000]   Best of all, this is $8 a month or start to $8 a month.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.440]   And that includes a free domain name when you sign up for a year.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.680]   They have the squarespace apps, the metric app for iPhone and iPad that lets you check
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   site stats like page views, unique visitors, even social media follows, a blog app that
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.000]   lets you post.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.360]   If you're a photographer, the iPad portfolio app is amazing.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.760]   It'll let you have a squarespace portfolio site and then automatically pull the images
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.920]   from it to show your clients those images in a gorgeous way.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.600]   This is the kind of attention to detail that makes squarespace unique.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.680]   It is fantastic plus the best support in the world 24/7 from the squarespace offices in
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.880]   New York City.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.120]   I want you to try it.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.200]   You can, I don't need to give you an offer code or anything.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.560]   You just go to squarespace.com and click get started.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.280]   You won't be giving a credit card just an email address, the name of your site and a
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   password.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   That's it.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.000]   You've got two weeks to really play with it and import your content even and change the
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.120]   templates at your whim.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.760]   But if you decide to buy, use the offer code twig, you'll get 10% off and you'll be showing
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.240]   your support for this week in Google.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   Squarespace.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.240]   I don't need to tell you.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.240]   You've heard me talk about it before.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   I'm sure.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.120]   Really is the place to run your site.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.360]   Leo support Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, enough one plus.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.480]   This should be for all about Android.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   This is all about Android.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.240]   Yeah, let's talk about Google.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   I like this.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   Let's not.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   They didn't invite us.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   What?
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   To Sicily?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   Yeah, to Sicily.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   They invited Ariana Huffington and not.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   Us.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   And why do you say it's their Davos?
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.960]   Well, that's what the rumors say it is.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.800]   They invited a whole bunch of important people and they didn't think were important and I'm
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   hurt.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.680]   Ariana Huffington among the luminaries attending an exclusive conference in Sicily being hosted
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.320]   by Google.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.200]   It's at Golf Resort in Sicily.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   CEOs invest.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   I know, Gina.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.960]   This is killing me.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   I'm just upset about this.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   Sicily trip.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.400]   Get chief executives, investors and celebrities, all of whom.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.840]   Oh, now I'm crying.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.720]   We're invited to bring their families on the agenda.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.560]   High minded discussions of global issues along with relaxation by the Mediterranean Sea.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.640]   Ariana, we'll teach you how to sleep.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:33.000]   Ben Horowitz from Andreessen Horowitz, John Doar from Kleiner Perkins, Elon Musk, the Tony
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.120]   Stark of our times, Travis Kalanek, the chief executive of Uber, Uber, the guy who
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:48.000]   founded Snapchat, Evan Segal, even actress Eva Longoria.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Ooh.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.680]   Fashion designer Tony Birch, Story Birch.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.120]   This is gets worse.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.040]   And this is what I'm sorry to miss.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.920]   The CEO of Comcast, Brian Roberts.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.160]   Brian, I want to cancel.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.200]   Leo, why would you want to cancel?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:12.360]   The conference has taken place at the luxurious Vadura Golf and Spa Resort on Sicily's southwestern
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   co-course.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.920]   Why they put this in the Huffpo?
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.880]   Six clay tennis courts, three golf courses and a spa.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.840]   One of the attendees, Ariana Huffington experienced this in the Huff post.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.040]   One of the attendees, our owner, experienced a travel mishap.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   This is the New York Times.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   This is the New York Times.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.080]   The New York, freaking Huffington's passport snapped.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:42.760]   She tweets, arrived at the airport in London, darling, for my flight to Palermo, realized
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.560]   I left my passport at the hotel.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   I was like a combination.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   I don't know what accent I want.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.720]   Now, of course, what she doesn't tweet is, so I sent my assistant Marla to go get it.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.640]   She better get back quickly.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   She made it there in the end.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   Buenas de Ceras Sicily.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:08.080]   I love how Dacia Mariani described it in the silent touches.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.800]   I interviewed Ariana when she was Ariana Stassen-Appolis-Huffington.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   Wow.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   That was her.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   You don't think about Ariana?
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   I love Ariana.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:21.560]   She is a trip and a half, but I really prefer the political Ariana to the Oprah Ariana.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.760]   Now she's gone full Oprah.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   Or Zhaja.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   Oh, fun.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   I love that.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.920]   Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   That's who you made her say.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   I'm out on the Huffington.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.040]   Ariana says she never says darling.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   I've never heard of that.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   She never says darling.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   She should say darling.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   That's Zhaja.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   That's Zhaja.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   That's Zhaja.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   That says that.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   Big story.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:52.000]   We covered this a lot on all of our shows starting Sunday, I think, on Twitter, Google,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.880]   shipped off authorities at the National Center for Missing and Exploiting Children that they
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.440]   had found child porn in somebody's Gmail account.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.120]   That person was arrested as a child pornographer.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.400]   But now, of course, while that's a good outcome, everybody's wondering, well, is Google looking
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.440]   at all the images in my Gmail?
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.960]   No.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   The answer is no.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.440]   No.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   I think what we know.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.440]   In fact, I think we...
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   I don't think we read this headline.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   We suspect this.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.120]   Well, what happened is a Houston man was arrested on charges of having and promoting
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   child pornography.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.160]   After Google told the National Center for Missing and Exploiting Children, he had pornographic
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.320]   child porn images in his Gmail account.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.600]   Because the images are fingerprinted, right?
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   That's...
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   Oh, the images are...
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   I don't know.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   How did they find this?
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.800]   This is the key bit of information that I think makes us okay, but let's let you be
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.160]   the judge.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:57.000]   The National Center for Missing and Exploiting Children, which is kind of quasi-governmental,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.040]   there actually is a legal reporting requirement to report child porn to them and they'll facilitate
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040]   the arrest.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.400]   If you don't, man, you can go to jail.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:15.320]   Because if somebody sent me a child porn image, I would immediately report them to the National
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.160]   Center for Missing and Exploiting Children.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.480]   Of course.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.440]   If you browse my one and don't...
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   It's in your cache.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.800]   It's in your cache and you don't call.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   You are liable.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   Okay.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   So you are legally compelled.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   This isn't a voluntary thing.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   Okay.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.000]   To facilitate this, the National Center for Missing and Exploiting Children, which I will
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.360]   now hear in after referred to as the NC-MEC.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   Nick.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   Nick.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   Nick.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   Nick.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   Nick.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.120]   They're always adding to this database of images that are illegal and hashing them.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.040]   So as you all know, because you're technically literate, hashing means going through that
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.440]   image and creating a number that fingerprints it.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.600]   It's accurately, precisely, with a fairly low, depending on...
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.400]   We don't know what technology they use, but a fairly low chance of false positives.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.320]   Maybe one in 50,000, one and a half a million.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   We don't know.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   The Managed Tenet Leo.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   It's not as if they put a fingerprint on the image as they have a...
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   They know what the image is.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.640]   They have a distillation of the image into a number.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   Signature.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   Signature.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.720]   And we don't know, though, if they use an MD5 hash, which has many more chances of false
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.880]   positives or whatever.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.520]   Nobody's told us that, but they have this database.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:41.920]   And it's my belief that every email provider has this database and routinely compares images.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.000]   Now, what they're not doing is looking at your image.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.160]   In processing your email, a computer has to take the email, scan it for things like the
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   address you're going to...
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.200]   It does scan it for that?
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   It has to do that.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.040]   And if you've got spam prevention, it has to scan for spam signatures, some of which
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.160]   may be hashes, some of which may be words.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.960]   So a computer is always churning through your email.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.840]   In this process, apparently, Google does make a hash of all images.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.040]   If the resulting fingerprint matches the fingerprint of the database, Bingo.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.680]   Now, what we don't know is what happens next.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.840]   Does somebody at Google look at the image?
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.320]   Some human has to look at the image because that's how you know if it was a false positive.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.400]   Do they merely forward the mail automatically to the National Center for Missing and Explorator
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000]   Children who then do that?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.240]   Some human at some point, or maybe law enforcement, has to look at the image and say, yes, Bingo,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.200]   this isn't a pornographic image.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.040]   So do we know for sure that every email provider is required to do this?
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   Does every email provider does Hotmail do this?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   Yahoo Mail.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.880]   Everybody who provides an email services does this match against this database of signatures
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.360]   for all attachments and every email?
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:57.240]   I'm on the United States Department of Justice page, the Child Exploitation and Abscenities
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.760]   section where it says how to report child pornography, to report an incident involving
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.480]   the production, possession, distribution, or receipt of child pornography, file a report
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.640]   at the NCMEC's website at cybertipline.com or call an 800 number.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.360]   Your report will be forwarded to law enforcement agency for investigation and action.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.320]   That sounds to me like law enforcement ultimately gets the image and decides.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.760]   You may also wish to report to federal, state, or local law enforcement personnel, but the
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.440]   DOJ says call the NCMEC.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   I would bet you.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.200]   There is a legal reporting requirement.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:42.600]   I would bet you that every, I don't know because we don't, this is a reporting requirement,
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.160]   but is there a scanning requirement?
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.800]   No, I guarantee you there's not a scanning requirement, but there is a reporting requirement.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:57.000]   So I would bet you every email provider who doesn't want to fight child pornography.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Right.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And if every provider is doing this, they're not advertising it.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Of course not.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   No.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.200]   But at the same time, just like you and me, they don't want to be held responsible for
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.800]   forwarding child porn.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.240]   Yeah, they don't want the story to come up and say, "Oh, the permused, you know,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.240]   hotmail for the last few years."
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   Okay.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   It would make perfect sense to me.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.960]   And if I were Microsoft, you'd damn well better bet I'd be using this database.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:31.240]   It doesn't, it's a simple, easy thing to do that I believe does not invade privacy because
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.640]   no one's looking at your email.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   I agree.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.880]   However, it launched from chorus techno panic immediately.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.560]   Oh my God.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.400]   Google's reading all of our emails and all of our images and horrible things are happening.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.440]   Well, I admit, and I sure Gina too, until you understand how they're doing it, there's
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.440]   some cause for concern.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   It's a question.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   I mean, it's a question.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.200]   And I thought to myself, okay, does this mean that Google is scanning every image and
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.080]   doing facial or object recognitions?
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.320]   That I do not believe they are doing.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.960]   And that was the question we had.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   Because we know you can scan, for instance, for a certain percentage of flesh.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.160]   And Google has already said we can, in Google plus, we can distinguish between a child and
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   an adult.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.840]   So it's not so far fetched to think that Google could in their technology scan for child porn.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.880]   They, I don't believe they are doing that.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.040]   I don't think that's something they'd want to do.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.520]   No.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.160]   Because of the chance of false positives.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.960]   What they could, and this is, I mean, this is interesting.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   I mean, I feel like the technopanic was, well, what else?
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   How else is Gmail scanning my messages in a way that maybe I didn't know they were doing
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   before?
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   Google said we're not doing those.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.760]   This is all we're doing.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.760]   Right.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   Right.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   Here's a related.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.040]   I have emails, photos to my, you know, my mother of the baby in a bathing suit or in
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   her diaper.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.480]   It gave me pause for a second.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.320]   Like, oh, I mean, obviously it's not.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.360]   Well, and that's to me why Google is not going to be scanned for flesh and child.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.760]   They're going to use this NCMEC database, which is known child porn images.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.960]   Because the truth is people who are traffic and child porn very almost always argue are
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.880]   trafficking in these known images.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.160]   You know, as soon as you, as soon as they bust somebody and prosecute and successfully
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.960]   prosecute them, they've got the database of their images.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.600]   These people typically collect thousands of images.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.920]   This is whenever you hear somebody was arrested for this.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   They got stacks of stuff.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.320]   And the way we used to work is, you know, we've seen the stories, you know, right, where
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.560]   you have the innocent bathtub photo and the parents are hauled away because of the kid
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.640]   at the photo kiosk when your film came back made a bad judgment.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.680]   So here's a court case.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.960]   This is a court case going back a ways.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   And thank you to the chatroom.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.720]   They've provided me with this link before.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:56.680]   In 2004 and 2005 AOL's image detection and filtering program, a routine scanning program,
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.040]   AOL use for security purposes, recognize the digital.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.440]   This is 2004, 10 years ago, the digital fingerprint of certain files is child pornography and pursuant
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:13.040]   to the mandatory reporting requirement, USC 13032 B1 AOL reported the transmission to
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040]   cyber tip line.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.480]   This is 10 years ago.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.520]   The law enforcement traced the transmissions and arrested somebody before trial.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:27.240]   The suspect moved to suppress the evidence saying AOL was acting as an agent of the government
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.200]   when it scanned the email attachments.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   Therefore, the government had constituted and conducted an unconstitutional warrantless
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.000]   search of his email.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.280]   It violated his fourth amendment.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:43.320]   The court denied saying AOL was not acting as a government's agency because the discovery
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.240]   of the pornography was the result of routine scanning conducted to recognize files that
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   may be detrimental to AOL.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.640]   So the fourth circuit affirmed that, by the way.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:58.280]   So there is case law, not going to the Supreme Court, but going to the federal court, the
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.400]   fourth circuit, that that is not an unwarranted search and seizure.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.880]   Recognize, okay, files that may be detrimental to AOL.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.520]   So Google could be liable for hosting.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   Yes.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   They would be.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   They would be.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   So this isn't about Google's, you know, trying to adopt top pornographyers, right?
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520]   And this is about a liability issue for them.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.520]   Well, they may scan also for other things, viruses in images.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.520]   They certainly do.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.520]   They do.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.520]   They should.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520]   You want them to.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   Okay.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:35.000]   13032, explicitly states, nothing in this section may be construed to require a provider
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.840]   to electronic communication services to engage in monitoring any user.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.920]   But there is a mandatory reporting requirement.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.760]   So to answer your question, they're not required to scan, but they are required to report should
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.760]   they learn.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.040]   But that could go see your earlier discussion.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.720]   If you're one of these companies, do you really want to not scan?
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.480]   The last thing you want is a newspaper story saying, and the perpetrator used Gmail to
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.280]   exchange pornographic images with thousands of others all over the country.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.400]   But Gmail caches copies these images too.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   So Gmail is hosting images.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   They're storing them.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.400]   They're storing them.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.200]   Even they know that hot links, images and other places, Gmail now caches.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.360]   So there is a liability where they are storing these images on their servers.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.800]   So I see that, of course, I buy the argument that they may feel morally compelled to scan
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   for this kind of thing.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:32.360]   But I think that being compelled legally, I think, makes a lot of sense as well.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.880]   Somebody in the chair was pointing out that both Google and Facebook scan faces in images
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.240]   to tag them.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.840]   That's done automatically, right?
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   Well, not your email.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   No.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.840]   It's images put up in public.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.840]   Okay.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   You're a shivering.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.520]   And you're agreeing, and you're agreeing, by the way, to those terms of service when
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.520]   you.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.600]   Yeah, and you're agreeing and you opt into it and you can see that they're doing it,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.560]   you know, which is, which is different.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.480]   I think a little different than I've sent this message and so I think Google is like,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.560]   I would have a list of all the things that all the processes that Google runs on every
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.160]   message I send and what they're looking for.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.320]   Viruses, spam, child porn, faces, docs, I don't know.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.280]   I think you could assume all of the above, right?
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.240]   I mean, and it's- Yeah, but like what else?
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.360]   It's kind of part of the intake, right?
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.840]   If for instance, if they're, if they're caching files, then they have to have an unique identifier
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:28.000]   for each file to prevent to the caching, only works if you know it's identical, right?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.760]   So I mean, this is all part of the intake.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   Jack Schafer.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.720]   Jack Schafer and Reuters raises a question and I think it's legitimate.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:43.080]   All right, so let's say that in another country where homosexuality is forbidden, they say
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.920]   that you have to find homosexual images and report them to us.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.640]   Is this a technological capability that could be misused?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:59.800]   And we will provide you with a hash of a thousand, a million homosexual photos and
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.560]   require you to both scan and report.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.480]   I think you can pretty much count on Google not to do that.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.240]   I think you can, but what's the basis?
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.400]   What's the argument?
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   Well, that's the-
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   The whole local law.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.200]   That's the big issue that we're seeing with the right to be forgotten, right?
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.160]   Where a country can compel Google to act in odd ways.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.600]   I mean, you can't sell Nazi memorabilia on eBay.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.120]   That's a German requirement.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.120]   Right.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.120]   Right.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:34.600]   Well, I mean, that's kind of a larger question for this global world, you know, where you
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.240]   have business.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.920]   On the face of it, I have absolutely no problem with what Google did.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.840]   Google explicitly told Business Insider that it does not scan for evidence of other potential
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.360]   crimes.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.200]   It said explicitly that's the only crime it scans for.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   And they have said this all along in 2006.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.720]   The local Chief Legal Officer David Drummond said Google has a zero tolerance policy against
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.200]   child sexual abuse imagery.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.080]   They've been very, very active in that.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.440]   They say explicitly that they don't look for other crimes.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.040]   However, in the terms of service, quote, "Our automated systems analyze your content, including
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.520]   emails.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.880]   This analysis," we've talked about this before, "analysis occurs as a content is sent, received,
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.680]   and then when it's stored."
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.720]   So, you know, they have kind of a blanket license to go through.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.760]   The next step here is that somebody looked at the site telling you how to make a shoe
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.400]   bomb.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.000]   Somebody emailed a picture.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Well, okay.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Shoo bomb.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.760]   And this is, you know, by the way, Jack is saying the dangers of deputizing Google to bust
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   child pornography.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.240]   It's not, they have not been deputized.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.040]   They're not making a judgement here.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.840]   So it's completely possible to come up with a million scenarios that would be very, very
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   bad.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.840]   Right.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:51.840]   But that's a foolish exercise.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.920]   That's the essence of technopatic.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   I agree.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.640]   I mean, I can think of all sorts of horrible scenarios, but they're not doing that.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   So...
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   Right.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.640]   I agree.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.640]   No, I...
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.440]   The fact that they have the ability you may not like, but the thing I tell everybody is...
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.160]   I think you guys would agree with that.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.400]   If you want to make the internet private, you're going to break the internet.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.920]   That's what the right to be forgotten does.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   It breaks the internet.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.800]   And so yes, I can see all sorts of horrific scenarios, but the fact is using the internet
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.120]   is not private any more than going to the mall is private.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.720]   And trying to mold the internet to make it private is going to break it.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.880]   Just as if you said, "I have the right to be private at the mall," you don't.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   So don't go...
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.480]   All I can say is don't go to the mall.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.200]   I don't think it's possible to make the internet private.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.320]   Well, it's not possible to have a presumption of privacy in public because then we...
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   That's what I wrote in my book.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320]   This is what we...
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.040]   When we ruin the notion of not just the internet, but of public.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.160]   And it ruins things like journalism.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.160]   You can't report on me, the mayor, being caught going into the opium den because I have a
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   presumption of privacy.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.080]   What did you think of a Neil's wonderful article and medium?
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   Oh, yes.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   I'm glad you asked Lillio.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.240]   I was going to ask what I didn't want to...
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.760]   Such a great article.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   And I think so right on about this whole issue of privacy.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.160]   I'm sure you read it, Jeff, right?
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   I started to...
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   I started to...
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   I started to...
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.160]   TLDR.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   Because there was also...
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.440]   I think Zainib did a response to him.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.800]   Zainib did a response on what is privacy, yeah.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.200]   And now Dana Boyd, of course, and by the way, she had something to say about all of this
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   stuff.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.520]   But I presume she would err on the side of privacy because she...
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.160]   With all her work with young people, she understands how important privacy is to them.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:49.120]   Well, but no, Dana also understands the value of publicness and sharing.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   And sees...
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   Tech Propanic.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.920]   Dana's very quite, quite, quite rational about these topics.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   And it's part of...
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.160]   I just thought what a Neil brought up was really right on his article.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.160]   What is public?
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.260]   It's so simple, right?
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.360]   He says...
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.880]   He points out that, let's say, an addiction recovery group decides to take advantage of
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.800]   the summer weather and meet in a park across the street.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.040]   Legally, you could take photos of the members.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.360]   You could tag it with the names of their employers, friends, and family.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.720]   Make sure no one missed it.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.240]   Conversations to take place in public parks are public.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.360]   We have this problem now with drones.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.920]   Paparazzi are using drones.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:29.200]   And it is illegal unless it violates FAA rules because you're in public.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.840]   He says, "Public is not simply defined.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:39.280]   It's a fragile set of social conventions about what behaviors are acceptable and appropriate."
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:46.480]   He kind of berates media, the news media, that benefits from the gray area by, for instance,
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.800]   republishing tweets by saying, "Well, hey, it's in the public.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   I..."
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.240]   Well, I think this is where he and Neil and Jeff probably depart because Neil is arguing
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.800]   for consent and journalism.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.760]   And he and I have this debate over lunch a few times and I wouldn't necessarily go that
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   far.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.680]   He quotes Hamilton Nolan of Gawker, "The things you read on Twitter are public.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.000]   They are published on the World Wide Web.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.880]   They can be read almost instantly by anyone with an internet connection on the planet Earth.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.040]   This is not a bug in Twitter.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.440]   It's a feature.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.120]   This is something that sounds like he's channeling Jeff."
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.960]   It's a feature of society.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   If I...
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   All right, so we're off the air and I tell you something, Leo.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.480]   Not me, not on the off the air when we're...
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.120]   Right, on the show, but we're in the pre or post show.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   No, no, no.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   I mean, we're in your office.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   Okay, we're in my office.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   And I tell you something.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:40.360]   The way I expressed it in public parts is that privacy is a responsibility.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.120]   It's an ethic of knowing someone else's information.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.440]   And so once I've told you, it is public to that extent.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.640]   I no longer control that at all.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:56.200]   However, in the past, there has been, I think, in journalism a scale that you can weigh it
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.800]   on, public good versus personal privacy.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.880]   And if, for instance, you are the attorney general of the United States, you have a lowered
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:11.040]   expectation because the public needs to know if you're up to no good.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.640]   Whereas if it's just some guy down the street, there is a...
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.400]   There is kind of a burden on the journalist to say, "Let's respect that guy's privacy."
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.320]   Even though he's put it on Twitter, there's not a need to know this, right?
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   And not privacy.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   It's privacy.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.520]   It's more of a question of choosing not to use the power of media to give notoriety to
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.520]   something that doesn't deserve it or right.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.200]   I think that's all that Leo is calling for.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.200]   He's let's...
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   But there is.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.960]   But, but, but.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.600]   It's not just the internet, it's not just technology.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.880]   Whatever I've told anyone through history, you know, we learn this on the third grade
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.240]   playground.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.960]   You tell somebody something and you think they're not going to tell everybody and you go to the
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.600]   lunchroom table and they're told everybody.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   And it's uncool.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.080]   Well, or it is or it isn't.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   The point is...
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.440]   They say, "Well, that's my right because you said it in public.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.400]   I'm going to sock them."
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.120]   The person who receives...
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.960]   But, but, but, but, I tell you I have prostate cancer and a malfunctioning penis, you think
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   well, I want to keep that quiet.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.280]   And then I go around on a broadcast.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.280]   Well, that's your choice.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.280]   That is, but that's right.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   But that's your choice.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.120]   But the point is, the point is you, you have to judge the context, which is a, which is
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.200]   a point that Helen Weber makes at NYU.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.960]   It's very hard to do.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.920]   The reader you or the person whose privacy was violent.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:26.200]   Well, in this case, I told you in your office this and, and I may be telling you because
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:31.160]   I, I, I, I'm confiding in a, in a, in a male friend of mine, I may be telling you because
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.760]   I want to make sure you get tested.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.080]   I may be telling you because I want you to spread the word in your powerful voice and
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.680]   get other people tested.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.080]   You know, there, there's a context of this.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   I understand.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:44.960]   But the issue that Neil's raising is there is a, there is, there are in some cases a real
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:50.520]   journalistic response, responsibility to reveal this information.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.360]   And then there are in some cases, it's exploitation.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:00.120]   That is good for business, but it is, there's no public need to know.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   It's irresponsibility.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   It's, it's, yeah.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:08.560]   All of it is technically public, but that's important consideration when revealing.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.200]   And what he's saying is the business models of some of the most powerful forces in society
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.000]   are increasingly the media are increasingly dependent on our complicity in making our
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.640]   conversations, our creations, our communities public whenever they can exploit public.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.920]   Twitter is, the difference is this, if I go to Facebook and I do a private message to
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.640]   you or I go to email to private message to you, same as if I do it on the street, same
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.960]   issues I just outlined.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.440]   Twitter is different because I can go to Twitter and I can search on embarrassing.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   Of course.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.800]   All of this is factually true.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.560]   He's just saying don't be a jerk.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   Right.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.760]   There's a difference between technically public, right?
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.500]   Of course, factually it's public.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.960]   It's a rational social convention.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.320]   But don't be an asshole.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.280]   There's no, but there's fine, but there's also a difference.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.340]   It is a more public act.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.160]   Being on Twitter is a more public act than telling someone to disagree.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.440]   I think a lot of people use Twitter knowing it's public, but they're having a semi private
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.440]   commerce.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.880]   They're at replying somebody else.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.200]   They know that technically it's public, but they don't expect and you think it's completely
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:15.240]   wrong of them to expect that people will buy social warring alone.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.920]   What's the functionality Leo of search?
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   Two things can happen.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.320]   One is somebody, whoever I said this to can retweet it and it can go around the world.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.320]   And then who's it?
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.320]   Who's at fault there?
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.320]   You know, the first retweet or the tenth retweeter.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.920]   And Twitter search.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:38.360]   If I go searching for small penis pictures, God knows what I'll find, but I'll find them.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.480]   And that's no.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:46.000]   If I put up a web page and I only tell you the URL, but Google finds it.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Is that wrong?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.520]   No, it's on the net.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.720]   What do you think Gina?
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:59.240]   I agree with Anil that it's extremely complicated.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.520]   The reason why part of this came up is because Shanley Kane was getting profiled by Medium
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.440]   by Elizabeth Spears.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:10.200]   And she objected to the entire process because she felt like she did not give her consent.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.480]   There was a point during the interview where she felt like the questions were invasive
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.240]   and she didn't want to participate.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.000]   And Liz basically said, look, I'm doing this profile.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.520]   I'm going to talk to your friends and family.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.120]   This is how journalism works.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.360]   And Shanley was like, this is harassment.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.240]   You should require my consent.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:32.120]   And then that prompted Jason Kalkana saying journalism doesn't require consent.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.840]   And I actually agree.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.080]   I don't think that journalism does require consent.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.440]   And Anil was saying in that piece that he thinks that it should.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.400]   I think that that would mean that only the stories that people were okay with getting
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.080]   reported would get reported.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.160]   And that I think would do a great disservice.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:55.080]   So I agree with Anil's larger point that it's complicated and it's nuanced.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:00.680]   And Dana's take on the privacy part of it was kind of the same thing that it's nuanced
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   and complicated.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.160]   And it's not about whether or not something is technically public or private.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.440]   It's about social convention amores and those things have to evolve, especially with the
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.320]   new tools that we have.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.480]   And they are new tools.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:16.440]   But I don't think there are sort of black and white lines here on this.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.400]   Here's what Dana says, and I actually very much agree with Dana Boyd.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.720]   She says, "The very practice of privacy is all about control in a world in which we
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.560]   fully know we never have control.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.640]   Our friends might betray us.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.080]   Our spaces might be surveilled.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.240]   Our expectations might be shattered.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.160]   But this is why achieving privacy is desirable.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.080]   People want to be in public."
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.640]   But that doesn't necessarily mean they want to be public and there's a huge difference.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.680]   She says, "As Anneal points out our lives are shaped by all sorts of unspoken social
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.480]   agreements, allowing..."
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.400]   And this is where I do agree with her, although I don't know what you do about it.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:58.480]   "Allowing organizations or powerful actors to undermine these social agreements for personal
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:04.920]   gain may not be illegal, but it does tear at the social fabric."
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   You can't disagree with that, Joe.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.920]   Yes, it always has.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   It always has.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.600]   That's why the hacking case in the UK with Murdoch's publications.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:16.360]   It goes exactly to that because they tore into something that indeed was private.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.320]   It was messages with your phone.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.840]   And it tears at the social fabric.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.520]   We would all agree that that's wrong and bad and they did get prosecuted and some of
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   them got damaged.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.600]   And you're going overboard.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:30.040]   You know, some 15-year-olds has something on Twitter and the New York Post puts it on
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.400]   page one and ridicules the person that's bullying.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.400]   Right.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.860]   But that's not about privacy.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:42.360]   That's about the overuse of that power for no good reason but economic gain.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.360]   But is that clear though?
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:49.520]   I mean, when BuzzFeed does a top 10 list and just does a list of tweets by people who
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.400]   have 10 or 12 followers who are just regular Twitter users, just talking to their friends
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.360]   and kind of puts them in the public eye and then wraps it and adds as the deal said,
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.760]   you know, is that?
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.400]   Do web content producers see that as unethical?
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   Is it unethical?
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   Is it okay?
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   I got one.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.120]   I'll give you the same example I just gave.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:17.600]   If I put up a web page and I only give you the URL but it's searchable on Google and
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.080]   you can find it.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   Is that wrong?
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.880]   No, I put something up on the public net.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.880]   I mean, where are you?
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   I'll give you a good example.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.720]   Let me give you a personal example because these are very abstract.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.240]   So I post pictures of my family trips.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:37.680]   I inadvertently reveal text messages on the air.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.960]   A reporter at Gawker, Ryan Tate goes through all of this stuff, really spends a long time,
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:47.400]   obviously, going through all this stuff to write a story about how I'm having an affair
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.600]   and my family doesn't know.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.760]   A story that wasn't factually wrong except my family didn't know.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.000]   And I wasn't having a affair but he didn't have all the details because there was some
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.440]   private stuff about the fact that I'd already separated from my wife, et cetera.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.600]   And it was a very hurtful article that came out on Christmas Eve.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   Right.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:12.040]   Nothing illegal done, completely amassed from public record, however, an extremely hurtful
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.720]   and I think wrong article.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720]   Am I wrong?
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.640]   And I threw down with Ryan about that article.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.920]   I was really pissed at him about that and he and I went back and forth about it in private
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:27.160]   over email because I said to him that I thought that it was, it was, well, my problem with
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.880]   that piece is that he hadn't ever gotten in touch with you for comments and he published
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.960]   it on Christmas Eve, which is felt like such a hit.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Well, whatever.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   I don't want to get into this whole thing.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.000]   But I had a serious problem with that and I talked to him and I talked to Nick and we
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.360]   kind of agreed to disagree in the end, but he really argued with me about it because I
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.600]   guess my opinion still holds sway and he was, I used to work at Gawker.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.960]   But yeah, no, I, so like, but the line isn't clear.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.400]   I guess this is, this is what I'm saying.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   The line isn't clear.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.400]   The line isn't clear.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.400]   Right.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   That's true.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.920]   There was no, it, it, drielistically, there was no news value, news judgment to what was
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   done.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.160]   It was done clearly just to exploit and to get.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.640]   Well, that's the kind of stuff we're talking about.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   That's where I'm saying the balance.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:12.120]   There's a balance between the public's need to know and the legal right to do it versus
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.480]   the socially responsible.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.680]   And that has existed since the penny press that has existed for a hundred years.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.440]   That's always, that's always been why people feared the camera.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:25.760]   And I think what led, but I think what Neil's saying is that that, that balance is no longer
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   being observed.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   We have in the past trusted institutions.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   Never been observed.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.760]   It's never been observed.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:36.640]   Media had, the yellow journalism was around for years and years and years.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.280]   And Schmuck's archbox, they're spucked around.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.800]   That was a schmuckish horrible thing to do.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.560]   It was, it was no good reason for it.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.760]   And it was, yeah, it's genius.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   Well, it was a good reason for it.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.560]   That is a very highly read article.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.160]   They got lots of, lots of revenue.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.480]   Yeah, there was an economic reason.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.400]   But there was no, there was no social reason to do it.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.800]   There was no higher journalist end to doing it.
[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.800]   There was no need to do it.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.720]   Well, that's what I'm saying is that, and there's, by the way, there's no law you're
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   going to make about this.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:09.800]   But I think it's appropriate to call out media institutions when they choose to exploit for
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:15.720]   economic benefit as opposed to do what they're supposed to do, which is represent the interests
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.280]   of the public.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.520]   So I've just finished my draft.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.360]   You never going to read the Believe me, you never going to read this.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.720]   I've written a 55,000 word tome on white paper.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.040]   And now that the internet has screwed up everything in Java, it's what now?
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.120]   And I focus on new relationships and new forms and new models.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.960]   And in trying to judge what journalism we should save, if we're so worried about journalism,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.680]   what we're not worried about, the helicopter showing you the fire 10 miles away, which
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.840]   isn't going to affect you, we're not worried about those stories you just mentioned.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.680]   We're not worried about the 40th reporting of the weather or for that matter, reporting
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.280]   on a football game or a celebrity.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.360]   What's the essence of journalism that we really care about?
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.520]   And I end up giving a, I start with a very broad definition of journalism, which is helping
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.880]   communities organize their knowledge to better organize themselves.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.520]   And then I narrowed it down in this analysis of saying, what do we save?
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.040]   What do we risk of?
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.200]   That's a very narrow part of journalism.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.920]   And that's journalism to me that is in fact advocacy, this advocacy for improving society,
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.120]   for improving your life, for, and that includes things like getting the bad guys, but it
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.440]   includes other things.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.920]   Now, to me that is journalism.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   Everything else is entertainment.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.840]   Now, if I say that, I'm going to get in tons of trouble.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.680]   And economically, I have to broaden that back out again and include the football in it again
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.240]   and include the fires and the weather.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240]   I would agree with you.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   I 100%.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   I think you're right on.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.360]   So in that case, to make a journalistic analysis of this, there was absolutely zero
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.920]   justification for what Docker did to you.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.640]   It was not journalistic at all.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.720]   It was purely salacious entertainment.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.160]   Full stop.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.520]   They should be ashamed of themselves.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520]   It wasn't journalism.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.240]   It's not Nick's Nick's argument is I don't know.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.800]   I don't accuse myself of doing journalism.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.800]   I do what I do.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.360]   No, but this is what Neneal's saying is that these institutions say, but it's all in public.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.080]   Everything they used was in public.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.760]   The argument was Leo's a person of interest.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.320]   And this was this was this screenshot was a matter.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.480]   It wasn't just a screenshot.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.640]   It was images from my Flickr feed.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   It was all public.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.720]   They didn't delve into anything that was not public.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.520]   The only thing they did is they focused it by taking it all, putting it together.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.160]   It's not an issue of publicness or privacy.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.160]   That's the wrong analysis.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.120]   I would argue with Neneal and I'll take him off for drinks and we'll do this.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.080]   I would argue it's a public interest analysis as the core of journalism.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.080]   I agree.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   I agree with that.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.000]   But that's what I'm saying is that you have to weigh public interest versus people's right
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   to be left alone.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   Let's not use privacy.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Right to be left alone.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.320]   So the guy who took the picture of the plane in the Hudson.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.320]   He had I don't know.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.960]   He had let's say he had 10 followers.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.040]   Well that was public interest.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040]   Right.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040]   So the issue is it's probably not with that.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040]   Oh, you can't use that.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]   You can't use that.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   You can't report it.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040]   That was public.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.040]   You posted it.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040]   That was the only thing I've ever seen.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040]   That analysis doesn't work.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040]   It's a good article.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040]   Read that.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   Read Dana Boyd's response.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   Both of them are medium.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.920]   Anil Dash and Dana Boyd.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.540]   I think it's a really important argument and it points to a really good piece by John
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:21.560]   Oliver this week on native media and I'm sure a native content which is another form, by
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.160]   the way, of this kind of I think slipping standard in journalism.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   Yes, I agree.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   Oh, I didn't see this.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   Oh, it's good.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.160]   It's pretty long.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:37.680]   I don't know if we're going to air it but I got to air one little bit of it.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.440]   The New York Times sales woman.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.000]   Oh, that part.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   I also think the song.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.160]   What's her name?
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.080]   He sings a, it was so, you know what?
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.960]   At first I didn't watch John Oliver's this week, last week tonight or whatever it's called
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.120]   because I said it's just a rip off of the Daily Show.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120]   Come on, John.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.360]   You know, you just, you stole John Stewart's format and of course he's a former Daily
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.800]   Show reporter.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.520]   But I have to say he has done such great advocacy.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:12.760]   He's done such great advocacy journalism and who knows anything about native content.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.360]   This is not something that is talked about in mainstream media.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.920]   We talk about it all the time.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.800]   This is the advertisement hiding his editorial content.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:27.920]   Very famously, was it Forbes that allowed the church of Scientology to write a, no, that
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   was the Atlantic.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.640]   They Atlantic even worse.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.280]   Yeah, because they just weren't off the, off the the Atlantic, allowed the church of Scientology
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.400]   to write a puff piece about the church of Scientology posted on their website as if it
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.400]   were an article.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.320]   It says in fine print, you know, this is paid for.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.480]   But this, this new idea of native content is everybody knows an attempt to trick viewers
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.080]   into thinking they're watching editorial content when they're really just watching advertising
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.080]   content.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.880]   So, so Forbes is the one that allows advertisers to have what they call brand voice and they
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.080]   have a little link next to it that says, what's this?
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.400]   As I've said to them, if you have to say, what's this?
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.160]   Clearly the label ain't clear enough.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.600]   So it's an effort to move.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.120]   Now the New York Times, the other hand, has started into this and they have to, and this
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.280]   has paid post and they change the color and they change the font and they do all kinds
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   of stuff.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.880]   So they have a feature about women in prison tied to orange was the new black.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:25.000]   But it troubles me because the reader is going to ask, well, this is such a good story.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   Why didn't you assign this?
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.080]   Why didn't you do this journalistically?
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.520]   And if it's an ad really for that, then did you soften this?
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.560]   You know, what was the, what was the influence of the advertiser?
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   You're fine.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.800]   You said paid post, but you're using your motif of telling me a journalistic story.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.960]   Now for the sake of the advertiser, it's going to hurt the brand.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.200]   It hurt Forbes brand.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.760]   They were sold for less than they wanted because of this.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   Good.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   I don't know.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.440]   And it did hurt the Atlantic's brand briefly.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.200]   Let me see if I can find this.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.800]   The New York Times has engaged in this as well.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.880]   You'd think the Auguste New York Times would be somewhat above this.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:06.960]   And he plays a little bit of a clip from, you know what you want at four minutes, started
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.320]   in four minutes because that's the Jonah Paretti part.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.840]   Well, here's Meredith Levy and she's executive vice president of advertising.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.920]   Let's be fair at the New York Times.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:23.240]   Let me start by vigorously refuting the notion that native advertising has to erode consumer
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.800]   trust or compromise the wall that exists between editorial and advertising.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.760]   Good native advertising is just not meant to be trickery.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.920]   Well, obviously that's, it wouldn't be good native advertising if it didn't trick the reader
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.520]   into thinking they were reading editorial.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.760]   It's meant to be publishers sharing its storytelling tools with a marketer.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.000]   It's publishers sharing their storytelling tools.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Wow.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   With marketers.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Exactly.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Exactly.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   It's not trickery.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.960]   It's sharing storytelling tools.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.800]   And that's not, it's repurposed bovine waste.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.680]   If you go to four minutes, Leo, the stuff under Paretti Ag is pretty funny.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   Okay, let me find that.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.160]   And then I'm going to play the Pepsi commercial because I think that's a really good example.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.640]   That was, that was a beautiful thing.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.000]   It's messages that are often clear endorsements.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.920]   And if you'll excuse me, I'll just take a break from making this point by enjoying the
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.520]   refreshing taste of Mountain Dew code red.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.080]   And then it's at this point that you usually realise, oh, this isn't the thing that I was
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.080]   looking for.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.960]   You're just advertising the most disgusting f*** drink ever manufactured.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:35.520]   Although, although, I will say it does undeniably taste of red.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.120]   Who's the Paretti?
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.200]   Native advertising, though, has been so lucrative for new media organisations.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.600]   They basically built their entire business model around it.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.160]   100% of revenue comes from brand and content.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.600]   So we have a lot of partners who are marketers.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.040]   This is the CEO of Buzzfeed, Jonah Paretti, talking about it.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.280]   Brilliant, brilliant technologist.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.640]   He was the technologist behind the pop-in and post, Jonah's amazing.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   Jonah's amazing.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.240]   Well, and he's succeeded amazingly.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.560]   He justifies Buzzfeed.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:12.320]   And major brands who are with 76 of the top 100 brands now.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.080]   That's the CEO of Buzzfeed, Jonah Paretti.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.040]   And his face is like Buzzfeed itself.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.040]   Successful, appealing, and yet somehow you want to punch it.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:26.720]   So he's saying that almost all of our content comes from advertisers.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720]   Is that what he said?
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.880]   Well, not all of our advertisers.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   But they have top advertisers.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.200]   John Oliver says, hey, if you're going to stick advertising in our news, you're going
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.480]   to be able to stick news in your advertising.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480]   Yeah, advertising.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.640]   [MUSIC]
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.760]   When you get hot, you get thirsty.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:54.120]   And when you get thirsty, there's only one choice.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.080]   Let's drink a diet.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   Diet Coke.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:03.880]   The recent Ebola outbreak has killed over 700 people in my staff.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.280]   The World Health Organization says they don't yet have it under control.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.120]   And the situation threatens to become catastrophic.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:16.600]   [MUSIC]
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.040]   Now that is a better world, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.520]   The fate of journalism.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.880]   Last week tonight, it's on HBO.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.200]   I wanted to hate it.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.560]   I love John Oliver and his Daily Bugle is one of the best podcasts ever recorded.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.040]   And still doing it, I think.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.800]   But he's taking it to television.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.080]   And you know what, John?
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.160]   Go ahead, steal John Stewart's format.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.160]   Doesn't matter.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   You do a great job.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   It's so good.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.880]   We're going to take a break, our show today is snack time.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.240]   This is not native content.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.760]   This is an ad.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.600]   [LAUGH]
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.760]   But a delicious one.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.560]   A delicious ad.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.840]   So I don't think, please make me feel better, Jeff.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.360]   There's no, you know when you see an ad on Twitter that it's an advertisement that
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.360]   somebody paid us to talk about it.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.960]   This is radio forever.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.520]   So we know that.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.720]   You changed tone.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.120]   Everybody, the question is if you don't know it.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.000]   Right, am I trying to trick you?
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.200]   If I did a review of the OnePlus and raved about it and it was paid by OnePlus, that
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:23.840]   would be a complete betrayal of my integrity and our compact, unwritten, unspoken compact
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.840]   with the audience.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.840]   But it's all through the show.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840]   You kept popping in those very delicious.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.440]   And they are delicious, by the way.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:32.480]   So, you have to have a little bit of a puddle of corn, nuggets that happen to come from
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.720]   your sponsor and never told us what your sponsor just said, mmm, yum, that's fully people.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.680]   However, we do have to have snacks.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.360]   So this is nature box and I love this for a couple of reasons.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.720]   First of all, these are really good snacks, as you both know, because we've sent you nature
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   boxes.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.080]   But, more than that, they're healthful snacks because their nutrition has to prove no high
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.400]   fructose corn syrup.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:02.440]   No artificial flavors, no trans fats, none of the stuff that we know is bad and good stuff.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.920]   And you can even tailor it.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.480]   You know, there's hundreds of snacks.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.120]   So if you want a nature box, and by the way, these are delivered to your door monthly.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.440]   So it's a nice little subscription thing, or you can buy just one box.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.000]   But if you want to say, I don't, I'm a vegan, just send me vegan stuff.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   They can do that.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   I am gluten conscious.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   Don't, none of that gluten.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.840]   Okay, no gluten.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840]   You can have savory.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   You can have sweet.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.480]   You can have spicy.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.280]   You can totally control this.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.440]   And before you buy even, you can look at the ingredients.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.720]   Look at what's in here.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.240]   I think you will be very happy.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.680]   These are very pure, very simple, but very delicious, like sea salt, sun crunch, sunflower
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.960]   sesame seeded crackers, or, oh, I've been wanting to open this one coconut cashews.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.360]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.000]   So what's in coconut cashews?
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   What do you think?
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.560]   Cashews, cane sugar, coconut, rice syrup, natural flavor, and salt.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.760]   That's it.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   And you know that, right?
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   You know what's in it.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   Now here's the deal.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.560]   We're going to give you a half off, but no GMOs.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560]   That's right.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.800]   We're going to give you a half off when you go to naturebox.com/twit and use the offer
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:10.480]   code twit so you can at least try a box and see if you like it.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.920]   They should, this is a meal out.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.920]   That is so good.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.240]   Coconuts and cashews together.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   And by the way, they do a nice thing.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.240]   Meals, what is it called?
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.120]   Meals for America.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.360]   They donate meals.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.720]   You scroll down, it's on there somewhere.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.360]   They donate meals when you buy a nature box.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.640]   So it's a really, they're going for 1 million meals to hungry families in the US.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:41.040]   So you'll feel good about it all ways around naturebox.com/twitnaturebox.com.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.640]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.200]   Together we fight hunger for every box we deliver.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.520]   We are donating a meal.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.560]   Wow.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.960]   We're feeding America.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.640]   For every box you get a meal.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.800]   That's good.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.160]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.560]   Use the offer code twit to get 50% off.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.560]   It's good stuff.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.560]   It's just really good.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.560]   It is good stuff.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.840]   These are all zip lock though so you can have a small amount.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.520]   Put it away for later.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.880]   Don't eat on the air, Leo.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.960]   No slurbing on it.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.320]   There's been spousal negotiation about which of those I'm allowed to bring to the office.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.360]   That's why I'm allowed to arrive at all.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.240]   You took my nature box!
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.520]   It was packing away.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.760]   And I got, "Where are you going with those?"
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   No, hold on.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.360]   So I get to choose the ones I want.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.640]   Which ones are favorites at home?
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Which ones are favorites?
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   And you don't mind giving it a...
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.640]   I got the plantins.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   Oh, the plantins.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.840]   You've got to take those in?
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.640]   I got to take those.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.040]   Giving some naturebox that I would do in a moment.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.720]   Yeah, it's good stuff.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   It is.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.760]   The art so far is the hard corn corals.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760]   Corn corals.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   Love those.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.800]   I'm not allowed those because I will eat the whole bag.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   No, I'm very...
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.040]   I mean, you put a bag of cheese tools into me.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.040]   That's the big.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   I'll eat the whole thing.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   I'm not doing that.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.040]   I have used no...
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.040]   Just go a little hand...
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.040]   I love the Ziploc.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   The Ziploc helps.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.360]   Now that was native advertising right there.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.440]   Hey, I'm sad.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:16.800]   The Google barge headed for the scrap heap.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.840]   That mysterious barge.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.920]   They were building one here and building one in Portland, Maine.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.120]   The one in Portland, Maine, which was intended to be sailed down to New York City for a luxury
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.360]   showroom for Google hardware is being scrapped.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.960]   They were doing three different barges.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.880]   It was a mystery at first.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.120]   San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.960]   The Portland, Maine one is being...
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.520]   There's 63 containers.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.600]   They're selling the barge off.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.120]   It's worth about $4 million.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.840]   Wow, barges are expensive.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   So I guess it's so amazing that Google has so much money.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.480]   They can just say, "Let's try that."
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.040]   Yeah, let's try that.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   Just kidding.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.040]   Didn't work.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.040]   Didn't like it.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.280]   That was the worst of this idea.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280]   What?
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.120]   Maybe it's a Yahoo barge now.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.600]   Chrome, this is amazing.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   You're going to like this.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.240]   Chrome, 20% market share.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.040]   It's now bigger than Firefox.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.080]   Internet Explorer, of course, is totally dominant.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   58%.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.000]   But that's mostly because it's on Windows and that's...
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.840]   Everybody just uses what they got.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:31.880]   So IE 58, Chrome 20, Firefox 15 Safari, which is Apple only 5.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.960]   And then the rest under 1%.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.400]   Proprietary or undetectable 0.24%.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.200]   Conqueror, which is a Linux browser, 0.5%.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   Oh, Opera.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   Opera under 1%.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.200]   OK, so we're going to put it in there.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.200]   There's still more than 1.99.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.200]   There's still making new versions of that?
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.200]   In fact, it's pretty good software.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.200]   I never thought it was very aesthetic.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.920]   I always felt a little clunky.
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.840]   I never got into it.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.080]   But the technology is good.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.880]   You know, I found something amazing the other day.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.640]   What's that, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   Was it Nature Box?
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.320]   No, not at all.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.800]   That's native advertising.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.240]   I went to copyacerve.com and there's still a copyacerve.com.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240]   What?
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.840]   And reference to-- I guess it was-- oh, by AI, well, but there's
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.240]   reference to customer service and copyacerve.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.080]   Wow.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.640]   Do you remember your copyacerve number?
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.760]   714351134.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.800]   75106, comma 3135.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800]   Gina?
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.720]   I know.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.840]   That's how you know she's younger than us.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.080]   Everybody over--
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.360]   Well--
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.400]   I don't know.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.600]   I think I was late to the internet scene for--
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.320]   I mean, I really wasn't so college until I--
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.720]   Our chat rooms-- all of our chat rooms are putting their--
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.560]   Yeah, yes, they're all.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.520]   They're putting their own.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.880]   So this is what you get.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.320]   Is I just don't have one.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.000]   So you had a copyacerve account?
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.560]   No, I never had a company account.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.400]   Never had one.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.640]   Never had an AOL account either.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.400]   No.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:05.880]   Wow.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.920]   No.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.960]   No.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.200]   Yeah, AOL owns them, so it's really just AOL.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.120]   But it's weird that it's freeze-dried.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.480]   It's brgadoon.com.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.240]   Brgadoon.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.440]   I love it.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.720]   Web centers at netscape.comuserve.com.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.320]   Hey, ladies and gentlemen, let's break out the trumpets.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.000]   Get the horns already.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.800]   No, it's not Gabriel the Archangel
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.280]   returning to destroy the planet Earth.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.520]   It's the Google--
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.520]   The Google changelog.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.520]   The Google changelog.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.160]   And he used Junot-Trapani with the latest from Google.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.640]   All right.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.760]   I just actually switched up the rundown
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.920]   because I decided to lead off with the best one, which
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.600]   is that Google Maps added 3D imaging for both Mars and the moon.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.080]   This is really cool.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.760]   You just have to know how to get to it.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.280]   So you go to maps@google.com and you've
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.360]   got to be using the new Maps.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.440]   So you can't be using that tip I had a few episodes back
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.560]   and I had to switch the old one.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.160]   You've got to use the new Maps.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.360]   And you've got Google Earth or Earth mode enabled.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.920]   If you zoom out, you can zoom out and see the planet Earth.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.360]   But if you zoom out far enough, you'll
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.200]   see Mars and the moon.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.640]   And Earth left.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.920]   That's pretty funny.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.400]   Yeah, can you get directions to, you know, tranquility base?
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.880]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.200]   Yeah, there are definitely items.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:32.880]   Yeah, so there you go.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.360]   So zoom out, zoom, zoom, zoom all the way.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.520]   So who would have gone beyond that part?
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.160]   There you go, bottom left.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.120]   There they are.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.240]   And now, read the imagery of what's that, the moon.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.520]   That's the moon.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.160]   There you go.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.440]   Zoom in.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.400]   That's neat.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.120]   Zoom in.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.960]   Yeah, clearly there are some better pictures
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.760]   in some places than others.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.960]   So Chad, if you like drop a pin there and say,
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.240]   I want directions, will it give you directions?
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.720]   I think you're right.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.040]   I do not believe it will.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:05.800]   But the same thing.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.680]   I'm going to try to build a Saturn V rocket.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.080]   I was trying to figure out if there's a way
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.000]   that I could get the--
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   Oh, there you are.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:12.480]   There you are.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.840]   That's what I wanted.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.480]   Step one, enter your space elevator.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480]   Whee!
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.480]   Whee!
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.120]   You know, we just celebrated the 45th anniversary
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.240]   of Neil Armstrong's been walking.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.120]   I've been watching all the videos and stuff.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.160]   It's so inspiring.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.040]   And I felt like, gosh, we were just-- we were really
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.160]   on the edge of the future there.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.480]   And it's been two years since the Mars rover, right?
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.840]   Yeah, is that really two years?
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.680]   Can you believe that?
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.360]   Can you find curiosity there?
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.680]   Oh, gosh.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.560]   Explore.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.000]   Let me--
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.120]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.680]   Yeah, it's not very-- it's not as searchable as--
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.520]   Yeah, but they got it.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.000]   That's the point.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   --incoitable maps on Earth.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.160]   You wouldn't know where it's at.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.000]   But still really, really neat.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   Love it.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.560]   Yeah, some really cool images.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.040]   Of course, it's kind of quilted.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.840]   I don't know even where to look to find any sort of--
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.840]   I don't know if there's--
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.840]   There's a lot of names here.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.280]   It seems like this is an important spot.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.440]   I guess, yeah, they name all the craters.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.840]   This must have been where the Martian happened.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.280]   Stobbs.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.240]   Stobbs.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:20.720]   Anyway.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.240]   Sorry.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.400]   He was-- where was he?
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.560]   He was on the--
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.720]   Yeah, he was near something.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.880]   --a plane.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.080]   I thought, the problem is I cannot find a place to search.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.640]   Yeah, there isn't really a place to search.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.320]   In this Earth--
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.920]   I loved my favorite Martian when I was a kid.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:36.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.360]   It's a different Martian.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:37.560]   But--
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.920]   This is one of those things that I
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.640]   know that Etta is going to grow up.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.240]   She's going to be doing some book report on the planets.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.720]   And I'm going to be like, look at this.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.200]   It's so cool.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.760]   And she's going to be like, yeah, mom.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.080]   I mean, didn't we always have this?
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.920]   No, we didn't.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.280]   We didn't have this.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.760]   She didn't have this.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.400]   I'm still telling Gina, Etta is going
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:02.960]   to be into loots and middle ages.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.680]   I'll admit, that's my prediction.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.120]   She's going to get rid of all technology
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.200]   and think that it's just ridiculous.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.400]   Hey, End user UK wonders if they blur the Martian's faces.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   No.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:17.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.880]   It's a guy-- I hear that the Martians are having some sort
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.440]   of privacy issues.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.520]   A right to be here.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.440]   There is a hexagonal storm on Saturn, folks.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.680]   Have you seen that?
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.840]   It's a storm that's bigger than Earth.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.120]   And it's a hexagon?
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.040]   It's a hexagon.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:34.800]   Yes, it's on--
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.560]   That has to be man-made.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.080]   It's pretty much done.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.680]   That has to be man-made.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.080]   Nature abhors a hexagon.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.160]   No, it doesn't.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.280]   There's hexagons all over nature.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:46.800]   Really?
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.200]   Yeah, just look up.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.760]   Look it up.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.600]   Saturn is actually gone.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.480]   It's a very common crystalline formation.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.200]   And what do we-- don't forget about these.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.360]   Wow, that is quite hexagonal, however.
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.520]   Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.160]   Wow, that's kind of hard to imagine that just spontaneously
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.560]   happening that way.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.480]   Wow.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.040]   Wow.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.920]   What did they say about that?
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.520]   There would be hundreds of years old.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:14.880]   I think--
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.920]   Well, this was based in December 2013.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.240]   It's old.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.880]   Why isn't anybody saying anything about this?
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.200]   Quick get Adam Curry on the horn.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:31.360]   I think-- we haven't even talked about the asteroid.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.320]   Rosetta.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.720]   Well, that's not the asteroid's name.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.280]   It's got some boring old name.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.640]   But Rosetta is the European rocket that's there visiting.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.280]   The Twitter account.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.640]   Oh, yeah, I saw it on the rundown.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.680]   ESA_Rosetta.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.280]   Yeah, because it's been pretty neat to watch it as it gets
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.840]   closer and closer to this comment.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:55.920]   It really is.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.000]   The comet's name is 67P.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.520]   So that's why we don't get excited about it.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.960]   That's neat.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.080]   Yeah, ESA, because it's the European Space Agency.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.160]   Rosetta Mission.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:15.360]   William Shatner's tweeting.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.240]   Oh, he has--
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.080]   He's having a comment.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:18.960]   I love that.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:22.320]   When you get William Shatner talking to the commander
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.440]   of the ISS and things like that, it's like, wow.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.920]   We do live in the future.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.000]   It's fantastic.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.560]   That's it.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.760]   Big space rock.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.680]   Well, I want more app reviews out of Shatner.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:37.000]   Are there Shatner apps?
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.880]   Shatner wrote a whole piece about how he hated
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.800]   his new analytics app.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.480]   You know, I feel like he actually wrote that.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.640]   But it couldn't be, right?
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.000]   It must have been his social media guy who wrote it under his name.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:48.520]   Yeah?
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.560]   And yet that would be such a massive misrepresentation
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.000]   that he must have written.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.640]   So on his tumbler.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.560]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.200]   It kind of had his tone.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.040]   Yeah, it doesn't listen to me.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.680]   Yeah, it did.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:04.720]   Because it also had the George Taked joke in it.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.440]   Oh, right.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.120]   But of course, his social media guy would do that.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.520]   And by the way, I was so devastated
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.640]   to learn George Taked doesn't post his own stuff.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.520]   Oh, he has some.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.320]   Not all.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.560]   He's got a team.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.240]   Oh, my.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.240]   So he's reviewing the Facebook app,
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.640]   which only he gets to see that's for celebrities.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.440]   And he hated it.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.160]   He thought it was really stupid.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.240]   So he says, I have to have both apps.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:38.440]   Shatner Speaks is the name of his tumbler log.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.320]   Yeah, it would be a pretty big misrepresentation.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.040]   It would be.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.560]   I mean, it says these posts are my own.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.720]   They should not be considered anything,
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.960]   but my opinion of views.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.840]   OK, well, there you go.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.240]   What happened is that?
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.160]   Wow.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.360]   That's very cool.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.640]   Facebook mentions versus Facebook pages app.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.000]   I want to talk and compare an app that most of you
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.120]   don't have access to Facebook mentions compared to the pages
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.960]   app that anyone has Facebook page can download and use.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.120]   I found out about mentions from a banner ad that
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.120]   was at the top of my Facebook account earlier this week.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.480]   And it was a customized with my icon on an iPhone.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.640]   So I downloaded it.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.960]   It says, William Shatner, James Tiberius Kirk.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.000]   This is like a full blown review like you
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.760]   would write for a magazine.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.400]   It's a life hacker screen.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:23.920]   Screenshot.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.920]   Screenshot.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.320]   A shotner took a turn at tech journalism.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320]   So awesome.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:30.840]   For opinion.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.880]   Bill, if you're watching, please get in touch with us.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.480]   Let us know.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:34.840]   Did you--
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.360]   I'm on the show.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.280]   Did you write this?
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.960]   Come on the show.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.640]   He says, I'm not quite sure why Facebook released this app
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.000]   for quote celebrities.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.400]   It seems to be ill-conceived.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.160]   I'll probably use it to post to my Facebook when I'm on my phone.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.680]   But it doesn't allow for mail or groups.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.640]   I'll continue to use my regular Facebook app,
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.080]   as well as the Pages app, which means that Shatner and Zuckerberg
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.480]   Lexus has three Facebook apps on this phone.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.040]   Gosh, that's amazing.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.720]   All right.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.760]   I can finish off the change log.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.120]   There isn't much left.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:03.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.120]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.120]   Sorry.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.620]   Wait.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:05.120]   Sorry.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:05.600]   No, no, that's OK.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.120]   We really get sidetracked there.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:08.620]   Sorry.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.000]   I brought up the Shatner review.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.160]   And I actually think we talked about this a little bit earlier.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.680]   But just to make sure that everyone knows,
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.600]   the formerly Nexus only Google Now launcher
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.920]   is now out for all Android 4.1 and up devices.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.160]   So this is the Google Now launcher that came out when KitKat was
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.440]   released on the Nexus 5.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.400]   And it's my default launcher.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.720]   Leo, I know that it's not your default launcher.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.760]   I really like it because you swipe over to the left
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.120]   and you get Google Now and it has some different interfaces
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:37.760]   for widgets.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:43.160]   And it has the voice activated Google search.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.120]   Really, really nice.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.200]   So if you didn't have a Nexus or your phone hadn't
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.400]   updated, you can go to the Play Store now and try it out.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.800]   And yeah, it's a pretty nice launcher.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.040]   You know what's great about that is it means that Jeff can go
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.200]   from his Nexus 5 to the OnePlus and--
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   And have a good launcher.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.520]   He'll be the same launcher.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.680]   I've never changed the launcher.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:02.640]   How do I change the launcher?
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.840]   I don't even know.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:06.640]   Oh my god.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.720]   Actually, it's automatic.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.360]   If you download the launcher, the next time you press the
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.480]   home button, it'll say, ooh, would you like me to launch
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.040]   the launcher or Google Now?
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:16.560]   And then you--
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:23.160]   But my Nexus 5 is automatically on the Google Now launcher.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:23.720]   Right.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.720]   Yes.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.560]   Right.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.080]   So on the OnePlus 1, you'll download the Google Now
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.880]   launcher from the Play Store because that's going to default
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.080]   to Trebuchet, which is the Cyan Engine 1, which I switched
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:34.960]   the Google Now launcher.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.280]   But just download the Google Now launcher.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.160]   You press the home button.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.680]   It'll say, which launcher?
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.560]   And just tap it and say, ooh, is.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.120]   So there'll be a little bit of configuration.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.200]   But you only have to do that once.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.040]   You can do it.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.440]   Entreprenely, I know where you want.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.240]   That's enough, by the way.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.920]   This just means we have to have lunch.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:48.440]   That's all.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.360]   It can be set up one.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.920]   It's another nice thing about Cyan Engine because unlike the
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:59.360]   regular Android, do you have home, personalization for home,
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.920]   in the settings?
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.680]   So you can also just go to home in your settings, and it'll
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.520]   show whatever launches you have installed, and you can
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.360]   pick which one you want to use.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.360]   So it's now a setting.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.320]   That's something that is not part of the regular Android.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.880]   That's something many, many different versions have.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.680]   HTC's Sense does that as well.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:18.160]   Nice.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.000]   So that makes it very easy to choose.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.040]   But you get offered it right away as soon as you download it.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:23.560]   Thanks.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:24.560]   Mm-hmm.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:24.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.120]   Yep.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.880]   Couple of quick Gmail changes.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.520]   First, Gmail adds an easy unsubscribe button next to a
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.520]   sender's address in your email.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.600]   So if you're subscribed to an emailing list, they used to
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.200]   have some subscribe button.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.920]   They used to have this link, but it was kind of buried in the
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:41.920]   headers.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.520]   You had to expand the headers if I remember correctly.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.120]   Well, now it's like right next to the sender, the top of your
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.120]   email.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.320]   That's got to piss off some people, huh?
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:58.520]   If the email, if the sender includes an unsubscribe link and a
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.920]   promotion, social or forms message, Gmail will include that
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.320]   unsubscribe link at the top of the message right next to the
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.320]   sender.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.320]   There are a five-year email address.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.520]   I just came from this address.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.520]   I got to type it in.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.320]   I had one the other day to do the CAPTCHA for me.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.920]   Like a robot is going unsubscribing.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   Jorks.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:15.920]   Really?
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.240]   You must be a robot unsubscribed at this list.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.160]   Why would you ever want to leave the number one internet
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.920]   service provider in America?
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.120]   You must be a robot.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.840]   Wow.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.800]   That's really, that's just low.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.680]   That's like native advertising.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.680]   It's true.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:36.680]   It's just low.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680]   It is.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.080]   And finally, last Gmail changes that Gmail is finally starting
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.800]   to recognize email addresses with non-Latin characters in them.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.800]   So that's starting now.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.360]   Gmail and shortly Calendar will recognize addresses that contain
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.120]   accent that are non-Latin characters.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.600]   So accent that are non-Latin characters are supported
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.640]   officially in the email protocol, but not a whole lot of
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.880]   service providers support it.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.640]   So it makes it essentially impossible to use.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.160]   That means I could now have an emoji.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.040]   I could be Leo's steaming pile of poo at Gmail.com.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.040]   There you go.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.040]   Is that right?
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.800]   Because that's in the Unicode.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.040]   So the problem is you can't create an account with those
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.040]   characters yet on Gmail, but it means that Gmail users can send
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.440]   emails to accounts that do have access to the characters,
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.840]   non-Latin characters, and receive emails from.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.000]   And this is just kind of the first step.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.960]   And Google says that in the future, they're going to make it
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.720]   possible for you to create Gmail accounts with non-Latin
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.520]   characters in them.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.040]   So you can be Leo's steaming pile of poop, just not writing
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.080]   them down this.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.240]   Not right this second.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240]   So it's a nice first step.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.720]   And Google's saying, hey, somebody's got to do it.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.840]   So we're going to support this.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.080]   And we're going to continue to build support into it.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.680]   And hopefully, once that domino follows, others will
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.440]   follow suit.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.680]   And that's all I got.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:54.840]   And that, my friends, play the drum slowly.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.440]   Is the Google change log?
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.640]   I have a problem with Gmail.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   I've been having it a lot lately.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.640]   Gina, maybe you can help me with this.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.480]   It doesn't load.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.280]   I go to it, and it partly loads.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:05.960]   And then I have a blank.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.040]   You see this, Chad?
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.880]   This happens to me all the time.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   Whoa.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.800]   All the time, like more than half the time.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.280]   Is there something I've done bad?
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:21.440]   I click the inbox, loading.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.040]   That's it.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:22.840]   Are you using that?
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.840]   Whoa, wacky.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.320]   Whoa, wacky.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.440]   Is this Chrome?
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.320]   No, this is just Chrome Chrome.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.800]   Is it the app, or is it just a web page?
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.760]   Well, let me try the app.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.800]   I think the same thing happens when you do the app.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.240]   Oh, the offline app, you mean--
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.360]   No, no, it works.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.840]   No, it's all sort of online.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.280]   It works.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.560]   So you know where you go to the grid,
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.240]   and it shows you your apps.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.680]   That way worked.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.360]   But just going to gmail.com didn't.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.800]   That's interesting.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.720]   Interesting.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.640]   I wonder if I maybe have some security setting.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.520]   You did.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.640]   I might have some weird security setting.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.800]   You fixed-- thank you, tech guy, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:03.800]   You are my new IT hero.
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.160]   Well done.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.520]   There used to be a quick load lab,
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.160]   and it does not appear to exist anymore.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.320]   I may have some last pass stuff on here, or something.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.120]   Last pass, or some sort of security setting.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.400]   Because that's an Ajax load, I'm pretty sure.
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.840]   So it's a synchronously loading the messages in the inbox,
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.680]   and maybe something's blocking it.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.160]   I have--
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.840]   Is it happening just on this computer, or on the all your computers?
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.880]   Home to everywhere.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.880]   Oh.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.120]   I have a stock Google theme.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:39.000]   Maybe I'll try a different one.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.880]   By the way, they're telling me that stock Android now
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:47.080]   does have that home setting in the Settings menu.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.280]   It's called Home.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:48.840]   I wouldn't know.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.040]   Go look in your Nexus 5.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.120]   Look at your Nexus 5.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:51.800]   Go to the settings.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.400]   See if there's a home in.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.400]   Oh, no.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.400]   Oh, no.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.840]   That's how you change your own.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.320]   I was looking for launcher.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.160]   You were looking for launcher.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:32:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.920]   No, and I don't use an ad blocker, because I
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.960]   believe in looking at ads as often as possible.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.880]   Wikipedia pages taken down-- well, not pages.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.920]   Just the links in the right to be forgotten.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.920]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.200]   I'll just have a--
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.960]   Everybody getting to sit back and relax.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.400]   I see that here.
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.320]   We just record something.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:26.360]   This thing is spreading.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.640]   This thing is dangerous.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.640]   Just horrible.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.640]   You're up.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.640]   You're wrong.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.640]   Leave it there.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.640]   Jimmy.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.640]   Wait, wait.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   Jimmy Wales, not too happy about this.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   You.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.640]   Jimmy Wales, it's on the Google Right to Be Forgotten Council
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.640]   of Advisors.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.640]   Ah.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.640]   Mm.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.640]   So what happened?
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.640]   Wiki Media uploaded copies of the takedown requests,
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.640]   and then those were removed via Right to Be Forgotten.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640]   Is that what happened?
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.640]   Wiki Media.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.640]   Wikipedia has uploaded the most recent notices
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.640]   that got from Google, all of which were removed from search
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   results during the European Right to Be Forgotten laws.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.640]   And these are removal notices for Wikipedia pages?
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:04.640]   Links?
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.640]   Yes.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.640]   OK.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.640]   Links removed very widely from a picture of a man playing guitar
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.640]   to a page about Renato Valanzkaza, Valanzka.
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.640]   So the source URLs are notified.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.640]   I was confused about this.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.640]   So Wiki Media is notified when someone requests that--
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.640]   Google has been notifying people.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.640]   Oh, Google has been.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.640]   I gave up that.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:26.640]   Yeah, by the way.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:28.640]   This is from Wikipedia.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   This is the notice.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.640]   This is from the Netherlands, I think.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.640]   Due to a request under Data Protection Law in Europe,
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.640]   we're no longer able to show one or more pages from your site
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.640]   in our search results.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.640]   And it responds to some search queries for names
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.640]   or other personal identifiers.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.640]   The only results in European versions of Google are affected.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.640]   No action is required from you.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640]   This is--
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:54.640]   Great thing is, the Wiki Media blog post points to a Wiki
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.640]   media entry for Memory Hole.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.640]   Good.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.640]   Jeez, Louise, is this broken?
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.640]   Ah.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   Jimmy Wales' statement on this is, I think, very echoed somewhat
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.640]   what you say as well.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.640]   He says, "History is a human right.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.640]   And one of the worst things a person can do is attempt to use
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.640]   force to silence another."
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.640]   Amen, brother Jimmy.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.640]   I've been saying this for quite some time.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.640]   He's sent in Twitter recently, too.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   There is no right to be forgotten, but there is a right to
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.640]   remember.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.640]   Mmm.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.640]   Like it.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:33.640]   I like it.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:34.640]   Yeah, I feel a lot.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.640]   Look at credit for saying that.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   Now, I said it before he did, but never mind it.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.640]   It's all for cause.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.640]   Are you following the Robo panic?
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.640]   Elon Musk starts it by saying, "Ayes could be more dangerous
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:48.640]   than nukes."
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.640]   We've actually interviewed a couple of people, including a
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.640]   guy, I mean, I think James Barrett, who wrote a book that's
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   saying it could be our last invention, because once machines
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.640]   get as smart as humans and then start designing themselves,
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.640]   they're just going to say, "Hey, we're just like a mess.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:07.640]   Wipe those carbon-based things off the face of the earth."
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:14.640]   And then Mark Andreessen says, "Oh, don't worry about taking
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:15.640]   your jobs."
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.640]   Well, as one of many things artificial intelligence could
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   do.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.640]   Right, but the robots computer's playing your job is no,
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:24.640]   won't he says.
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.640]   Then Uniswear Ventures Albert Fanger, who's very smart,
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.640]   came back and said, "Sorry, I got to disagree with you, Mark."
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   And Mark tweeted that.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.640]   And then the New York Times did a whole roundup of people who
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   are and are not worried about robots.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.640]   Are you, let's get on the record.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   Are you worried about robots, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.640]   No.
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:46.640]   No.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.640]   No.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   No.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:37:00.120]   you worried about robots Gina t'appani? No. I'm not worried. I want a robot now. I can't
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.600]   get out of six. I'll just worry about me worry. Oh yeah, Leo I have to give you
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.200]   my five minute warning. We're done. We're done. We'll just get you tip in a second. I
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:11.460]   do want to point out that a Microsoft tip has led to the rest of the man in Pennsylvania
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:19.580]   for sharing child porn. So this just came in not sure but it was from Microsoft's
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:25.220]   live.com email accounts and this happened in the end of the month last month. So it's
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:31.620]   not just as we some surmised it's not just Gmail. We're going to come back with your
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:37.180]   tip of the week in just a minute Gina t'appani but first a word from personal capital. We
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:44.220]   all have this problem. Some of us more than others. If you are aging, you've got to prepare
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:48.820]   for your future. You've got to manage your investments. You've got to manage your money

[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:10.180]   you may well be paying way too much for that retirement whether you're overpaying in the
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:15.740]   mutual fund fees or for advice. Personal capital can help you. They can bring all your

[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.940]   And now somebody asked me, well how do they make money because there's no ads and all
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:37.860]   of this stuff. It's really simple. Some but not all. You have to have a net worth of a
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.700]   certain amount. I can't remember what it is. They will call you and say, would you like
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:47.460]   to use our certified financial planner for a fee? That certified financial planner is
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:52.580]   independent. They do not sell on commission. They are not only certified. They are really
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:57.980]   good and you can decline it. So this stuff is free, absolutely free. And most of us will
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:04.500]   never get a call like that. It is really great stuff. Bill Harris founded this. We interviewed

[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.540]   your tip of the week.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:39.300]   My tip of the week is to check out the new four square app for Android or iOS. It just
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:43.020]   dropped today. I'm a big four square fan and I think, you know, for a long time, four
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:47.660]   square was the check in app. It is no longer the check in app. It's now, think of it like
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:54.660]   a smarter Yelp. It's a discovery app for finding places around things that you love.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.820]   It's got a lot of data about people who you know on various networks or contacts. You
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:06.140]   can follow experts. So, for example, it might suggest Jeff to me as a Chipotle expert and
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:10.540]   I can follow him and I can see his tips and I can discover places. I think it was last
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:14.540]   episode or episode before where I talked about Google Maps new explore feature, which
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:20.940]   is pretty good. I really like the way that four square has implemented this. This new
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:27.140]   app is a completely re-imagined kind of reinvention of their app. Took the check ins out and just
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:32.580]   did a really nice job of discovery and helping you find places that you like based on what
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:38.060]   you like. So, you go in and you say, "I really like tacos. I really like, you know, crepes
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:43.820]   and I really like awesome playgrounds for my daughter and the recommendations are fantastic
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:47.220]   and it really surfaces great tips and I'm really, I'm really digging it. So, if you haven't
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.420]   looked at four square in a mile and check it out, check it out.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:53.300]   They've got a potential problem because you're in a big city, so you're going to find stuff.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:58.500]   But I'm in Petaluma and it's not very good at finding stuff and that's because, you know,
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:03.900]   people have to use four square and check in and I guess people haven't. And by the way,
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:10.060]   I added tastes and everything. So, this and of course, as they've moved check outs out
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:13.620]   of four square and into swarm, the question is, are they going to reduce the amount of
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.620]   data they're going to get from people? So, there's the first recommendation after all
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.420]   of this is Laguna Is Brewing Company for Nightlife.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:23.500]   Yeah, that's a bummer. I mean, I certainly noticed that four square was way better in
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:27.900]   New York and San Francisco and it wasn't San Diego, for example. And it does have to
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.860]   do with whether or not your friends are using the app. So, I'll definitely.
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:32.940]   And there she goes.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:37.900]   It's just a matter of like, you're traveling to a big city, you know, and you know, you
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:41.180]   want to follow your friend who lives in San Francisco and see what their tips are. I mean,
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.300]   it's worth it just for that.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:47.220]   I use it and I use swarm too to check in because I want to keep that database going.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:50.780]   Yeah, at this point, it's like, it's a life log. I just want to remember where it was.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.100]   Yeah, it's really nice. You know, that plus time hop, you know, is pretty awesome. So,
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:42:02.860]   to remember your number of the your temp, somebody somebody at work is turning your
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.420]   internet connection down slowly, Gina, so that you get out of here at three o'clock,
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:10.540]   six o'clock. Real quickly, what's your number? In fact, if you want to go now, Gina, you're
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:13.500]   done. So, I don't have to. I don't you can take off anytime.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:17.140]   All right, cool. Thanks, guys. I'm gonna take a look at you next week.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:23.220]   We'll go off early hour now. I want to mention the opensignal.com is doing what I've long
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:28.740]   wanted to do, which is to put up reports on hotel Wi-Fi. Oh, great.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:32.980]   image of travelers. Yeah. So, they have a report out about about not only that, but
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:38.420]   they have a report out about how Google Starbucks Wi-Fi is better than 18 D starbucks Wi-Fi has
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.420]   been and other things. But that's not my number, Leo. I want to have a number. Go ahead and
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:45.540]   show this. So, there's an app you can download on Android.
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:50.260]   This is actually not just Wi-Fi. You can see which carrier is best in your neighborhood.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:43:01.180]   All kinds of this is much more. So Verizon is 23% worse than US average in Petaluma. Wow.
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:08.180]   That would be a bad network. Wow. The app too is here. I just I just checked my connection
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:12.660]   on on here at school, which obviously pretty good today because nobody's here. I'm the
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:19.900]   only guy here. And and it's God's work to keep these guys on us. So, I had, you know,
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.940]   they did an earlier report and I said, well, I wish you no hotels. They said coming soon.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:29.220]   So they tweeted today that they've just done their hotel support. This is great. But I
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:35.220]   have one more number for you, Leo. Okay. Just to drive you, Betty. Three main stars of
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:38.500]   your least favorite show, Big Bang, are now getting a million dollars per episode.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:43.060]   Good. No, they deserve that. No, I have no problem with that. I think actors, performers
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:48.900]   should be paid, exorbitant amounts of money so that they can fuel the US economy. Yes.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:53.300]   No, I like that. That's fine. I'm not I don't mean that they shouldn't get paid. I just
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:44:01.140]   I'm not going to laugh at them. I think they're great. I'm like an open signal. I am really
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:05.060]   liking this. Yeah, I've got great. This is a great website. Everybody should know. If you go to the
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:11.700]   report, Oh, geez, it's on Android and iPhone too, by the way, you can download that. Go to the
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:18.660]   report that's on the rundown. They also track the cost of the hotel room versus the cost of the
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:21.540]   Wi-Fi. Now they're fine. I thought it was going to be the opposite. I thought it was going to be
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:26.420]   contrary. The cheaper the room, the better the Wi-Fi. Yeah, apparently not the more expensive
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:31.220]   room, the better the Wi-Fi. That's interesting. That's an interesting graph. And what percentage
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:38.420]   of your room, like if the Wi-Fi is $23 a day, what percentage of your total hotel bill that is?
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:46.180]   My pick is wallpaper. I know boring, silly, but I happen to like having good wallpaper,
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:50.740]   not just on my computer, but on my smartphone. When you have a phone with 5.5 inch screen,
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.940]   wallpaper is actually a pretty important consideration. And a lot of times, it's just some static image.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:45:02.580]   But the guys who do a chain fire, the guys who do a super SU have done, and by the way,
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:06.580]   be careful with wallpaper apps. It's a very common way to get malware in your system. This
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:12.580]   is not because it's a very reputable company. They've done something that pulls from 500px,
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:19.140]   which is my favorite website for photos. You can update the images. You can choose the categories,
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:23.860]   and there are quite a few categories on here. You can say whether it's the editorial pick or just
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:31.220]   the most popular. I'm choosing animals, city and architecture, landscapes, nature, and underwater,
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:35.540]   because I like those kinds of things. It'll download these, and you can set an updated interview.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:40.180]   So every five minutes, I can have my wallpaper change every five minutes, every 10 minutes,
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:43.540]   every day. And they're beautiful. I like your Q&A SFW images.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:50.100]   Yeah. Well, I, yeah, what the hell? If somebody's breast shows up on here, I'll just have to live with
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:56.020]   it. But these are beautiful images. They really good look great on the desktop.
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:01.940]   And it's nice to have different images all the time. So just this is really sweet app. It's free.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:07.060]   They have in-app purchases. The only difference is the in-app purchase caches the images for a week
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:13.460]   instead of one day. It's called 500 fire paper. And it's from ChainFire. It really does a great
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:18.500]   job. And I'm very happy. 500px has such great images. If you use the editorial picks, you're
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.580]   just going to have stunning images. Oh, it also resizes it to fit your screen exactly. So
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:24.820]   you're always going to get high quality images on your desktop.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:30.580]   I like my picture a big bin. Yeah. That's nice. But see, you could have a travel
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.140]   section and then you'll have all different pictures all the time.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:38.100]   I don't want to change this. Oh, that's right. You're adverse to change. You're change a verse.
[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:45.220]   Jeff, open the box. Okay. I'm going to open the box. Come on. You're going to love it.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:50.420]   I'm going to do it. And by the way, if you don't and you don't get an RMA, I will be very glad to
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.500]   buy it off of you. Oh, plenty of people want to buy it. Yeah. I don't think you're in any
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:47:00.180]   trouble at all going back to the Nexus 5 because this is selling for a premium on eBay for like
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:05.860]   500 bucks. You're going to make money on it. Pull that big red tab. I'm going to do it.
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:08.900]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York. And that means
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:14.500]   there's some very lucky students there. You can also find his work at buzzmachine.com. Great author.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:19.940]   His books include public parts. What would Google do? And the Amazon single Gutenberg,
