[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Today is November 7, 2012, and I am not Leo Le Porte.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Leo is off cruising the world, so I'm standing in for him.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He's not in studio today. And neither is our friend Jeff Jarvis,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   who's usually with us. Jeff was also supposed to be traveling the
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   world today, but he's actually at home in New Jersey, stuck without
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   power and internet connectivity. So our thoughts go out to Jeff.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   We hope he gets powered up and connected again soon, because we
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   miss him. But we've got a great panel today.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I'm really excited. We have In Studio Aaron Newcomb, who is a host
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   of the source show, The Source and Works for Oracle.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Hey, Aaron. Hey, good to see you.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Good to see you too. Thanks so much for being in studio today.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Just in case my Skype goes out. We got someone on the front.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And we also have with us a friend of mine from here in San Diego,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Mitch Wagner, who's the editor-in-chief of Internet
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Evolution.com. Hey, Mitch.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Hi, Gina. How you doing? Good.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   How are things in your part of San Diego?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   A little foggy at the moment. Are you getting the fog yet?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   No, it's beautiful and sunny here.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Good, good, good. Really thrilled you guys are here today.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And thanks to chat room and to Chad for getting this set up.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   So I don't know. Is everyone sick of hearing about the election?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yesterday was the US presidential or the election in general here in
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   the United States.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why didn't no one tell me this?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I know. I can't believe it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm patient about it. It was just so difficult to find information
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   about it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So I don't know if you guys saw this, but Sergey Brando,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Google posted on his Google+ page a call for the candidates to
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   basically govern his independence to take down the party,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   the two-party system.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   He said that he was dreading today's elections.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He posted this yesterday. Not because of who might win or lose,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   but because of the party system and that his vote -- he doesn't
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   feel like his vote counts as much.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This is even though I think Bryn personally has donated $30,000
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   to the DNC and $5,000 to President Obama's campaign.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Did you think that this was weird, that Bryn posted to his
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Google+ page after, you know,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   trying to change our election system here?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I mean, personally, I was like, "Woo-hoo, right on."
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I think the real point is that it's really come down to just a
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   handful of states, right, the so-called battleground states,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   which is what he was talking about.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And it's like, you know what, if you live in a solid red or a
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   solid blue state, you may as well do something different because
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   your vote's not going to matter as much.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So, and he picked on Alaska, I think, for some reason, just maybe
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   because of the population difference.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   But, you know, he was saying, I think, that his vote counted
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   $1.90 at as much as an Alaskan vote.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So, I thought that was pretty interesting.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But, I mean, I think that, you know, his sentiment was right on.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I mean, it would be nice to have more diversity in politics in the
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   United States.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So, I'm just curious, too, though, what you guys thought about him
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   in his position as CEO.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I mean, should CEOs be talking about that kind of stuff?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Do you think that was kosher or okay to do?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Sure, why not?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I mean, it's kind of in line.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Google's always been pretty outspoken about their politics.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I thought it was interesting that he chose to do a Google+ post.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I feel like he has so many other things that he, you know,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   so much, so many other things that he could do being the position
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   that he's in to really kind of make this change.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   What do you think, Mitch?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I think, as to the issue, whether it's appropriate, he cares deeply
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   about the subject.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   He wrote about it.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I don't think it probably didn't take up much of his time.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I think his perspective is politically naive, though.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   George Washington couldn't get rid of political parties in the U.S.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I don't know why he thinks he should be able to.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I don't think getting rid of political parties is necessarily
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   a good thing, although I do agree we need more diversity of them
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and more diversity of opinion.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And there are also sound reasons why we have this weird
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   disproportional voting system.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It basically keeps candidates, it forces candidates to focus on a
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   lot of states and not just stick at the population centers.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Right.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Well, it was interesting.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   How did you, how were you guys track the election yesterday?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Were you watching cable news, were you online, were you on Twitter,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   were you on Facebook?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Did you have a preferred channel to get your news and figure out
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   what was going to happen?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I was using Twitter and basically all the social networks,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   well, was it work because it was just easier to switch back and forth,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   getting some work done and then, oh, yeah, let me see what's going on.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Okay, fine.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But then later on in the afternoon, like around dinner time,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   we just turned on the TV because we're eating dinner.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Easy.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You know, so that's, we did, we did kind of all of the above.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.240]   I was looking at, I was looking at Twitter, Twitter, um, five
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.000]   thirty eight dot com on the times, Huffington Post map.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   That said, it all went by really fast if you're on the west coast.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   You know, you're working, you're working, you're working, you know,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   things really going to happen till eight p.m. local time.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And then like, seems like two hours later, it was all over.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It was kind of fast.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It was kind of amazing that Obama basically accepted his victory
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   on Twitter before he did his acceptance speech.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And he had one of the most retweeted tweets of all time,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   beating out Justin Bieber.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I think it was like 500,000 retweets.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It was just a pretty simple tweet.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He just said, four more years.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And it was a picture of him in Michelle Obama.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I thought that was pretty amazing that this campaign, this election really
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   happened so much on Twitter.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Twitter was going, my tweet.coms are going by so fast.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I could barely keep up with them.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I think one thing that's interesting is I think the news we've seen
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   over the last 10 days has really vindicated a lot of Twitter's media embedding.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I mean, you saw so many striking pictures of the hurricane last week
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and then that picture of Michelle Obama and Barack Obama hugging each other was also very
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   striking and moving.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And that's just right there in the Twitter stream.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You don't have to link out to it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   It's a very small difference, but I think it's a powerful one.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And Twitter stayed up.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Which was impressive and happy making.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   But yeah, all things do you ran a story saying Twitter kills the great white
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   fail well.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Finally.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I don't know what they're doing with all their bandwidth today.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Do you guys think TV has gotten worse at covering breaking news since social media has come on the
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   scene or?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Well, I know I can tell you I hate it when they get there.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Now we're going to bring on our social media expert.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   What's Twitter saying?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.920]   And I think I was watching, I was at ABC and they had Katie Kirk on and she was doing
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   the social scene, you know, and it's just like, really, I know that.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   I can see I've got it right here.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   You know, I just don't understand why they all feel like they have to do that.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   I mean, is that really drawing in an audience for them when they do that?
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   I don't know.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.320]   It's like, why can't people just look at their smartphone or look at their laptop that's
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   in front of them?
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   It's annoying.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.440]   Where I was going with this is that Twitter seems to be ideally suited for these little
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.800]   breaking news events, which usually tend to have little bursts of information coming
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.560]   out every few minutes or every hour or so.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.200]   TV seems obligated to fill the dead time with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.480]   You know, let's go talk to a hurricane victim and find out how he feels about his house
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   blowing down.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480]   Oh, he's unhappy.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   Twitter is better.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.200]   You know, you can keep it going out of the corner of your eye.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.320]   If something's happening, you can focus in.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.800]   And if something's not happening, you can play a game or do some work.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.560]   Yeah, I completely agree.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.440]   I mean, and I think we've talked about it before.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   I mean, I think we've talked about it.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   I mean, I think we've talked about it.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   I think we've talked about it.

[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   I think we've talked about it.

[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.200]   I think that there's a few things, the keys that, from what I've heard, are the big ticket
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.440]   things that they look for.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.160]   I don't see anything wrong with having the app in the marketplace.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.920]   The interesting thing for me is what if this was turned on its head?
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.800]   This wouldn't be an issue.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.840]   If iPhone Maps had been around for years and years and people were using them in the Google
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:55.120]   marketplace, the same thing wouldn't be true.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:02.560]   There would be no worry about this, as long as the very basic things are met for the Google
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   Play Store.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.160]   Right, because the Google Play Store doesn't have pre-approvals, you mean?
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   It's so much more open.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.080]   It's so much easier to get your app in the marketplace.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.560]   It would just be really easy to do.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.800]   Because of the way Apple handles their app store, no matter what you think about it,
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.960]   I agree that there will be some delays in getting it approved.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.920]   I feel like as an iOS developer, you go into it knowing that by doing it, you're
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   going to be able to do it.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.040]   By developing for the iOS platform, you're taking the risk that Apple is going to take
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.360]   issue with something in your app or isn't going to approve it for whatever reason and
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.080]   the reason sort of change and they're sometimes pretty opaque.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.160]   For Google, should Google put use resources and put them toward issuing a Google Maps
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   app?
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.320]   I think that they should.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   But it's a big risk.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.120]   It sounds like Google and Apple are in constant communication about this kind of thing.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.160]   Apple blocked Google Voice for a long time and then the FTC launched it in inquiry and
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.600]   then suddenly it was approved.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.560]   The Google Search app, which has the voice capability similar to Siri, also just got
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   approved.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.400]   John Gruber wrote a post saying that that was curious timing.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.120]   It was right after forced all left Apple that Google Voice Search app got approved and that
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.720]   had been held in the queue for a while.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.680]   I don't know if there's anything scandalous going on there.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:24.840]   Yeah, I mean channeling the missing spirit of Jeff Jarvis here, Google wants Apple wants,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.280]   I'm sorry, Google wants signals.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.120]   So how people are using a map to be able to get the Maps app on the iPhone will then
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.360]   be signals of where people are using the iPhone that go back to Google when they use
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   Google Maps app.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.360]   So of course Google is going to try to get its Maps app on the iPhone.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.320]   I don't see how they can not.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   And then--
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   Well, wants it there, but does Apple want to allow it?
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320]   Right.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.920]   But don't you think it's an Apple's best interest?
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.080]   I mean, they want people to buy their phone, right?
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.040]   And there's been so much news over the map kerfuffle.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.080]   Don't you think that would be a good reason for them to approve it right away?
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   Just kind of quell that.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.400]   I mean, I know they have the apology and stuff, but I think this is really a big deal for consumers
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.960]   when they hear stories about something that's as commonplace now, at least on the Android
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.040]   platform as maps and navigation, not working on the iPhone.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.360]   Well, I'm not going to buy an iPhone, then I'm going to buy an Android device.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.040]   So it seems like it's in their best interest.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.400]   Now, of course, that's all speculation.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.640]   But it seems like the theory here, the logic of this, is that it would be in their best
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.720]   interest to allow Google to get their app on the phone as quickly as possible.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.160]   Even though they will be losing signal, they still have happy consumers.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   Right.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   Right.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   Go ahead, Matt.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:41.000]   That is a really interesting line you've raised.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.040]   People basically decided that controlling this key application was more important than
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.400]   the short-term loss in customer satisfaction.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:02.280]   They felt that every phone to be successful needs are a reliable mapping app, and that
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.240]   put them in, beholden to Google.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.840]   So they felt like it was more important to them to be not to beholden to Google and put
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.760]   their own app on it.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:19.080]   So that would be an argument against them approving the Google Maps app.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.800]   However, this all happened when Scott Forest all was running software, and Scott Forest
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   all was gone.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.040]   So I wonder if we would see any different line of thought happening now.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.600]   Ultimately, I think it would be crazy of Apple to reject the Google Maps app.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.760]   But candidly, I think it was crazy of them to replace it in the first place.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.200]   It's in their best interest to make that built-in Apple Maps work really well.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.160]   I mean, it did.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.880]   And I think that they launched it thinking that it was going to work really well, and
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.800]   then it didn't.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.040]   But that whole-- and I agree that Tim Cook's apologies, specifically directing consumers
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.720]   to go to maps.google.com and Safari and add shortcuts to your home screen.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   That's kind of weak sauce.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.440]   I mean, it's not the same as a native app.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.000]   But that felt like, OK, you know, concession.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   However, if you go to this section of the app store right now, find Maps your iPhone.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.760]   Well, I mean, Google Maps doesn't exist right now.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.040]   The official Google Maps app doesn't exist right now.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.440]   But that Guardian article pointed out that no mapping app that uses the Google Maps APIs
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.360]   are listed there, or as of writing that article anyway.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.440]   So that's a little surprising to me.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.960]   It could be that Apple just didn't feel like any of those apps were as great as the other
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.280]   apps that it put in there.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   It could just be a coincidence.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   I don't know.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   Right.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.360]   I mean, I think when YouTube came off of iOS, they also-- it was a similar thing.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.800]   They created a video section of the app store and didn't include Google's YouTube app.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.280]   But then there were some articles written about it, and then suddenly it appeared.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.920]   So this might change.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.240]   Now Apple works.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.400]   It's kind of no explanation.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.680]   Just things change for that.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.480]   Never explain, I think, is there corporate motto?
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.720]   Google went offline for a bit yesterday, for 30 minutes.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   I actually missed this.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   I'm not really sure how.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.560]   I must have been with the baby.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.200]   I guess there was a limited outage.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   It was limited.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.000]   So I might not have been in one of the users for about 27 minutes.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.120]   And the folks at CloudFlare wrote a blog post about what exactly happened.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.440]   Aaron, I don't know how much networking you do at Oracle.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.880]   Is this in your wheelhouse?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   It is a little bit.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.200]   I do cover Cloud, but it's more from a storage perspective.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   I saw this on Google+ as well, but I didn't have time to dig into it.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.960]   Again, I wasn't affected.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.760]   I haven't seen the news specifically who was affected by this.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   Obviously, somebody was affected because it wasn't-- or else it wouldn't become a news
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   story.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.400]   But there was-- I did see something on Google+ this morning about Google going down.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.280]   I mean, it could have been a backbone going down.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.480]   It could have been something that took down a couple sections of server farms.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.480]   I know that--
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.840]   Yeah, it looks like there was a hardware outage at some point along the routing that messed
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.240]   up the routing and was sending packets through Indonesia from California.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.680]   That shouldn't have been.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.440]   And the folks at CloudFlare, I guess, did some sniffing around on the network and got in touch
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.080]   with the routing-- the company responsible doing the routing and helped fix it.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.320]   Yeah, so that's not a big concern.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.280]   I mean, yes, it's an outage.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.680]   These things shouldn't happen.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.360]   But they sometimes do.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.040]   It sounds like human error at some point got involved here.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.560]   So that is always going to be a problem.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.240]   But it sounds like they recognize the problem right away and they fixed it.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.720]   I mean, 27 minutes or whatever it is, 20 minutes worth of time for this problem.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.200]   Actually, that's pretty good to actually be able to analyze the problem, determine a
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.320]   resolution, and then implement the resolution to the problem.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.320]   That's actually pretty quick.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.120]   So it sounds like they had some things in place.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.040]   They were able to flip some switches, correct a routing table or something, and then that
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   fixed it.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   So that's actually pretty good.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   Yeah, it is pretty good.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.280]   Google Voice had a similar problem earlier in the week where you'd send an SMS from Google
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.840]   Voice and it looked like it came from a number that was not your number and it was confusing
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   some folks.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.680]   I'm also a pretty heavy Google Voice user.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.160]   I didn't have this problem.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:19.840]   I think it may have had something to do with some hardware issues having to do with Sandy.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.440]   But that got resolved pretty quickly as well.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.160]   The Roach did a quick piece on it.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.720]   It's really not how often things break.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.440]   It's how quickly they get fixed, right?
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440]   Right.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   Because things will break.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   Yep.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.200]   I'm continually amazed by how much of the internet still to this day runs on personal
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.840]   relationships among engineers and handshakes.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   So true.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.120]   You know, people run into each other at an engineering conference.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   They're just like, "Hey, you're a cool guy.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   I'm a cool guy.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   Let's network."
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   And that's it.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.520]   And billions of dollars rely on this.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.800]   And I really live in fear of the day that the grownups come into the room and want more
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.240]   grown-up relationships because there'll be lots of lawyers involved and nothing will
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.160]   work as well anymore.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   It's so true.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:05.800]   There was a piece in the Times about it was a shopping site, NextTag, that got demoted
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.840]   in Google search results.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.400]   And they were just having a really hard time and couldn't, you know, we're losing tons
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.640]   of traffic and losing tons of money.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.960]   And it turned out that one engineer knew another engineer at Google and was able to
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.040]   like get some clue as to what was going on.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.520]   But it's one of those things where it's like, you know, not everyone has those connections.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.440]   But it really does come down sometimes to just relationships and who knows who.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.600]   And that NextTag piece, I mean, is there anything really new there?
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:36.160]   It just seems like these businesses occasionally pop up that have been enjoying a windfall based
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.440]   on great Google search traffic and then lost it.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   Right.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.600]   And then they feel that they're--
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.680]   And then they feel like they were slighted or that they're at the mercy of Google for,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.760]   you know, for their business.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.440]   There isn't really much new here.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.000]   There's actually a quote in here from Matt Cutts.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.120]   And if he jumps on the show later on, we can ask him about it.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.760]   But yeah, I mean, it's the same story where small businesses are saying, hey, we're totally
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.080]   at the mercy of this giant search engine and this giant search engine is favoring their
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.280]   own products.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.320]   And you know, it's something we talked about on the show a bunch of times.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:18.520]   I mean, I think the lesson here is not that Google is being somehow unfair, but the lesson
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.040]   is rather if your entire business model depends on getting Google search results, you've
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   got a broken business model.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   Right.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:31.440]   Well, but if you're a website, a content site, especially, and you're depending upon advertising,
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.240]   it's page views or getting customer-- not even if you're depending upon advertising,
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.680]   but you're depending on customers to come in and purchase something from your website,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.560]   like your customers have to find you.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   I don't know.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   What else--
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.480]   Well, I know that I oftentimes when I'm doing a search on the website, I'm not going
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.480]   online.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.240]   An Amazon link will pop up, not as an ad, but as a search result.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.680]   Sometimes it's an ad too, and I click on it sometimes.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.520]   But if it's a search result or it comes up in a link from someplace else, you know,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.160]   I mean, having that there and it's key to something specific that I'm interested in
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.960]   actually is a benefit to me.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.920]   And I can imagine that if all of Amazon's stuff suddenly dropped out of the search results,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.760]   that would be a pretty big impact to their business.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.040]   So I think there are companies out there that have a legitimate business model, but also
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.600]   rely-- and you can argue how much does Amazon rely on search results.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.720]   But I think that there are companies out there that do rely on that and that they're
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.200]   big enough and they're all online.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.760]   And so any type of outage like that is a pretty big concern for them.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.800]   And if that's the case, they've got people working on it and they know how to escalate
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.000]   either within Google or whatever to be able to fix the algorithms and hopefully fix whatever
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   the problem is.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.840]   So search results are clearly very important.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:57.480]   But does Amazon get those search results because it gets those search results or does
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.920]   it get those search results because it is successful?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   Right.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.320]   A little bit of a chicken in the egg.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   Right.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.800]   And Amazon's a tough example, right?
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.400]   Because Amazon is so big.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.920]   I mean, people go to Amazon to search for things when they want to shop, you know, because
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.840]   they're just such a well-known name, you know?
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.640]   But when you're a small shopping website, you're a small content website, Mitch and
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.600]   I know about content, well, we all three of us know about content and getting traffic
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.080]   to your content.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.000]   You're a much, much bigger disadvantage.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   True.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I mean, I've been through it.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.280]   I've been through the mill, you know?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   I've seen, I've seen, I've worked on sites that got a lot of Google juice and I've worked
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.120]   on sites that didn't get much and I've worked on sites that did both at different times.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.560]   I've, I've, I've coasted from, not coasted, but I've enjoyed for months and months, a
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.760]   lot of Google traffic and then seen it all kind of dry up and not really know why.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.560]   And the conclusion I came to is you can't rely on Google for your business.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.080]   You've got to connect to your customers a lot of other ways and then Google will hopefully
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   follow.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   Right.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   And if it does, right.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.960]   So, social connections and other ways.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.160]   I mean, to Google's credit, Google does offer a lot of webmaster tools for kind of troubleshooting
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.800]   and figuring out, you know, what's going on with my site?
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.760]   Are there, are there bad and down links?
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   And that kind of thing.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.120]   And this, in this case with NextTag, they, or was it NextTag or it was another, it was
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.280]   another site in this New York Times story.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.720]   It turned out that they had kind of duplicate information on pages.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.040]   So the Google bot, it looked as if the site was kind of spamming or, or planting content
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.360]   that it wasn't actually displaying.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.760]   So it looked malicious and that's why it got demoted.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.880]   So they were able to move that content and adjust it and it showed up again.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.560]   But I think they were only able to figure that out by talking to someone at Google because
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.080]   they had someone who had a relationship with someone at Google.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.880]   What else?
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.380]   What?
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.440]   Speaking of Google, speaking of promoting your content, social, social channels.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   Nice transition.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   He sent me a second.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   That's awesome.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   I need to go a little smoother.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   Leo would have been a little smoother.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   I'm not complaining.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   The odd cause.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   And then the, so forgive me folks.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.440]   It's my first time hosting.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   I thought it was great.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.640]   I thought it was great.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.920]   Speaking of promoting your content through social channels, Mitch, you are pretty active
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   on Google+.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.960]   And you did a post on Google+, recently.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.040]   This was a couple of days ago about how you love the community there, but you're frustrated
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   by the platform.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.800]   How do you think Google is doing with their social play?
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.000]   Well, I have read the same articles that everyone else has read and seen the same studies showing
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.240]   Google+ as a ghost town.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.200]   And then I go on Google+ and I get a lot of activity on all my posts and always see a
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.560]   lot of interesting things going on.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.000]   So there are pretty lively bunch of ghosts over there.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.600]   I consistently get better engagement there than I do on Twitter and on Facebook.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:07.000]   That said, the platform itself just drives me crazy.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.600]   You can't get anything into there automatically, so I can't just set up an automated feed to
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.040]   post in my internet evolution stuff and then not have to do that manually anymore.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.600]   You can't get anything out of there automatically unless you use crazy third party patchwork
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:28.440]   duct tape and safety pin together tools to get your stuff from Google+ to Facebook and
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.040]   Twitter.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.520]   You can't-- it's just a lot of things you can't do that you're used to doing on a mature
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.400]   blogging or social media platform.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.640]   Particularly frustrating to me is that Google has blogger.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   Right.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.360]   So maybe they could do something to sort of join them together while still keeping them
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.080]   separate for people who want the separation and then people like me would be happy and
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.520]   everyone would be happy.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.600]   Moreover, I don't feel like I've seen a major feature upgrade for Google+ in a long, long
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.760]   time and I'm kind of wondering if Google has basically abandoned that sharing portion
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.600]   of it, the part that you see when you go to plus.google.com.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   Right.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:15.040]   I mean, it does feel like especially the API issue of like, you know, the ability to have
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:21.000]   clients that write to Google+ it seems like this is the most obvious thing that Google+
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.080]   needs and I keep waiting for the announcement for that and it just hasn't happened.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.480]   And I actually haven't seen very many updates to Google+ in a while product-wise.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   It's true.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.720]   We saw kind of a flurry of them in the beginning and not so much now.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.880]   And then there's always all these little kind of tiny little move the button from one side
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.480]   of the page to the other updates.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   Right.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.000]   But nothing like you can do this big thing.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.760]   Last time it seemed like the biggest one was the ability to just to do the slider thing
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.760]   on your--
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   On your newsfeed.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.520]   And your newsfeed and in your circles, you know, you could do the slider thing and then
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.440]   decrease the amount of notifications that you get at the same time via email and text message
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440]   and things.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.920]   It seemed like that was the last big one.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.960]   And we talked about this this morning actually on Floss Weekly a little bit because we had
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.560]   some folks in the chat room that were basically saying, does anybody still use Google+?
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.920]   And I'm like, yes, me?
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   Hello?
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   That's where I live.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   Never on Google+.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   That's where you live.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   Is that your primary platform?
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.920]   That's great.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.000]   And it's exactly the reason that Mitch was saying, which is it's interaction.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I can interact with people.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.560]   I can have discussions.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.680]   If something comes up and it's really hot and I want to get feedback, I can start a hangout
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   and get live feedback.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.760]   Last time I did that, I had like 20-- or I wasn't 20.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.360]   It was whatever the maximum was.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.440]   Joined almost immediately.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.680]   Some of them-- I don't know what they were doing, but it was like they just clicked the
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   button.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.080]   And some of them had no idea what I was talking about.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.000]   But a couple of them were people that follow me and they're like, yeah, we want to talk
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.760]   about this thing that you're doing on Android or whatever it was.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.760]   So I cannot get that on Facebook.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   I can't get it on Twitter.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:59.280]   I do push all my stuff out from Google+, it automatically goes to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.840]   And the one trend I am seeing is that people that are typically on Facebook or Twitter
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.360]   are now starting to click through a lot more.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.240]   Like they're not afraid of it, I guess.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.280]   They're not concerned about it or whatever the reason was that they weren't clicking through
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   before.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.120]   Now they'll come across something they're interested in.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.440]   They'll actually click through.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.520]   They may still leave a comment on Facebook instead of Google+, because they don't have
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.680]   an account or whatever.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.760]   But they are at least clicking through to get the information that I'm trying to put out
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   there.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.120]   So that seems like a positive trend.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.960]   But I agree.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.880]   I hope that when Google finally does come up with an API, an open API that people can
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.360]   actually use, I think that what I said this morning was this kind of plateau that they've
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.520]   hit.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.200]   I think you'll see that trend line start to go up pretty quickly at that point because
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.640]   there'll be more ways to interact with Google+.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.560]   And someone brought up in the chat room that Google really hasn't been promoting Google
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.800]  +, itself as much.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:57.240]   They promote Hangouts a lot, but not like plus.google.com as your news feed.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.400]   So Aaron, you write on Google+, and then you push the links to those posts, the permalinks,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.960]   those posts to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   Right, exactly.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.000]   And I basically follow if you've ever seen the easiest way to search for how I do it is
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.760]   to search for Mike Elgens, the way that he does it, because I basically followed what
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.280]   he does for right now.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.840]   The one downside is it doesn't post the pictures to Facebook.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.800]   It doesn't actually put the pictures in line.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.960]   They're the post on Facebook.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.120]   So that's the one downside.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.200]   I'm sure I get a lot more click-through rates on Facebook if I had a picture there.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.880]   But hopefully with the API, that'll change pretty quickly.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.680]   There's a lot of inline links.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   Makes me crazy.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   Yes.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   Sorry, I'm not sure.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:40.160]   There's a service called Deliverit dlvr.it that I like better than the stuff Mike Elgens
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   recommends.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   I will check that out.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   Well, Mike Elgens.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.280]   It has its own built-in tool to convert your Google+ stream into an RSS feed.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.800]   And then it'll send stuff all the way out all over the place.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   It's really very smooth service.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   I like it a lot.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   Yeah, it looks good.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.960]   It looks like both of you have more followers on Google+ than you do even on Twitter.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.360]   I didn't check your Facebook.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.680]   I have way more.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.320]   I have like 10 times more.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.840]   Which is pretty interesting for a newer service.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.440]   I mean, it could be both of your audiences as well.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.800]   My audience is primarily technical.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.160]   And Google+ is primarily a technical crowd.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   Right.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   I mean, that's a thing.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.600]   It's kind of still like the nerd salon, right?
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.000]   Like, my cousins aren't going to see anything I see on Google+.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.720]   But that's why I like posting a Facebook link to Google+.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.240]   But the limitations that, you know, the one photo, the new inline links, makes me, drives
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   me a little crazy.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.720]   And that's a thing about Google+ that makes me think like, well, if I want to write something
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.960]   that I really care about and that I really want to annotate with inline links, that kind
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.520]   of thing, I want to do it on my blog and then post a link to it on Google+.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.520]   Which is fine.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.480]   I mean, I think that's perfectly acceptable.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.280]   For me, it's just always quicker to do it on Google+.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.480]   Because I don't have time to go into the details.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.040]   But I think that methodology is actually the way to go, right?
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.840]   Post it on your blog and then you can push it out to anywhere you want.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.560]   And if people are interested, they'll click through your blog anyway.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.560]   Yep.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   Yep.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.560]   Chad, what do you think?
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.160]   Take a break and do our first sponsor.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   That sounds great.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   All right, cool.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.200]   We got a little bit for Leo talking to us about stamps.com.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.600]   Hey, Twiggers, don't let me interrupt.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.000]   Well, actually let me interrupt.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.160]   Just briefly to talk a little bit about stamps.com.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.840]   I don't have to tell you about stamps.com.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.320]   You know I'm a big fan.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.960]   We use stamps.com here at the office.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.920]   We got two accounts because we wanted two of those USB scales.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.800]   It saves you so much time and money when you're doing a lot of mailing.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.560]   Now it's no point if you just mail a postcard once in a while.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:44.000]   But if you are an Amazon, eBay, Etsy or PayPal seller, if you send out invoices or mailings
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.880]   of any kind stamps.com is fantastic.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   You always have exactly the right postage because you're printing it yourself from your
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.480]   computer and your printer.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.280]   And I'm not just talking about printing out stamps.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.880]   You can do that.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.600]   But you really, I mean you can print out mailing labels.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.360]   You can print right on the envelope with your company's logo, your return address.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.800]   It'll take the address you're sending to from your QuickBooks or your address book or you
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   know the website.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.280]   I mean it is a time saver.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.440]   And if you're doing international mail you'll love stamps.com because it'll fill out all
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.160]   the forms just as you need.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.480]   It's great too if you're doing express or prior email because with a click of a mouse
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.520]   you can send an email to your recipient letting them know your package has been shipped.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   It's very professional.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.760]   In fact it's why the big companies use stamps.com.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.600]   It's why you ought to try it because we've got a great no risk trial offer.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.000]   Visit stamps.com.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.360]   I know you see that $80 offer but don't do that.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   You want to click that radio microphone.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.040]   That'll take you to our special offer page when you use the offer code TWIG TWIG.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.200]   Now look at that $110 bonus offer including the USB scale.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.840]   That's yours to keep even if you decide not to become a stamps.com customer.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.600]   You'll get a four week trial.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.000]   A supply kit that works.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I love stamps.com.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.320]   I know you will too.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.120]   If you do a bunch of mailing stamps.com is a lifesaver.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   Try it today.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.360]   Visit stamps.com.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.080]   Hit the radio microphone.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.600]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   Stamps.com.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.480]   Now back to Jeff, Gina and the gang.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.440]   From afar from pre-recorded land.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.800]   Should we move into the change log?
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   Absolutely.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Here we go.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Let's do it.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:36.680]   The Google change log.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.720]   No buggin' latest outlet this week.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.240]   I got chills there.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.720]   The change log is a section of the show where we do a rundown of any product updates, minor
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:53.080]   updates to Google products across the web just to get them all into one quick segment.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.560]   And we've got a few this week.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.840]   Google releases Chrome 23.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   Last major browser to finally get Do Not Track support.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.560]   Do Not Track is probably the biggest feature in Chrome 23.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:10.560]   That's when the browser sends a special header to websites and says, "Hey, don't use a cross-site
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.000]   cookies and don't track my movements across the site."
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.520]   So a couple of other updates to Chrome 23.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.000]   Makes it easy for you to view and control any website permissions.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.920]   So if you click on a website's page or lock icon next to the address in the Chrome address
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.360]   bar, you can say, "Don't show me images.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.280]   Don't accept cookies," et cetera.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:39.480]   So Chrome 23 should come out through the over-the-air update automatically if you're running Chrome.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   Google Drive got a share to Google+ option.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.880]   So in the share link, there was already share to Facebook and share to Twitter.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.320]   Now you can share your Google Drive documents to Google+ as well.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.240]   Google's search results page also is getting a tweak.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   And I think that this is rolling out to all users in the coming weeks.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.320]   This was an experiment there running.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.920]   Google's tool belt, which normally runs down, they call it tool belt, runs down the left
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.680]   side of the screen is actually going to get in collapsed into a horizontal nav across the
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.980]   screen.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:15.560]   So when you search for a term, you can narrow the results and filter them using the horizontal
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.920]   search bar.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.680]   So it's kind of a cleaner, nicer looking, nice look.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.440]   And it looks like Chad is doing a demo for us right there.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.920]   There's some really cool options there to narrow your results as well.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.880]   You can do it by reading level and by sites with images and whether or not, yeah, go
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.840]   to click on that search tools button and you can see those there.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   And finally, Google Wallet got a little bit of an upgrade.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.880]   And Google Wallet now stores your credit cards inside the app.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.960]   So if you go to a website that accepts Google Wallet requests, you don't have to type in
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.280]   all your credit card information every single time that's stored there in Google Wallet.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.440]   So you can purchase more quickly and easily.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.560]   And I haven't had a chance to quite set this up yet, but it looks like a lot faster and
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.760]   you can see a demo on it looks like 1-800-Flowers.com to check that out.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   And that's all I got.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:12.600]   We love those bumpers.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.400]   That's great.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.880]   I like that section, you know, because we don't get to talk about some of the, there's so
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880]   much to talk about.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   Sometimes we don't get a chance to talk about little stories like that.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   So I like that.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   I love it, actually.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   It's true.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.760]   Every Google products just get updates every week.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.120]   And actually, this was a slow week with the election and Sandy.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.000]   But every week, I feel like there's just a little something here and there.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.880]   So we got changed live together.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.560]   So let's talk about the Google Nexus.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.960]   It looks like next week, the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 4 are going to start shipping.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   We don't have one in studio, but the reviews are looking pretty positive.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.400]   And you're actually running Android 4, 2.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.560]   It's 4, 2, which is the new flavor of Jelly Bean they're calling it, right?
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.000]   On your Galaxy Nexus.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.040]   So what I'm running is just the G apps portion.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:05.480]   So that includes the new Gmail, the new gallery, the new camera, which has a new clock, a new
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   keyboard.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.920]   So it's not the full stack.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   The back end is still 4.1.2 or whatever it is.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.640]   But yeah, I did install the 4.2 apps, which are still, for me, it's a little bit, but
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.280]   I've lost my calendar, for example.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.280]   So that's an issue.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   I might have to go back and work on that.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.440]   And I get a lot of error messages, but it's pretty fun to check out the apps anyway.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.640]   And of course, that's only for advanced developers.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.600]   But it's pretty interesting to see some of the features, especially photosphere, which
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.640]   is like a panorama mode on steroids, basically.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:44.160]   Yeah, it lets you kind of take 360, not just 360, it's kind of like, yeah, it's 360 shots,
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   right?
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.360]   And then you can upload them to Google Maps.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:53.440]   I've got this working, so I can give you kind of an overview of what it looks like.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.680]   You start up my camera here.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.120]   So you can see from the, what I'm ready to take a shot, this is the normal camera view
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   that you get.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.640]   And you can see as I move it around, it refocuses.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.160]   See, there's one of the error messages.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.280]   It refocuses automatically.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.360]   And if I change this to photosphere mode, I'll be diligent about getting rid of those
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   messages.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.800]   Okay, now you can see what it does.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.960]   If I don't do anything, you know, I can move it around and you can see the little grid
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.360]   on the bottom that changes as I move the phone.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.760]   And then to start taking the picture, I just line up that dot with the middle of the phone,
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.560]   it'll take the first picture.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.680]   And then as I move the camera, as I start to move the camera, you'll see another dot
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680]   appear.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.400]   And that means I need to line up with that dot.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.720]   And I can just keep going like this, taking as many photos as I want for a panorama shot.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.200]   Now the other thing that Google said during the thing when this came out is that they
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.640]   based this technology off of the street view technology.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.160]   So the cameras that they use for street view, for example.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.680]   So there you can see all my shots that I've taken.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.160]   I could go on and take more and more and more if I wanted to.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.240]   When I'm done, I just click the done button and I'm ready to take another one.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.880]   Now in the background, well, this is going on, what it does.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   And I'll exit out here.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.280]   You can see in my notifications, it's rendering the panorama.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.760]   So now it's going out and stitching those photos together for me automatically and that'll
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   disappear as soon as it's done.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.880]   And then I can actually open up the gallery and go in the gallery and I'll show you what
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.680]   this looks like.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   I've got a couple of these.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.040]   I did one earlier just in case.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.400]   So I'll open that one up.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.120]   So that's what it looks like after it's all stitched together.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.640]   It really looks nice and pretty and beautiful.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.160]   Jason Howl did one of these from a better one than this inside the brick house.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   It looks really good.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.480]   If I want to from here, I can either edit the photo or I can go to hit the photo sphere
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.960]   button.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.880]   This will bring up a street view like experience.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:56.400]   And so now if I swipe back and forth, I can actually see kind of like an iMacs experience,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   right?
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   Very cool.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.000]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.200]   So iMacs without the nausea.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.600]   Yeah, or with it if I go too fast.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.200]   So that's photo sphere.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.400]   I think that's one of the best features of Android 4.2 that I've seen.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.680]   The gallery is also new.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.480]   As you can see, they've streamlined some things.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.400]   There's my kids and some things from the Exploratorium.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   So they've updated that.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.840]   Also, the other thing they updated was the clock.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.440]   It may not seem like a lot, but it's a pretty major upgrade.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.040]   Let me open that up.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.280]   So you can see it looks quite a bit different than the old clock.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:38.320]   If you're running stock jelly bean or ice cream sandwich, it looks quite a bit different.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.720]   And they've added some things here like a countdown timer as well as a stopwatch.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.000]   You can just click it and start it, which people...
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Oh, Roboto.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's all Roboto techs.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.240]   Really easy to read.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.160]   And so I've been using this for the past few days and it works pretty well.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.680]   So those are the two big things that I've found.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.400]   The Gmail stuff, I really haven't found a use for that.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.640]   And yeah, that stuff, the improvements that are supposed to be there.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.560]   But those two things, I mean, those three things really, the photosphere, the gallery
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.200]   improvements and the clock are pretty cool.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.800]   Also the keyboard is supposed to have the swipe feature, which I can't really demo.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.960]   But it's a little bit more like swipe the application on Android.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.520]   As you move your finger around, it actually can figure out what you're typing.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   So...
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.040]   Can you disable that if you want?
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.600]   I did, I did actually, because it's not working for me.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.760]   It's force closing on me.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.360]   So I actually disable that.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.360]   I use the Swift...
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.360]   What is it?
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360]   The Swift keyboard or...
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.360]   Swift key.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   Swift key, that's it.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   Swift key.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   Are you...
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.960]   Did you get user switching?
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   And the install that you've got?
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.960]   No, I didn't.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.440]   There's new things coming out all the time though.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:52.560]   Like I just saw yesterday they added the new unlock screen that someone was able to port
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   over.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   There's new things coming out.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:00.760]   They didn't add the new lock screen cards or whatever they're calling them.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.160]   That's another feature of 4.2.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.200]   I haven't seen that functionality yet, but I know they're working on it.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   Is it the dream?
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.600]   That's the daydream mode when it's charging?
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   Right, exactly.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   Yep.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.000]   So they're adding that stuff all the time.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.400]   But it's just kind of interesting to run.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.080]   Like I say, right now it's pretty buggy and it's really for developers only or advanced
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   Android users.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   Right.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.480]   You've flashed a new firmware and downloaded a fresh game.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.480]   Exactly.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.960]   I flashed a new packages and things.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.000]   And like I said, I had to really work on it down to the file level, renaming files and
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.200]   everything to try to get it to work.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   So it's not for...
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.440]   Is there any indication when this will come to the Nexus 7?
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.480]   Not that I've heard.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.760]   I haven't heard anything, but because it's a Nexus device you can bet it's going to get
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.040]   it before other tablets, right?
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.920]   So that's the beauty of running a Nexus device is that you get those updates sooner.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.800]   Yeah, I'm hoping the Galaxy Nexus will get the official update.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.000]   Although I have to say I'm tempted.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.960]   There are a few forced closes during your demo there, Aaron.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.520]   So that kind of put me off a little bit.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.640]   But otherwise I'm kind of tempted to flash my phone and try it out.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.440]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.000]   I mean, the problems that I'm seeing, I'm running Verizon's version of the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.960]   So it could be that they're particular ROM that they load on their devices has some things
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.200]   that I've seen better luck from people that are running either an AT&T version or one
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.440]   that they bought off the Google website.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.480]   It seems to work a little bit better for those folks.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.400]   Right, right.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.320]   I think we have Matt cuts on the line.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   Hey there.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.320]   How are you Matt?
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.320]   How are you Matt?
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.320]   Hi Matt.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.320]   Good.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.320]   Good to see everybody.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.480]   Yeah, thanks for joining us.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.160]   Yeah, sorry I'm a little late.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.760]   You know, stupid meetings and work.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.360]   You know, work it in the way it's big, whatever.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   It's not like you got stuff to do over there at Google.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.160]   Well, you know, you know, I love listening to Twig.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.640]   Even while I'm working out, I'll be lifting weights, listening to you and Leo.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.360]   So I'm always glad to be on the show.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.360]   Thanks for having me.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   Yeah, thanks for joining us.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.960]   I listened to Twig when I'm at the park and after I've been on like this for the next
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.920]   couple of weeks, I forget that I'm not on anymore and start responding.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.960]   The other people at the park look at me like, "Huh?"
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:15.280]   So does anybody else do it where you're listening to, you know, a Twig and like you and Leo
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.920]   and Jeff are talking about something and I'm jogging and I'm like, "Somebody bring up
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   section 230D.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   Come on.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   Get your jewelry liability."
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   You know, and then Jeff will do it.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   And I'm like, "Yeah!"
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.640]   And the people walking their dogs are like, "Who is this guy?
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.920]   Why is he talking to himself?"
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.720]   I do it all the time.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   That's what I like.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.040]   That's what I like to hear.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.040]   That's awesome.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.680]   Well, for I'm Twig listeners, know who Matt is.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.040]   He's a head of WebSpam team at Google.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.360]   And actually Matt, you missed it.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.080]   I was going to put you on the spot.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.440]   We talked about that "New York Times" article that you had about Nextag that you actually
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.320]   had a quote in earlier in the show.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.880]   But I'll let you off the hook.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.720]   I mean, it's like we talked about that article really wasn't anything very new.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:06.160]   It's kind of like the same conversation about Google's algorithm and search that we've
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.600]   been having for many episodes.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:13.920]   Well, and I think it's a fair point that Google needs to try to figure out how to scale
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.000]   user support even more.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.240]   It is a really tough problem, but we've come up with different ways to do it, not just
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.400]   Webmaster videos, but we have Webmaster Office Hours.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.040]   So you can show up on Google+, and there's people at Google who are like, "Hey, let's
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.720]   talk about how to make your website better."
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.480]   And so we're always trying to think about how to make things work well, but there will
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.840]   always be someone who can't quite talk to a Googler or doesn't get the information they
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   need.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.240]   So there's always going to be stories that are like, "Well, someone wasn't able to get
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.120]   through to Google, unfortunately."
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   Right, right.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.040]   It seems like that's the key is making it so that's all businesses who feel like they're
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.160]   getting demoted for reasons that they don't understand, is just giving them a way to get
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.440]   in touch, and Google does provide some really great Webmaster tools.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.600]   And you make your videos, and actually I didn't know about the Hangout, so that's really cool.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.440]   I think that's really the key to it.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.440]   Yeah, we just passed 500 Webmaster videos.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:11.360]   If you search for Webmaster Video Channel, and we've got 9 million views, which 9 million
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.240]   people wanting to talk about SEO and search, I would never have predicted that in a million
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.240]   years.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.880]   But hey, if people are curious, how we're on, you know?
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.840]   I think it was the piano playing cats that you put in those videos that really pushed
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.120]   it up the top.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.920]   So I did make a video where I pretended to be a dinosaur, and people liked that one enough
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.760]   where I'm going to remake that one later.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   So you can...
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   Nice.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:41.200]   So we were just talking about the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 4 shipping next week, and Aaron
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:47.320]   has installed the new jelly bean on his device, so he was just demoing a photosphere for
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.520]   us.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:53.160]   We don't have a 10 or a 4 on hand to actually try ourselves, but the reviews are looking
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   pretty good.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.640]   It's funny, it seems like the Nexus 10 is getting a lot of the attention, but the Nexus
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.280]   4 looks like a really neat phone.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.040]   I want that wireless charging thing.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.280]   That's really, really cool.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.680]   So for months at Google, whenever somebody releases a Nexus device, I'm like, "I really
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.920]   want the wireless charging where I can just put it on my car and it'll just...
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.600]   I don't have to deal with any wires."
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   And then at some point, someone was like, "Matt, shut up, we're actually doing that for the
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   Nexus phone."
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   And I was like, "Oh, okay, never mind.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.600]   Okay, I'll shut up."
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.800]   But yeah, it's like, "Why would you ever want to deal with even a micro USB or a Thunderbolt
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   thing?
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   Just put your phone down."
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   And by the way, you can't do this, but I would love if you could get audio out as well.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   Cool.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   That would be fantastic.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.560]   You just put your phone somewhere in your car and it doesn't slip around and you could
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.160]   pipe the audio into your car stereo.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   I would love that.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   But maybe future generations, we'll see.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.840]   So I was going to ask these guys, I'll recuse you, Matt, from this.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.640]   So the holiday season's coming up and a relative really wants a high-powered tablet.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.680]   Are you going to go Nexus 10, iPad or the Surface?
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.560]   Ooh, silence.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   Uh-oh.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.480]   Uh-oh.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.840]   Can I go Nexus 7 or is that not an option?
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.440]   I think Nexus 7's an option.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.880]   Yeah, that's what I was listening to.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.040]   Nexus 7 on that.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.880]   Nexus 7 for me too, especially with the new, the higher storage capacity as well as the
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.360]   3G support.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.400]   I mean, that was kind of in the announcements that was kind of skipped over by a lot of
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   people.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:33.240]   But to me, that's a really big deal, especially with Nexus 7 becoming more popular.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.760]   People are more interested in it.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.040]   And I think that adding those capabilities, I think, is a big win.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.960]   And I think it only costs like 50 bucks more for that version, which is outstanding.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:49.640]   So unless you really need the bigger tablet, I would say Nexus 7, for me, my opinion, is
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.320]   the way to go.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.960]   Over the iPad mini as well.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   Yep, oh, definitely.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.960]   Yep.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.880]   Mitch, where are you about iPad versus Android on tablets?
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:08.320]   I'd say that iOS and Android, in general, iOS and Android are pretty equivalent, both
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.920]   on tablets and the iPhone.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.720]   It's really come down to a matter of personal preference and some niche interests, whether
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.360]   a person would want to buy one versus the other.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.720]   For me personally, I love my Nexus 7.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.360]   I was joined at the hip to the iPad for two years.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:29.600]   And then the day I got my Nexus 7 was the last day I used my iPad.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   It's got stuff.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.680]   Looking at it right now, it's got stuff piled on top of it on my desk.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.080]   It's a serving tray.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   Pretty much.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.320]   Oh, Mitch, your lunch is ready.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   Here you go.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   Yeah, really.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.840]   David Letterman did when they came out with the original iPad.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.920]   It was like, "makes a great salsa cutter."
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:55.600]   I had to say, the 7-inch format is really, really nice.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.840]   My mom is actually thinking about a tablet for Christmas.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:03.000]   And she uses an iPhone right now because we trickled that down from when I still had
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.160]   an iPhone.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.320]   And so it is a challenge.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.920]   iPad Mini versus Nexus 7.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.240]   The Nexus 10, I mean, the resolution is pretty phenomenal.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.360]   So it sort of depends on whether you're a power user or whether you just want something
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.960]   you can hold in your hand and carry around with you.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.360]   And if you just want something simple, Nexus 7 is really nice for that form factor size.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:27.600]   That was the most surprising thing for me about the Nexus 10 was the resolution.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.240]   And it was like, "Whoa!"
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.240]   I mean, the specs on it, if you check them out, I mean, they're in comparison to even
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.240]   the retina display.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.000]   I have to be careful because sometimes I call it the rectal display.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.800]   And it's totally just a subconscious thing.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.160]   It's a brain fart, is what I call it.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.400]   It's nothing bad about the display.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.360]   Now we're going to be able to visualize that the rest of the day.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   It's just that it's slipped out by a mistake a couple of times.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.800]   And I'm like, "No, no, it's not a bad product.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.680]   It's a good display."
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.400]   Anyway, but it's very similar to the retina display in terms of quality.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   I mean, I was really impressed.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.560]   That was the most thing that I was impressed about the Nexus 10 was the quality of the
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   display.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.760]   Really amazing.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.480]   I had a conversation with a friend on Facebook.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.400]   It was about phones rather than tablets.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.000]   But I think the answer applies.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.280]   He had what was a high-end Android phone and wanted to know whether to switch to iPhone.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.000]   And we went back and forth on that for a while.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.520]   I finally said, "Look, if you're happy with Android, go with the car in high-end Android,
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.360]   get in Nexus 4," or whatever the high-end was back then.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.280]   If you're really in the mood for a new gadget and want to change and fool around with some
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.080]   stuff, get an iPhone 5.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.360]   And I think that's a good answer for anybody.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.760]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   I agree.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.760]   I'm really excited that the Nexus line is now kind of filled out.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:49.000]   I'm kind of saying I had the Nexus 1, I had the G1, I had the Nexus 1.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.840]   I've been kind of talked to them on the show about how I love having sort of like the
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:57.280]   official or the unofficial official Google phone and how you get updates on them faster,
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.000]   you don't get kind of the crap where you get from the carriers.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.440]   And I'm excited now that the Nexus line has the three sizes.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.800]   I feel like it took a long time.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:11.280]   I was sort of, we've been waiting for the Nexus answer to the iPad, the larger size iPad.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.680]   Although now with the Nexus 7 and the iPad mini, the attention has really kind of shifted
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:19.560]   to that smaller form factor, which is really kind of great as we all -- I love my Nexus
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560]   7 as well.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.320]   It's very seldom that Steve Jobs was just plain wrong.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:32.880]   You know, not a matter of opinion, not I disagree with his philosophy, but wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:37.240]   And this idea that something this size is something that human beings can't use because
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.680]   we're incapable of going like that.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   I mean, what?
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.680]   What was he thinking?
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.000]   He also warned Barack Obama that Obama was going to be one-turn president.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.440]   So this has not been a good week for Steve Jobs' past years for predictions.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   That's right.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.920]   Well, you know, data won the election.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.520]   It was like Nate Silver and the Obama campaign's data crunching.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.720]   Never underestimate the power of data.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:12.200]   As far as the Nexus 4 is concerned, I mean, I do have some reservations there, not from
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.800]   a general user perspective, because I think that -- I think people will love it if they
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   get that phone.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.400]   That's going to be a problem for anyone.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:25.000]   But, you know, the non-removable battery, no microSD slot.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.040]   I mean, for me, those are things that are important.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:33.400]   I definitely missed the microSD slot on my Galaxy Nexus that I have now.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.720]   But at least there, I have 32 gigs with the Verizon versions, right?
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   And I'm already at like 18 gig.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.040]   So when I think about going to a new Nexus device that only has 16 gig, and hopefully
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.520]   that'll be improved somewhere down the line, I have to think, okay, I'm going to have to
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.560]   cut back on my apps and the data that I have on my phone to go to that device.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.640]   And there's no option to do anything else, really.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.640]   I don't -- go ahead.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:58.160]   I was going to say, this is the whole thing with the removable battery in the SD card.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.000]   That's very Apple-like.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.120]   You get the trade off of size and weight.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.680]   If you got a removable battery, your device is bigger and heavier.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.680]   Right.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:09.680]   And did you guys -- go ahead.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.760]   On my iPhone, the first thing I get is that mophie juice pack thing that you can just slide
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.480]   the iPhone right in, and it's an extra battery.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   Now it is a trade off.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   It's like $100 more.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.480]   But --
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.280]   And huge amount of bulk, right?
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.040]   That you're adding to the phone.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.040]   And weight.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   So usually I just keep it in my bag until I need it.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.040]   Right.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.040]   That's not Steve J.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.520]   J. J. J. J. J. J. being wrong or previous phones being wrong.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.520]   That's just a trade off.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.080]   Do you want the removable battery and are you willing to pay for the extra weight all the
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.680]   time and the extra bulk to have it?
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.280]   I don't know if you guys talked about this last time, but did you guys talk about the
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.160]   Verge video, the video that the Verge did with Matthias?
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.160]   No, we didn't.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:51.800]   Duarte, it was interesting because he said people don't want to have to fiddle around
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.960]   with SD cards.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.600]   People don't want to have to fiddle around with batteries.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:01.560]   But at the same time, you know, the battery specs on the Nexus 4 don't seem that great.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.680]   So if you're going to put out a product that has a limited amount of battery life, it would
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.600]   be really nice to at least allow people to buy an extra battery and put it in there.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.480]   Because that's what I do with even my Galaxy Nexus now is I have two batteries.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.560]   I keep one fully charged up, you know, and then the other one when it runs out, if it
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.400]   runs out in the middle of the day and I'm working, I just change out the battery.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   It's no big deal.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.640]   I think average users can handle that.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.600]   How often do you do that?
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.360]   Your phone runs out in the middle of the day?
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.680]   Well, it depends on what I'm doing, right?
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.640]   So if I'm playing a game and the screens on all the time, then yeah, absolutely it does.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:38.440]   Or if I take a trip and I'm playing music in the car and also the car is searching for
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.920]   Starbucks Wi-Fi's all over the place as I'm driving down the highway, then yeah, the
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.200]   battery does run out in the middle of the day and I'll have to either find some place
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.440]   to charge it or hopefully I've got that extra battery.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.080]   Like when I'm charging, when I'm traveling on a plane, it happens all the time.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.000]   I'll wake up in the morning, I'll go to meetings, then I go to the airport, I get on the plane
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.320]   and by the time I'm on the plane, the battery dies and I'm like, "I got to sit here for
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.320]   two hours with nothing to do," right?
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.600]   Nope, I've got my extra battery, pull it out, pop it in, I'm good to go.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.400]   So anyway, that's kind of a deal breaker for me at least at this point.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.560]   We'll see when the device comes out and more people start talking about it, maybe I'll
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.560]   be swayed.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.760]   Yeah, and it totally in a different device, but I found with the iPhone 4, the battery
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.480]   would last a full day of heavy use right up until about dinner time and then I would
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.240]   have to sort of nurse it to get it to bedtime and that was why I had the mophie.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.360]   That's just one person's experience, one device.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:36.720]   One thing I've noticed though is it seems like Google often will do the features first and
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.120]   then once the features are in good shape, then it'll optimize the battery life.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   And so it might be the case that 4.2 is so fresh out of the oven that I wouldn't be surprised
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:52.280]   if they put some effort into saying because someone had said the Optimus G had slightly
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.280]   better battery life and to me that sort of indicates and this is just my personal take,
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.800]   I have no insight knowledge that maybe Google is getting Android with the new features and
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.160]   then they'll think about optimizing to improve the battery life and make it last a little
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.160]   bit longer.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:10.680]   It is tricky because I like to, I've got a Galaxy Nexus where I added an extra battery
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:15.120]   that doubled the size and so I like to do mine large.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.160]   But one thing that might work out well for the Nexus 4 is if you have those inductive
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:23.440]   charging pads, if it's in the car you just put it down on that and then it's charging
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:28.040]   at while you're driving to work or at work you could just put it down right beside you
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.360]   on the desk and then it could be also charging that way.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.200]   So that might work out pretty well.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.160]   Yeah and the chat room is also pointing out that since I have a Verizon version it's the
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:42.120]   LTE radio is actually draining the battery as well as the Wi-Fi issue.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.120]   So that's a good point.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.320]   Well done chat room.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:49.920]   That could be a difference if you're running the GSM version, your battery life may, you
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   may get a little bit more out of your battery life.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.160]   Matt, what's the name of that extra battery finger you've got in the back of your Galaxy
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Nexus?
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.400]   That is a good one.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.760]   Yeah I get it from CDO.com.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:07.080]   It's S-E-I-D-I-O.com and it's pretty nice.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:14.160]   I think the size of the battery ends up being 3800, really amp hours or whatever and they
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.480]   even have a model that has NFC built in.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.760]   And so if you want to use your Google Wallet or whatever and still have a battery that's
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.440]   twice as big it totally works.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.080]   A lot of people care about having a really sleek slim phone.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.840]   I would rather have a phone that's like half a pound that gives me battery life for eight
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.400]   days or something like that.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.640]   So I'm in a weird design space.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.280]   I never want to run out of my battery on my phone so I don't mind it being a little bit
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.320]   bigger and I just slip it in my front pocket there.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.760]   You should get one of those really big, big as your head 1980s phones like in Wall Street
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:51.920]   just like fill it with battery and minor electronics and it will be a conversation piece.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.760]   You could probably get one and just slip it in there and have a huge battery and then
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.720]   you could have a little micro USB where you could like power your display from your phone
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.720]   or something like that.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.960]   That would be awesome to have.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.080]   I want one of those.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   My battery lasts for three weeks.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.840]   I think you could like go up to people and say look at this.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   It's a phone.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.400]   You know I can make a call while I'm walking around.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   It's not attached by a wire to the wall.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   This is so amazing.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:23.760]   I have to carry around 20 pounds of batteries but hey it's okay.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.920]   I'm willing to sacrifice.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:34.360]   Speaking of phones let's take a quick break and hear from Leo telling us about our next
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.280]   sponsor, Ting.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.040]   This week in Google, Ting brought to you by Ting.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.040]   I like that.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.240]   TWIG brought to you by T-I-N-G.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240]   What is Ting?
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.920]   Well Ting is no BS mobile service.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   Simply put.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.260]   I mean come on really.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.960]   Most mobile carriers are just a pain in the butt.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   They got you locked in.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.920]   They got two-year deals, early termination fees.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.400]   Not Ting.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400]   There's no contracts.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.920]   No early termination fees at Ting.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.320]   It's completely contract free.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.520]   They don't bundle or add ride along services so you know what you're getting.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.080]   Here's the beauty part.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.680]   You could specify how many minutes, how much data, how many text messages you expect to
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:19.480]   spend in a month but if you use less they refund the difference.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.760]   If you use more you don't pay a penalty.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.120]   You just pay at the normal rate so there's no overage charges, no penalties.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.320]   You get credits on unused service.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.840]   There are no add-on charges either.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.360]   Listen to what you get with every Ting phone.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.160]   Voice mail, caller ID, tethering.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   That's right.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160]   They don't block it.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   Hot spot.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.160]   Not either.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.240]   Three-way calling, call forwarding, everything part of their basic set.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.180]   No add-on charges, no mysterious items on your bill.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.480]   You just pay for what you use.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.280]   No more, no less.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.320]   Every phone on the Ting network is $6 per phone.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.200]   This is great for a family plan or a business.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.880]   $6 per phone plus then the very affordable service it's shared among all the phones.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   It couldn't be more simple.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.080]   They've got a great online account tool to do.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   You know exactly what you've spent and what you're planning to spend.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.160]   Great no hold customer support too at 855 Ting FDW.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.240]   Ting FTW is their Twitter account too I think.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.640]   Anytime between 8 and 8 Eastern, real person will pick up the phone and I've got to tell
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.840]   you they've got the best support.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.360]   They also have great help forums and documentation at help.ting.com.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.200]   Really, this is the No BS phone service.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.240]   Put your money where your phone is.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:40.800]   Show the world that you care that you want good phone service and Ting will do it.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.680]   Go to Ting.com right now.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.000]   Actually, we've got a special page for you.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.840]   twig.ting.com.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.880]   You'll save money and their savings calculator show you just how much and if you mention
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.640]   twig you'll also save $50 on your first Ting device when you sign up.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:02.160]   Actually, that offer codes apply automatically if you go to twig.ting.com.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   I love Ting.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   I know you will too.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.040]   I support these guys because they're really changing the idea of what mobile phone service
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.480]   really is all about.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.920]   twig.ting.com.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.920]   Now back to you, Jeff and Gina.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   Let's see.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   Let's keep talking about Android.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:28.760]   75% of the market share in Q3 followed by 14.9 for iOS and 4.3 for BlackBerry.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.920]   Those are really big numbers.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.240]   Only 2.7% of devices around jelly beans.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.720]   So that's not such a great number.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.080]   So we got a mixed bag here.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.760]   On one hand, it's like, oh, you know, this is Android's taking over.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.400]   On the other, there's that pesky fragmentation problem.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.840]   I guess it's good that people upgrade their phones every two years.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:57.040]   At some point, people will upgrade their phones.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.960]   This is kind of another reason why I'm excited about sort of the Nexus line getting filled
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.520]   out and maybe getting more popular is that these updates will come out faster.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.600]   I know that Google's been working on getting updates out faster.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.680]   For what it's worth, I just looked at the stats from my app, which is to do text, which
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.920]   has only got about 10,000 users.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.320]   It's kind of a weekend project for me.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.160]   So it's not a huge sample, but a lot of nerds use it.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.680]   And I've actually got 30% using Android 4.1, which is much higher than 2.7.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:30.200]   So it really depends on what perspective you're looking at it from.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   Very cool.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.960]   You have a geek follower audience, then.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   I do.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   I do.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.640]   Yeah, everyone gets the new Nexus when it comes out or has an old Nexus.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.960]   So they get the new stuff.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.440]   I think everybody's update crazy a little bit.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.640]   I mean, I know I am, but I'm kind of an advanced user.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.600]   So I picked up my sons, whatever he has, an Optimus V or V or whatever.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   I think it is.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   I can't remember.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.560]   But I picked it up last night to do something for him.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.480]   And the interface was fine.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.760]   I didn't miss anything.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.680]   Of course, it's not an advanced phone.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.440]   I mean, it's kind of a medium phone, not for advanced users, probably, or someone that's
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.400]   looking for a four-inch display.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.920]   But I think it's running 2.3.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.480]   And that's pretty old right now, but it's still functioned great.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.480]   There was no problem.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:22.120]   He certainly doesn't complain to me, oh, occasionally he'll say this app won't run or
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.560]   that app won't run on my phone.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.000]   A lot of this just because of the specs of the phone itself.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.520]   But he doesn't really complain about the interface and missing the features that I have on my
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.600]   Galaxy Nexus that much.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:38.880]   So I just wonder how much of it is us pundits saying, we want our updates and how much of
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.640]   it is the general public who's at works.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   Fine.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   Right.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.720]   My wife uses a seven-year-old smartphone.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.400]   It's like this.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.600]   It's like ancient.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.320]   She's finally upgrading to my old iPhone 4, I think, as much to get me to shut up about
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.320]   it.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.840]   We're already actual desire to use it.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.720]   But yes, she has lived a full life without having the latest dot release of anything.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.280]   It is a good point.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.440]   Is it more of a PR problem than an actual regular user problem, right?
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.160]   I mean, as technologists, you read about the new release and you want the new release
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.440]   on your device, and it's frustrating when you don't get it.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:25.600]   I think Apple has really touted that iOS device owners get the new stuff basically right
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.320]   away.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   This fragmentation thing.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.200]   I mean, it's also frustrating for developers as well, especially when you have new features
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.120]   that you can only take advantage of on some phones and how many different versions do
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.800]   you have to support.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.240]   But it's a good point that maybe this really isn't a regular user problem.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.760]   Maybe this is just a tech bubble problem for this fragmentation, tech bubble and developer
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.760]   problem.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:51.160]   I mean, Gina, I know your family is a lot of civilians as is mine.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.080]   I mean, when you go back home, how many of them are running ancient phones and perfectly
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.080]   happy with it?
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.880]   Yeah, many, many of them.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.960]   It's funny because they'll say what phone should I get?
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.320]   I'm up for an upgrade.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   What phone should I get?
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.920]   My, for me, the answer for me is like, well, we'll get the new Nexus.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.360]   But then I kind of stop and I'm like, well, the reasons why I'd want the new Nexus because
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.360]   I want the new Android and I want the fastest thing, they're not their reasons.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.400]   They want something that's reasonably priced and that's going to do what they needed for
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.480]   it to do, check email, browse the web, maybe install a few apps.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:26.640]   And they're not going to be in a blind rage about the random NASCAR app or whatever that
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.600]   they cannot install that I'll be in.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.560]   It's two totally different targets.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560]   And it's true.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:37.000]   Yeah, most of my family who are using a couple generations back or don't have the latest
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.240]   updates and they're absolutely fine with it.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.560]   So what do you tell them when they say that?
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.160]   When they want their phone device?
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.960]   Like from the very, very frustrating response, which is it depends.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.840]   And then I asked them questions about like, well, how do you feel about just a touch screen?
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.640]   Do you want a full, you know, do you want a keyboard?
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.800]   Like my mom, she wants actual keys to press.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.480]   You know, you know, do you have you ever used a Mac?
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.280]   Do you know, I think about Mac, you know, to kind of get, get a feel of how they, how
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.320]   they would do in the Mac environment.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.560]   You know, do you use, do they use Gmail?
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560]   Do they use maps?
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.480]   You know, I kind of ask them what they're looking for and what they want to use.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.200]   And basically I tell them to get the mid level to look at their plan, look at their contract
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:20.240]   and go to the Verizon store, the AT&T store, whatever and kind of get the midway handset.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.240]   Good answer.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.400]   By the way, I saw what it was like to live on the other side of that chasm when we first
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.760]   moved here.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.880]   I noticed my neighbors across the street are these fantastic car buffs.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.560]   They're always out there restoring these old cars and they've got, I don't even know
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560]   what they have there.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.320]   There's just these classic 50 year old cars.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.840]   I said, oh, go over and ask them for a mechanic recommendation.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   Fantastic.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.840]   They'll know the best guy they go to.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.160]   So we go across the street, we ask them, they say, well, if you want body work done,
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.240]   there's this one place like two hours away.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.440]   And there's this other guy who does breaks, who's the best and he's like an hour away.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.120]   And they're coming up with six different people to repair the car.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.880]   And I'm like, I just want one guy, ten minutes away, I can drive the car and I come out,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.840]   it doesn't make funny noises anymore.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.640]   So I'm a civilian.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.960]   Yeah, that's what people deal with when they ask us about phones.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.080]   What do I have to say?
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.680]   It's funny to think about the upgrading because I think Chrome is a good model for this.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.960]   I dare you to tell me what version of Chrome any of you are running right now because you
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.960]   don't care, right?
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.920]   You just get an update every six weeks and if you're on beta or dev or stable or whatever,
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.200]   it's just like, oh, maybe I read a blog post and I realize I have a few new features, you
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.040]   know, WebRTC or whatever.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.040]   Great.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:40.560]   And in the steady state with the low friction of the Web, it's just automatic and maybe you
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.520]   close Chrome and you update it and you start it back up again.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.600]   But I have stopped noticing what version of Chrome I'm using.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.880]   And to me, it's kind of like Android is kind of stuck in this world where there's still
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.680]   friction on getting those upgrades and in an ideal world, if there were no friction, you
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.680]   might not even notice.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.160]   You just notice your computer getting better, you know?
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.800]   It's the model for how to do updates.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.360]   I think I read someplace somewhere where the Chrome update mechanism was the first thing
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.520]   that the engineers built before anything else.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.160]   It would just be this program that would auto update silently.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.960]   I actually, I think Chrome is the reason why we don't care about browser version numbers
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.240]   anymore and I think that's a good thing.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.600]   I don't think regular people should care about version numbers ever again.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   Yeah, I wonder.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.000]   I mean, that was the thing with Firefox, right?
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.600]   I mean, every time my Firefox updated, I would get a little new window that would come up
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.480]   telling me, oh, now you're running Firefox.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.320]   It was automatic, which is great, but it would also come up and say, now you're running
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   Firefox, this version.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.800]   And I was like, oh, okay, how is it different?
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.800]   I don't know.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   I don't care.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.800]   So I never see that on Chrome.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   It's a good point, Matt.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   Well, and it's--
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   Go ahead, James.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   Go ahead, James.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.800]   Go ahead, James.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:53.840]   And it was a wonderful thing because Mozilla does great work and it was an open source and
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.240]   people get really excited about Firefox and a number.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.280]   But I think the Chrome way really just makes a lot more sense.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.520]   I mean, users shouldn't have to care.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.680]   And it's funny to go to a bookstore and you're like, you look at--
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.560]   I was at the beach recently and somebody had a sticker on their car that's like, I do
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.720]   Photoshop.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.640]   And they say, I do Photoshop Creative Suite 2.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.080]   And now they're up to Creative Suite 5 or 6 or something like that.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   And it's just like, don't put your version number of the software on a book anymore.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.040]   You know, just say, I will teach you Chrome or I will teach you Office or I will teach
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.320]   you Windows, but well, Windows you might have to have a version because they're so big
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.520]   as far as updates.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520]   But I mean--
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520]   Oh snap.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520]   Just--
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.960]   Well, for good reasons, for good reasons, right?
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.000]   You want to have stability and the companies really care about that.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.160]   But you know, it's just hilarious to walk into a library and they have like a book sale
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.640]   and they're trying to sell you, you know, Office 92, you know, instructional guides or
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.640]   something like that.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.280]   That just doesn't seem like the way it'll be in the future.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.240]   That's a good plug for online documentation and online books, right?
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.040]   I mean, because then you can just update it and you have all your archives, you know,
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   they're truly archives.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.800]   If people do want to go back and get that stuff, but you know, I like that model.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.800]   It's too bad Jeff isn't here to talk about it, but I'm sure he would.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.080]   I like that model of open books.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.400]   You know, here's a book, a manual, I updated it.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.240]   You get the latest version automatically if you've bought the book and if you want to
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.960]   go back and read, you know, older versions, you can do that.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.240]   And there's no like paper going back and forth and that whole library thing you talked about
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.680]   doesn't happen.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.640]   Maybe maybe someday I know we're getting close to that.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.920]   Maybe someday we'll be there for sure.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.800]   So I'm hanging onto my Windows 98 for dummy's book.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.160]   I'm going to be able to use that one day.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.960]   It'll be a classic.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:49.080]   Yeah, like the 50 year old cars people will be like, whoa, what install is that, man?
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.240]   We actually we had one, so around Google, we like to test with lots of different devices
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.760]   and somebody wanted to see what something looked like on an original iPad.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.160]   And so somebody had a loaner and they're like, whatever you do, don't accept software
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.160]   updates.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.320]   This is the only original iPad we have and it's the only version of this OS.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.760]   And so don't update the software, please.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.520]   You know, that's the only way we can test to see how stuff works.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520]   So don't click it.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.520]   Don't tap OK.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.520]   Just don't tap OK.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:20.160]   Exactly.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.080]   So speaking of Microsoft, I can tell that all of you guys can be really excited about getting
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.800]   office on Android.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.800]   No?
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   Yeah?
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.640]   Microsoft Office for iPhone, iPad and Android are coming out early 2013.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.560]   Isn't it like read only or something or maybe just read only and light editing?
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.000]   Ah, looking at the Verge story here.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.200]   And it looks like, yeah, Office Mobile debut in the form of free apps that allow Android
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.200]   and iOS users to view Microsoft Office documents on the move.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.320]   So yes, it does appear to be read only in it.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.760]   And it looks like it's coming to iOS first.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.680]   We'll see if Apple approves it before it gets uploaded to the Play Store.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.440]   I mean, Office is the corporate standard.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.640]   So it's going to be, you know, if they can get a full version or nearly full version
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.120]   on tablets, that'll be great.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.120]   I think Leo brought this up a couple of episodes ago and they were just sort of crickets.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.680]   That's why I was talking about it.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.120]   That's all I'm being excited about it.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   Sorry, Microsoft.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.200]   Microsoft, it's up, up time today.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.960]   I mean, you know, at least they're doing it, right?
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.480]   I mean, they could just they could just they could say no.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.480]   If you want to run office and you want to have 100% office compatibility, you've got
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.000]   to run Windows and that's it.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.800]   You know, so I give them kudos for at least doing it, right?
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.280]   Because I can use I can use Google Docs for most things, most work, most even if they're
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.680]   done in office formats, I can pretty much open them and read them in Google Docs.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.400]   But there are a few little features that you can't get to work, right?
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.240]   So so we'll see.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240]   I mean, I I give them.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.640]   I'm not a big Microsoft fan, but I give them kudos for at least embracing the platform
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.200]   and and trying to get it out there on a platform, as we said earlier, that now has 75% market
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   share.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   Right.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   Absolutely.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.640]   And it was it's interesting to see how, you know, they had Internet Explorer for Macintosh
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.160]   and they sort of decided not to do that, right?
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   They sort of backed off.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.640]   And so you've got Windows and you've got office and it's interesting to see different
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.880]   parts of Microsoft now responding differently to these sorts of platforms.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.800]   So you know, it's it's something you might not have seen a few years ago.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.680]   So, you know, it is neat to see Microsoft sort of asking themselves, what do we need
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.560]   to do to be most responsive and help people on a lot of different platforms and they'll
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.480]   make a search application that's available on Android and they'll make a being application
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.560]   that's available on iOS.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.440]   And I think that's a good thing because then people have a lot of different choices and
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.280]   they can decide what works well for them on any platform.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   Absolutely.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:54.480]   I think you guys, you know, I should have included this in the in the change log.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.680]   But have you guys seen Google now and how's a pedometer built into it now?
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.320]   I haven't actually seen this card.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   This is interesting.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.720]   Because I use the Fitbit.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.240]   So I like to keep track of how far I've walked.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.480]   It looks like this card only shows up in Google now every every month.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:15.280]   Last night, because the month of October came to close Google now, this is from DroidLife.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.160]   Started showing a new card to a number of our readers.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.360]   The new card is a pedometer that's been tracking their steps in Miles bike, oh, Miles bike
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.560]   as well over the last couple of months behind the scenes.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.920]   I say behind the scenes because this is a card that we have yet to see or hear about.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.880]   I took a little quickly through Google now settings could not find this feature mentioned.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.720]   I haven't seen this either.
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   Have you seen this Aaron?
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720]   No, I haven't seen it.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   I was just trying to pull up my cards and I don't have it in there.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.160]   I did read that article though.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.400]   I thought it was pretty interesting.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   I mean, why not?
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.840]   I mean, that's I think we're going to see a lot of these new uses, right?
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.160]   For cards coming out over the next over the next year.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.360]   So I mean, that would be something that's really interesting to know.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.560]   Everyone carries well not everyone.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.400]   Most people carry their phone around.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.480]   My wife leaves her behind all the time, but most people carry their phone in their pocket.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.720]   Was there working going from place to place?
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.320]   Why not have a pedometer function built in?
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.200]   And a lot of people are really interested in that.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.800]   I mean, like you said, the Fitbit is very popular.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.400]   And I think you can get a similar functionality with Google.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.880]   I forget they call it Google tracks or my tracks.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.840]   There's that app on Android that yeah, I think it's my tracks.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.840]   But it doesn't do it automatically.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.600]   I mean, you got to start the app and say, OK, I'm walking now.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.920]   And all that kind of stuff.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.480]   So I think something that does it automatically is really interesting.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:32.720]   And anything that helps people be more health conscious, I think is great.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]   Yep.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.440]   Jeff, Mitch, you're a walker.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.440]   What do you use?
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.520]   And you got a Fitbit, but then you returned it, right?
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520]   Do we lose Mitch?
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.520]   We may have.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.520]   Oh, yeah, briefly, even second.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.520]   Sorry.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.520]   Oh, no, that's OK, Jeff.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520]   Nope.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.600]   So Gina, are you a Fitbit user?
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.720]   Because if so, we need to be Fitbit buddies.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.880]   I'm a huge Fitbit guy.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.600]   I am, except I just had a kid a couple of weeks ago.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.320]   My Fitbit steps took this awful dive.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.600]   So I'm in this terrible, shameful place with it.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.880]   But yeah, we have to be friends because it really motivates me to get the email
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:12.360]   at the end of the week about which one of my friends have recently kicked my butt in
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.720]   terms of steps.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.920]   It's kind of funny.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.680]   I've gotten about three different people at Google hooked on it.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.160]   My secret plan-- don't tell anybody.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.440]   I don't know why I'm saying this on Twig-- is to try to get enough people hooked that
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.640]   we can get everybody at Google on to Fitbit.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.880]   They actually have a perk where they will give you a pedometer for free because it's
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.160]   like a really great way to just get into shape a little bit more.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.520]   But there's such a trend toward everything going into your cell phone, right?
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.520]   And you've got a pedometer.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.520]   You've got your keys.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   You've got your wallet.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520]   You've got a pen and paper.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.240]   All of that has sort of-- or could eventually migrate into your wallet or into your phone,
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   rather.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.640]   And the sooner the better, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.000]   Yeah, it makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   It's just one less device.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.600]   I mean, that's the other thing with the Fitbit now, especially with the baby, is I get up
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.040]   and down during the night and remembering to turn it on and hit start and stop.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.680]   I mean, of course, I'm not going to have my phone-- I don't necessarily grab my phone
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.560]   until I've gotten up and had my tea in the morning.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.160]   But still, it's a good enough.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.240]   And this is the thing about the Fitbit I had to accept is that it wasn't perfectly accurate
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.720]   all the time, but as long as it's consistent, I was fine with that.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.440]   And I feel like with the phone, doing that in the background passively without me having
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.560]   a clip thing to me or wear a bracelet all the time, that's a good thing.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.240]   Yeah, I had problems with the Fitbit.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.320]   I ended up sending it back.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.560]   It wasn't accurate enough for me at all.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.240]   Yeah, you're a serious walker.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.320]   You're an accurate kind of like-- you did actual tests with the Fitbit a mid-track.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:39.960]   Yeah, I was like-- I went on Google Maps to find the nearest football field to me.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.760]   And then I drove over there, and then I got out of the car, and I paced it out to see
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.240]   how the Fitbit was doing.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   Wow.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:51.280]   Really, really way, way getting way in deep into OCD territory.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.360]   I finally just shipped it back because it was just so far off.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.720]   I think the breaking point was when I left it on my desk for a day, and it measured 500
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.720]   steps.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.040]   That was supposed to start.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.360]   I read your blog post about this.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.080]   And when you said that, that disturbed me.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.400]   I was like, oh, wait a second.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.200]   There's a bad accelerometer or something.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.160]   It could have been just a bum unit.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.400]   Everyone's in a while thinking about trying another one just to see if it will have a
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   better look.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.840]   And there's so many different--
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.840]   I got it.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.840]   I got it.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.840]   I want the fuel band.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.840]   There was the jawbone there for a while.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.040]   But I have stuck with the Fitbit.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.160]   But I'm interested to see what Google now does with that data.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   So Matt was saying something about Wallet.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.520]   Did you say something about Wallet, man?
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520]   Well, yeah.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.040]   Just the fact that Wallet seems to be going into your phone.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   Wallets are pretty handy.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.360]   And Google Wallet's pretty handy.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   Why do you ask?
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.120]   Well, I was just wondering because there is some news this week about Google Wallet or
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.480]   at least some rumors going on, right?
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.480]   Yes.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.480]   Uh-huh.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.480]   Go ahead, Jeetie.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   You take it.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   Fair to comment, Mr. Matt Cutts.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.360]   I enjoy reading the external coverage.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:04.040]   And I know nothing about any of these things.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.960]   But it's definitely the sort of thing where once I read about it, I'm like, wow, that
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.960]   sounds cool.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.880]   I wonder if that's going to happen.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.360]   But can we ask you to show us the contents of your wallet?
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.680]   Do you have anything interesting in there that we can-- I want to talk about?
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.760]   Um, that might not be a good idea right now.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.400]   Even my Google Wallet might not be the good idea.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.680]   But in general, the philosophy is Google Wallet should make things as easy as possible
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.960]   to check out online, on your phone, wherever you are.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:42.160]   And why on earth do you want an extra pair of stuff in your back pocket when you could
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.560]   use something that's more secure and tied with a password or with your phone or with
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.760]   a pen or something like that?
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.360]   So a lot of people, I think, sort of saw the first version of Google Wallet and concluded,
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.240]   oh, this is what Google Wallet is.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:59.520]   But I think Google definitely thinks hard about how to make all kinds of payment easier
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.400]   and they're going to keep working on that.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.920]   I think the argument for mobile payments for the consumer really is not there yet.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:11.600]   Because carrying a wallet and paying with credit card or cash really isn't tough.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.160]   It's kind of annoying.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.440]   I mean, all right, let's be first world problems.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.600]   I'm sorry everybody is suffering from Sandy right now.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.600]   I'm going to complain about paying cards.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.400]   But it's kind of a pain.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.600]   I mean, no, you get your hands dirty with the cash, you got to count it out, you got
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.760]   to give the credit card, you get the dirty pen that everybody else in the restaurant
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.000]   has had, the waitress has to go back and forth.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.280]   Isn't it so much easier to just wave your phone?
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.760]   I don't see it that way.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   I see it like figuring out how to use the wallet and especially in the early, well,
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.600]   especially in the early times when this is going to be adopted, people aren't going
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600]   to know how to use it.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.800]   It's going to be available in some stores and not others.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.320]   But you'll always be able to use that cash or credit card.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.680]   I think the way it's going to get adopted is the merchants will start picking it up first
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.400]   because they'll have advantages in being able to tie it in for customer tracking and
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.400]   for loyalty programs better.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.320]   And then at that point, they'll offer discounts and incentives for consumers to use it.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.960]   Yeah, it really is about ubiquity, right?
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.720]   And so I think that's one of the reasons if you didn't pick it up before we were alluding
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.480]   to the rumors about Google coming out with a physical card for Google Wallet.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.480]   Thank you Aaron.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.480]   Sorry.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   I just wanted to make, before we got too far, I wanted to make sure that we knew what
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   we were talking about.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.800]   But I think that's why this is happening, right?
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.840]   Because it is difficult to get, there's a lot of competition in this space.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:36.440]   It's pretty difficult to get new readers into stores once they've made, especially big
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.960]   stores, like supermarkets.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:41.600]   Can you imagine going in and saying, "Oh, I know you've gone with this provider, but
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.960]   why not go with this provider?"
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:48.160]   And you can get a few users that come in every day and use their phone.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.560]   So I think that it's a difficult sell and I think that this kind of bridge the gaps,
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:58.680]   so I've got my plural and singular almost up there, between where we're at today and
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.200]   where we could be a couple years from now.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.920]   Yeah, and it's fun to think about how good it could be 10 years from now.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.520]   You think about something like Square and one thing they do pretty well is they try
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.760]   to re-arragine what would purchasing look like.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.520]   You wouldn't have to have a card or anything.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.320]   You could just walk in and say, "Hey, I'm Bob.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.000]   I already ordered this latte."
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.160]   And then you pick it up off the counter and you walk out.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.480]   If you're an introvert, you don't have to deal with anybody.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:27.560]   One thing that I thought was also interesting is they announced a mobile version of Google
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:34.080]   Wallet because the stat that they give was that 97% of mobile shoppers often abandon their
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.080]   shopping carts.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.920]   And if you've tried to buy something tapping in on the keys of the phone, you know that
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.720]   it's really, really frustrating.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.880]   And so if people want to buy something on their phone, I was walking in to work this
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.000]   morning and I was buying some chocolate bars on my phone using the Amazon app.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   But it ought to be that simple to buy wherever you want, wherever you are with whatever device
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.640]   you have or don't have.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.480]   Just sort of make it a lot easier for you.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.280]   Matt, I think you've outlined the path to acceptance.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.840]   I mean, one thing you see consistently with emerging technologies, it's never, at first
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:10.720]   it's always crappy at doing what the mainstream technology is good at, but it can do something
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.480]   else that the mainstream technology can't.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.160]   And then after everybody's got it to do the new thing, then it gets better at doing the
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   mainstream thing.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.760]   So you start out with the kind of mobile payments that you describe that you really can't do
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.920]   now with a credit card in cash.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.480]   And then after everybody's gotten used to that and really wanting that, the last thing
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.480]   that's going to happen is the local pizza place.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.520]   So we'll get it so you can buy your pizza with a metal charge card when you walk in.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:44.400]   And the notion that your waiter can take your card and just swipe it and steal money
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.840]   from you or do identity theft, you know, there have to be better ways to protect security
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.040]   and your financial data.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:58.020]   It just seems like I would rather trust a company that does a really good job of securing
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:03.040]   data rather than trusting 40 mom and pops, many of whom might leave their credit cards
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.680]   unencrypted somewhere without realizing it or expose their database up on the web.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.440]   So there's some of those side benefits as well.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.720]   Yeah, I will say that that was one of the good things that at least I've noticed from
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.640]   a Google Wallet perspective because I got my phone replaced that had a bad USB port.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.240]   So I had to have it replaced.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.680]   And when I got the new one and I went into the Google Wallet website, it said, Oh, you
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.880]   haven't logged into Google Wallet with this old device for quite a while.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.400]   And there was an option just to disable it.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.440]   And so I just click disable and it said the next time somebody tries to log in with Google
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.520]   Wallet, everything will be shut down and it won't work anymore.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.760]   And so, you know, it's a pretty good feature to have that, you know, so that, you know,
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.600]   because otherwise, you know, similar, like you got to call a credit card company and,
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.600]   you know, I mean, you got to have those features.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.120]   And it was just nice to see that that feature was there, I guess, in the Google Wallet software.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.000]   So, yeah, so I mean, so we have the mobile upgrade, which you talked about in change
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.920]   a lot earlier, where you store a different credit cards and your Google Wallet account
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.720]   so you can pay in the mobile site.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:08.720]   We've got this rumor that Matt can't confirm about a plastic Google Wallet card, which would
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   work just like a credit card, but would map back to your all your other credit cards.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.560]   So imagine you have three credit cards, you add them to this rumor to Google Wallet card,
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.440]   and so now you can use any one of them.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.440]   That would be convenient.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.560]   And then there's that, the other piece, which launched a while back, and in fact, my co-host
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:30.480]   on the other show I do, Kevin Purdy, you know, he walked into a Burger King in Buffalo, New
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:36.120]   York with his Nexus and he, you know, wanted to pay by tapping NFC, you know, pay with
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.520]   Google Wallet at the cashier.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.440]   And it didn't go so well, you know.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   He tapped in.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.040]   He didn't work, and then, you know, he said to the guy, "Hey, I'm trying to pay this way,"
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.920]   and the teenager behind the counter was like, "Oh, was that supposed to work?"
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.840]   You know, there's a lot of it.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.080]   You know, so it's, you know, this is a kind of slow, rough transition, but I like, it looks
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.760]   as if Google Wallet is trying to come at it from lots, you know, from a few different
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.440]   approaches and get folks just kind of used to it, you know, just get kind of used to
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.160]   the idea of like, "Oh, this is, you know, this is an easy way to pay, and oh, there's
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.920]   that logo that I know, and I can use it here."
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.120]   I really think that paying with cash or credit card is a pain in the butt, and I look forward
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.160]   to being able to pay this way electronically.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.360]   You know, I went into the Apple Store and like scanned an item with my phone and paid through
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.680]   my Apple ID, you know, right there on the spot.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.200]   It knew I was in an Apple Store because my phone's location, and I just walked out of
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.000]   the store without having to talk to anyone, and it felt like, "Oh, this is clearly how
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   this should work."
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   I don't think so.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.280]   You managed shoplifting for a situation like that.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.480]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.760]   I mean, I think theoretically the person that's standing at the door could have asked to see
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.800]   my phone for the receipt, but they didn't.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]   So yeah, I don't know.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.800]   I don't know either.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.240]   NFC in itself is a very interesting technology.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.640]   I was in San Francisco, and I promised to make this short because I know we're running
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:03.920]   short on time, but I was in San Francisco, and parking meters now have NFC chips built
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.920]   in.
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.840]   And I guess either the parking meter I was using didn't work with Google Wallet.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840]   I don't know what it was.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.440]   It wasn't picking anything up.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:16.280]   I must have looked very, very silly standing next to the parking meter, holding my phone
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.760]   like different positions around the parking meter.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.160]   Nothing's happening.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.600]   I'm sure people were like snickering and laughing at me, but I was like, "You know what?
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.520]   That would work so much better because I was trying to use an app, and I had to punch in
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.640]   all those numbers to tell it which meter I was next to, which is handy.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.440]   But wouldn't it be nicer if I could just hold up my phone and be like, "Yep, I want to
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.440]   park there.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.440]   Thank you very much."
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.800]   So I think this is going to broaden out.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.440]   I think this is going to get bigger and bigger over the coming years.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:46.000]   You could have told people with performance art.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.520]   It seems like what you often see is this stuff seems weird or silly or non-functional
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.840]   right up until the point where suddenly it takes off all of a sudden.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:02.120]   For a long time, mobile at Google was half of one software engineer's time because back
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:06.040]   then it was WAP or WML wireless markup language.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:10.760]   And it was such a crappy experience that nobody used it, and so the usage was zero, and so
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.720]   it really wasn't worth even a single engineer's time.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.240]   And then all of a sudden you see some of these trends coming together where it's like, "Oh,
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.720]   let's go ahead and invest and get ready for what's going to happen."
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.920]   And I think one of the things that I've discovered at Google is if you want to know whether a
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.160]   team is going to succeed, two things to look at are, number one, how fast they can iterate
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.800]   because they can experiment and try things and adapt.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:36.480]   And number two, how often they keep rolling things out and looking for new ways to introduce
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.840]   new functionality.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:41.520]   And one thing that gives me a lot of heart is you've seen so much stuff happening with
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.600]   Google Wallet recently that you can tell there's a dedicated engineer, a group of engineers
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.480]   trying to think, "Okay, how are we going to make payments better, whether it's on the
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:52.920]   web or mobile or in the browser or whatever?"
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.880]   Cool.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.760]   So I think we should take our final break.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.640]   Whenever we get back from the break, we'll do our tips, tools, and tips, I guess, numbers,
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.960]   whatever you guys want to share the week when we get back.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.600]   But Leo's got a message for us from Squarespace.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:14.600]   Well, we're glad that everybody's okay back east and Jeff and Gina and everybody.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:18.760]   I guess Gina's in the west coast, but Jeff and everybody's okay.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.920]   You know, Squarespace, whether it's a storm quite well, did you hear the story of how
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:26.280]   Anthony Castellina ran over to their network operations center at Pier 1?
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.560]   We helped ferry fuel upstairs so they could keep the generators going.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.960]   They were slept on cots overnight.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.200]   These guys, it's kind of impressive.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:38.160]   When other sites were going down, Squarespace was up and running.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.320]   That's what I love about Squarespace.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.320]   They really care.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.600]   They're the best hosting service out there.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.880]   They also give you great content management software.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.720]   It kind of goes hand in hand.

[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:28.880]   This week in Google, back to the show.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.000]   Our tips and tools, I just want to make sure that any other stories that we didn't cover,
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.680]   that you guys want to address before we go.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.320]   Matt, did you have anything from the Googleplex?
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:46.160]   I'm curious whether you guys did any quarterbacking of the elections and the coverage or any
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:53.400]   of the tools or there was that good story on time that talked about how the Obama campaign
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.000]   actually did a lot of data crunching.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.920]   The sorts of things like if I want to reach women in this age and this demographic, instead
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:07.160]   of just buying local news ads or 60 minutes, they would find the demographics that matched
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.280]   the most with very cheap sort of arbitragey kind of ad time.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.200]   And so they could get the biggest bang for their buck in terms of money.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.760]   And it's amazing to see how much of an impact big data can have on everything, but not just
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.640]   startups, not just technology, even politics and campaigns and elections.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.800]   That was a really good story.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.120]   I absolutely loved that I loved that this was such a data-driven campaign and they said
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:35.240]   that basically no decision was made on hunches or because it was what had been done before.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.640]   Everything was based in numbers and had hard data behind it and that the campaign had really
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.000]   gotten their databases together since 2008.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.680]   This is a very googly way to approach it.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.240]   I mean, everything being sort of very data-driven.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.920]   That was a good piece and we'll add that to the show notes.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   Cool.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:57.160]   Aaron Mitch, you got any stories or should we move straight into our--
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.400]   Yeah, I got one that's cool.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.480]   Kind of hilarious actually.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:06.200]   It's the fifth anniversary of Android this week, fifth anniversary.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.480]   There's a story from Engadget in 2007 talking about how Symbian, Nokia and Microsoft say
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:15.320]   that Android basically won't go anywhere.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.880]   Oh, Android is five years old today.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:20.880]   This week.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:21.880]   That's amazing.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:22.880]   Wow.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.880]   And time flies.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.520]   Nokia says we don't see this as a threat, which basically is why Nokia isn't doing that
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.520]   great.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.840]   Microsoft said it really sounds like they're getting a whole bunch of people together
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.880]   to build a phone and that's something we've been doing for five years and we've already
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.160]   got five guys using it.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.080]   So they didn't say that last part.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.960]   So I'm looking at this.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.560]   I'm still only about 99% convinced it's not a hoax because this is too much of a perfect
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.560]   story.
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.280]   Well, you should read Apple's comments at the bottom.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.120]   I love that part.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.960]   Apple says we have a great relationship with Google and this doesn't change anything.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.560]   They are certainly an important--
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:09.760]   They're certainly an important partner for the iPhone.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.760]   That's pretty funny.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:13.760]   Time machine.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:14.760]   Yep.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:15.760]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:22.400]   It reexamined your assumptions every five years or so just to make sure you are asking
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.400]   the right questions.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.760]   I mean, it just goes to show with any new technology you never know, right?
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.760]   It's true.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:34.480]   I mean, I think there was not just the competitors, but I think a lot of pundits and things weren't
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.480]   sure either.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:39.920]   I wasn't sure I was rooting for it, but I wasn't sure it was going to succeed.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.600]   And boy, it certainly has though, so that's great.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.240]   Well, when Chrome launched, a lot of people said, "Well, what do we need with another open
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240]   source browser?
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.240]   We've already got one."
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.120]   But it's been a pretty good voice for trying to make sure that the web is open and that's
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.120]   kind of nice.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.680]   But not to say we haven't had our products that have shut off and have not succeeded.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.680]   We certainly have.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.680]   That's--
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.280]   Chrome really was one of those blockbuster things.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.360]   And I remember in Chrome launch, I think, but we have Firefox.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.360]   Why do we need this?
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.120]   And that, yeah, Google did prove us wrong.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.920]   But yeah, there have been some bodies on the long-around way.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.920]   So the spaghetti didn't stick to the wall.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:22.920]   There was a story that maps was an afterthought in the iPhone.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.080]   And it was like a day or two before the announcement.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.320]   We were like, "Should we put maps in?"
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.320]   "Yeah, sure, why not?"
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320]   "What the heck?"
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.120]   And now it's become an essential feature of smartphones.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.120]   Yep.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.760]   And a contentious app as well.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.640]   And that was even before navigation, right?
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.240]   I mean, that was before you could do navigation on the phone.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.240]   Right.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.240]   Right.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.680]   Aaron, what's your last pick for our story today?
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.680]   You got anything?
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.680]   Or are we good?
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:46.680]   No, I think we're good.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.720]   I mean, there's a bunch of legal stuff that we could have talked about.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:55.280]   I'm not sure that we have time to go into all that or need to go into all that.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.440]   And we already mentioned the Twitter thing with the election, which was really great
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.520]   that they didn't crash.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.480]   So congratulations to Twitter.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.640]   Rest in peace, Valle.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:07.640]   Right.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:08.640]   Let's hope so.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:09.640]   All right.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.640]   Let's go into our tips of the week.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:16.160]   Matt, why don't you kick us off?
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.160]   Absolutely.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.360]   So I have a search of the week.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.000]   Last night I was watching the election and it was really funny to see how everybody before
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.520]   the election, a lot of people were dissing Nate Silver.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.120]   And then right afterwards they're like, "Oh, he actually nailed every single state."
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:36.440]   And so I did a tweet that said, "Hey, Nate Silverfax, just like Chuck Norrisfax."
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.320]   And it kind of caught on.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:44.520]   So if you do a search on Twitter for hashtag Nate Silverfax, be prepared to lose an hour
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.520]   or so.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:50.640]   Things like, "Nate Silver can recite pie backwards."
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.920]   Nate Silver does not breathe there.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.560]   He just periodically samples the atmosphere.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.800]   One of my favorites, Nate Silver is permanently banned from buying lottery tickets.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.800]   Nice.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:05.560]   I had no idea that you started this, Matt.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.360]   This is very funny.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   He did turn out to be the geek hero of the election, didn't he?
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.920]   He really did, yeah.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.920]   I really liked the Obama style poster with math on the bottom.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.080]   And it was also Nate Silver's picture in an Obama style, you know.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.640]   But on the bottom it says math.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:29.160]   It happens that of hope, it's nice.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.560]   Mitch, what's your tip this week?
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.600]   Well, it's tool actually.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.440]   We were talking earlier about Microsoft Office.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:42.600]   It is the corporate standard for, and if you're a professional writer like I am.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.040]   One of the features you want to see with Microsoft Word is version tracking and comments.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.920]   You can see what changes have been made.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.000]   These have not been available to my knowledge on mobile platforms.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.120]   They've been really, really hard to find.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:02.320]   But, and I found a really nice app called Text Maker Mobile for Android costs eight bucks.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.640]   And you can see when people have made changes to documents and see comments and documents.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.280]   Most of the people listening to this are probably saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, who cares?"
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.120]   But a few people are going, "Wait, that's really great.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.080]   What's that again?"
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:21.960]   Nice, nice.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:22.960]   Let's Text Maker.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:27.000]   Text Maker Mobile, yeah, it's eight bucks.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.240]   Eight bucks, but worth it.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.880]   Aaron, how about you?
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.640]   Was the photo share?
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.400]   Was your Android demo your tool for the week?
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.080]   Yeah, that was the tool for the week.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.760]   You know, I could come up with another one though.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.560]   If you put me on the spot, which is Call App, we'll see if chat, how quickly chat can get
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.560]   that up in the place to our Call App, which is an application that overlays your contacts.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.680]   It's like a kind of a replacement for your contacts.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:57.200]   And what it does is it goes out and it searches social media to pull in things like LinkedIn
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.360]   information or Facebook information.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.360]   I remember a couple of versions ago in Android, there was the Facebook thing that you could
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.160]   link to your Facebook contacts.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.800]   And this is kind of like that on Stairoid.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.760]   So when someone calls, you'll get a picture of them, you'll actually see what they've
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.320]   been doing lately, who they work for.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.720]   Even if they're not in your contacts, it'll go out and try to search very quickly to get
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.720]   some information.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.400]   So by the time you pick up the phone, you kind of know who it is and who they work for
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.960]   maybe or what your relationship is to them, if any.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.320]   So it's pretty cool.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.960]   It's called Call App.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.560]   And I know that there's other apps out there on the market like this, but I happen to see
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.560]   this one this week.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.120]   And it seems like a pretty cool app.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.720]   They've got a lot of features.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.520]   They've got, you know, there's a lot of things you can do with it beyond just contacts.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.120]   So you can actually, you know, quickly go to someone's Twitter feed right away from the
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.240]   app instead of having to go out of the app to go to, you know, open up Twitter and go
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.240]   to Twitter.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.400]   You can actually just go to their Twitter feed right from the app or whatever you want.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.680]   So of course, you do have to put in your information, your login information for the
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.080]   various sites, whatever you want to connect with, whether it's Facebook or LinkedIn or
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   Twitter or whatever.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.160]   But it's a pretty cool app.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:10.120]   I posted about it earlier on Google+ earlier this week and a few people tried it out.
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.480]   One person reported that there might be a problem with the photos, the photosensor or
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:16.560]   proximity sensor on some phones.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:20.120]   So that sounds like there's still maybe a few little bugs and quirks, but it's a pretty
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120]   interesting app.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.640]   So I'd encourage people to go check it out if they want to get more information about
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.480]   people that they're interacting with on their phone.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.480]   Very cool.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.480]   Very cool.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.320]   Yeah, it looks like a really good app.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:37.320]   So I tip this week is courtesy of Google operating system.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.880]   It's a Gmail trick, actually.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.360]   There's an experimental labs feature, which is new to me.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:46.440]   It launched late last year, but it's new to me called smart labels that automatically
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:53.920]   labels email coming in for bulk mail, notifications, promotions, forum updates.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.440]   And Google operating system was saying that they've got this new smart label called social
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:58.440]   updates.
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.280]   So they're like, you know, the email that comes in there like notifications from LinkedIn
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.800]   or Facebook or other social sites.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.760]   It will automatically label if you enable this experiment, the labs feature, which you
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.920]   can do in Gmail settings.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:14.280]   They'll automatically label these kind of social updates as such social updates.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.600]   And then if you click on that label in your Gmail inbox, you can say automatically archive
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   these.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:23.440]   So if you're secure email inbox getting just filled up with social updates, you know,
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.640]   friend will question LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever, you want to have them.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.400]   You just don't want to see them in your inbox.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:33.400]   You can enable this smart, this labs feature, which is smart labels.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:37.200]   And then you can say, send all these that get this label to the archive.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:38.320]   Don't show them to me in the inbox.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.600]   And I'll reduce a lot of the noise in your inbox.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.920]   So thanks for Google operating system for that one.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.880]   Yeah, very cool.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.320]   And I think that's it.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.400]   Thank you so much to all of you for being on the show today.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.400]   Matt Cots is our friend, head of the web spam team at Google.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.320]   Thanks for being with us, Matt.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.720]   And Mitch Wagner, editor in chief of internet evolution.com.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.040]   Thanks, Mitch.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.200]   And Aaron Newcomb, sitting in studio, working at Oracle.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.520]   I'm the warm body.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.520]   Doing the source.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:14.160]   You're like the sky safety nut.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:18.120]   Like if all went wrong, at least we'd have Aaron and we still have the studio.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:19.120]   That's right.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:20.120]   That's right.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.120]   Now it was great to be here.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.600]   And what a great panel you guys were great today.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:27.840]   So I feel privileged and honored to be on the same panel as you folks.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.840]   I'm not Leo Leport.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.360]   I'm Gina for Panny.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.160]   As you can tell, it's my first time hosting.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.800]   Thank you everyone for bearing with me while I did that.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.840]   And thanks to our awesome panel for getting together today.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.840]   It's a really good show.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.840]   It's great.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:40.840]   Thank you for having me.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.780]   Tons of fun.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:43.780]   And great job, Gina.
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.080]   You did perfectly well.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:46.080]   Yes.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.520]   I think it's a little more practice, but I appreciate you saying that.
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:50.520]   Thank you.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:51.520]   I would have never known this.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.520]   That was your first time.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:54.520]   I think really smoothly.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:55.520]   Thank you.
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:55.520]   Absolutely.
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:05.520]   [MUSIC]
