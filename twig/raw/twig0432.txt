[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.820]   Which is right next door to sugar land, Texas Stacy

[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.500]   Just go there go there and you have family coming and you showed us before the show that you have a Gantt chart
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140]   To organize
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140]   Thanksgiving
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.820]   Yes to organize the workflow Wow
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.740]   Jeff Jarvis is also here. What are you doing for tomorrow's feast? Oh as little as possible good man
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.380]   Do you watch football?
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.740]   You know I my son poor him is a Jets fan and so I started dear
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.740]   Yeah, it's hard and Jake is
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.900]   So I start but now I'm wondering whether I should feel guilty for watching at all. I know you know
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.060]   I feel guilty because you're talking about the the brain trauma that the football now we're learning that this is really
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.340]   Devastating to everybody the sad story Aaron Hernandez the patriot who?
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.500]   went to jail for murder and then committed suicide in jail
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.260]   He was I think 27 or 28 the doctor who recently did the autopsy on his brain said it was the worst case of
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.460]   What they call it BC T CTE he'd ever seen and in somebody so young
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.460]   He said he had the brain of an old man
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.180]   And so then you start to put that in context that this guy you know he wasn't a murderer
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.020]   He was he was his brain had been injured by years of football
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.580]   Very sad. Yeah, so you're right football. I do I love it. I
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.660]   Mean what are you gonna do?
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.720]   But but Lisa who's really the real fan of the family same has the same qualms about it's like should we
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.900]   Maybe we should give us should give it up. I don't know
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.140]   Do you trust Alexa Cobra wants to know a Stacy for your timings? Oh
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.500]   Yes, actually your first Thanksgiving with the echo
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.740]   No, I've had the echo since 2014 Wow
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.940]   You're you're a pioneer. I bought it. I bought it the day it came out. I was like this is awesome
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.980]   Isn't that funny how you I just did the same thing? I mean we've got it immediately and then still there people go
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.140]   Well, but I don't understand why you would want that what what?
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.140]   Trust us I am using my June oven and I have a lighting recipe for my family like for the dinner
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.020]   So it's a little late, but we did this Saturday. We're gonna do a cooking news screen savers
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.180]   Including the June oven the mellow
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.220]   Suvide cooker. Oh, which I love by the way another super pricey internet connected gadget for cooking and
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.540]   We we roast the potatoes and the June oven came out perfectly. We I can show you the video of the oven
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.300]   Hasden Q what's that?
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.900]   It is a it is a cooking
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.660]   appliance that is a pan it looks like a pan and you stick things on it and
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.780]   Or it looks like a stovetop. Oh, it's a smart cooking system
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.660]   Yes, so the Heston Q is it's smart fry pan and then a burner plate. I was like an inducted inductance plate
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.340]   Or do you have the thermo mix?
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.100]   And you got gadgets galore and what's funny is these are all IOT gadgets. They all have blue juice and
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.860]   That's crazy. What's the thermo mix? Oh?
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.680]   Now this came out in Europe years ago and basically it does everything for you people who it's a
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.900]   $1,500 device people have it love it. What it's so weird. It's
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:47.540]   What is it? It looks like a blender, but it's heating it shops your food it it cooks your food it
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.260]   It's magic. It's your food for you. It does not eat your food, but yeah, it's it's kind of crazy
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.500]   I don't know how to it's like something you would see on on late at night on the qb c channel
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.660]   But you get this I didn't get it. She said fourteen hundred bucks. Oh you didn't get I've seen it
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.220]   thermo mix keeps track of your cooking time and gives you precise and constant temperature
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.060]   Well the access will stop by it now time you need
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.340]   You just have to wait until you hear the sound that will remind me you need a college degree to operate this thing
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.620]   So
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.000]   Cooking cooking cooking cooking used to call it
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.900]   The real mixing I
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.780]   Know people use their Vitamix blender to make soup because it does heat up and your soup will get hot from the Vitamix
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.540]   But this looks like sign of something Wow, so you don't have this. I'm glad to see I don't have that now
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:53.260]   I'm only so fancy. I did you know I we I got a I got I don't want to go into it. I've it's ridiculous
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.940]   What'd you get now?
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.700]   The problem with being a geek and then having other hobbies like photography or cooking is it just ends up being
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.260]   really expensive and it doesn't make you a better cook or a better photographer
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.320]   But it's what the in photographers call it gas gear
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.940]   acquisition syndrome and I got it. I've got such bad gas
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.940]   Okay
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.960]   Thanksgiving is tomorrow. That's why we're talking about all this but today a little Thanksgiving from Peter Teal who sold
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:38.340]   73% remember he was he's featured in the social network movie is the first guy to invest in Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.220]   Candaman said I got this thing it's at Harvard right now
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.560]   He gave him half a million dollars a small investment that made him a very very wealthy man
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:53.140]   $3 yeah a billion he sold 160,000 shares for 29 million
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.220]   He still has 11 million dollars worth of shares left as of this morning
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.500]   So Facebook's up a lot 58% this year
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.100]   So which makes Mark Zuckerberg 25 billion richer. He's now worth $75 billion
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.220]   Teal is a mere 3 billion air 3.2 billion dollars
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.660]   But but it will you know it teals also off the board at
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.740]   Y Combinator right or he was an advisor Y Combinator
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.300]   He's off the board there and
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.340]   Is he off the board face? Well, I don't it doesn't say these off the board
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.500]   I just try to look it up. No, but I would have to imagine at some point
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.300]   That's a pretty big. I mean still has some God help us. He's getting ready to run for senator something
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.340]   Or you know, maybe he's you know, right
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.980]   Maybe he's just that's fine to take a break and enjoy life, right? I don't know this is a guy
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.100]   I don't think this is a guy who enjoys life. Yeah, I was meant to say I don't really
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.260]   envision doing no
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.060]   No, I always wonder see this is why I'll never be a billionaire because you know you give me five bucks ago
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.060]   Okay, I'll see you tomorrow
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.820]   Okay, I'm off time for my end. She read oh, yeah and she read a time
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.980]   I'll never that's a problem. I give up eat too easily
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:19.540]   I don't think that's really a problem only only in America in our ethos is that a problem? I know yeah
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.620]   Hey, have neither of you bought the pixel buds. Yeah, right? Oh
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.980]   Oh, I canceled him. Oh, I canceled him. I have to turn I have to I have to return mine
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:36.940]   Mind stopped working. Why'd you send yours back as Stacy? Um because they were the most uncomfortable horrible ever
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.380]   God, it felt like spiders clawing at my ears
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.780]   You know the sound quality was good although Sam
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:49.700]   Mascowich had a pretty good piece in ours Technica and which he said it he has a broader musical taste
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.780]   I guess that I do but he listens to older music doesn't sound as good. It's tuned for modern pop music
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.300]   I didn't know but there's a lot of sound shaping going on in the pixel buds
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.180]   But I thought they sounded very good the music I was listening to I kind of like the idea of it being in your ear
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.100]   But then it just basically they stopped working and I can't repair them. I can't pair them to anything it is
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.180]   So now I have to call them and get a June un-pair them or well
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:19.500]   Yeah, it wasn't pair them first it wasn't working so I forgot them on my pixel phone and then I never could
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.660]   Repair them so the whole thing is I mean it's any and they've had such trouble with the pixel phone
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.820]   I mean I think it's okay now they've they put out an update that let me
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.860]   Saturate the color more and there's no burn in online, but still what's going on Google?
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.820]   Can we talk about that momentarily because I have my own issue
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.440]   Which is you have a the smaller you have a little one I have the smaller I have the little pixel the pixel the pixel mini
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.060]   The we pixel so I called them because you know
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.260]   I was kind of sick of having my NFC radio turned off
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.620]   So I was like hey can you know my phone is clicking?
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.100]   Can we is there something you guys could do and they're like well?
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.620]   We have an update that addresses that but it's not yet. Okay, so he tells me it's out
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.700]   We've started pushing it and I was like great
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.780]   Could you like push it down to me super fast? You know now could you now?
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.100]   Yes, cuz I didn't have it and he's like well
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.380]   It'll be out to you in a few weeks and I was like I am not on a carrier
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.100]   They are not Apple having to stagger their release times
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.220]   You know like it's not like he's got 50 million of these out in the wild you're on Google Fi
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:34.380]   Um no, I'm on Verizon, but it's an unlocked phone. So my carrier doesn't push anything right so
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:43.420]   What this tells me is Google can't do an update an over the update what this tells me is Google can't do hardware
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.420]   It's very disappointing. I mean here they are
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:53.940]   They're really kind of making a push to compete with Apple and in some respects. They do the cameras great right Stacy. You love your camera cameras
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.620]   Yeah, it's great
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.180]   But in other respects
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.440]   They just I mean this is not as good a screen and as either the Samsung notes or
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:10.340]   S8s or the Apple iPhone 10. It's just not a very good screen and then it's got buzzing and clicking on the pixel 2 with it's got
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.900]   burden issue on the XL and
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.900]   the pixel buds
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.740]   Why did you return yours Jeff just you didn't return him you just cancel him. I just cancel him just today
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.340]   I remember the show coming up. Oh better cancel him for us too late
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.740]   I just read the reviews too often the pairing is what killed her for me
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:32.060]   Yeah, I want to be able to operate among the three devices seamlessly and you got an unpair and repair
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:37.900]   You know put them back in the case do so old for you get it plus plus the translation is dopey
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.820]   It works much better just using it as always on the phone because yeah
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.900]   The purse so the real problem is the translation that's being made is you don't you hear it
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.780]   But the person who may who talked to you and the other language doesn't hear it
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.100]   So can't correct it and since it does make mistakes
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.060]   It's really better to do it on the phone where both sides can hear the translation and say no no
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:03.420]   That's a mistake. I what I meant to say was you need to be able to do is like the it's a gimmicky thing
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.260]   Because they said okay, we can put a system on the on the on the buds. Oh, what can we do with it? Oh?
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.700]   Translate yeah, yeah, we'll translate you know so
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.740]   Actually, I think
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.580]   One of our chatters has it right
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:24.980]   Which is where is it? I want to I want to give you a quote basically that Google's not a hardware
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.020]   manufacturer it's an information company it's an information company
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:34.460]   That's the quote or what you just said Google is in fact like Apple in the sense that it's it's no longer wowing us
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:42.100]   Well didn't they yeah, but Apple has wowed us with the iPhone 10 Apple is not a 100% consistent
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.820]   But they know how to manufacture
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:54.260]   And the air pods do exactly what the pixel buds don't and if it would behoove you if you take the headphone jack out of a phone
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.260]   To provide a good wireless
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.380]   Alternative or you've really just screwed your users
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:07.340]   And if you want wired ones, they're very few good USB C wired headphones
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.060]   Oh, are there any?
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.900]   There are like five and they give you an adapter so you could use any oh my adapter stopped working
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.900]   So I'm getting a new dog
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.220]   And how quickly you're gonna lose the adapter I just
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   Or do you buy five of them or I?
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.580]   But but yeah, it's it is really frustrating to take something out that worked
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   It's the only reason the size of this phone why can't I'm sorry?
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.500]   I just easy
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.300]   No, I was gonna say and it's my fault for buying you know the pixel phone
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.500]   But I really like being on stock Android and
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.660]   Google my god, I'm your most loyal customer here
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.820]   I mean these are the people who are like we love you Google we love Android
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:55.940]   Why must you screw us over we had the marketing director from one plus on all about Android last night yesterday the one plus five T
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.700]   came out and
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.860]   This might be the fault
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.900]   You know, I'm not gonna get it cuz I already have a pixel the camera isn't as good as the the pixel
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.140]   Why can't I click this so they not maybe they're not selling anymore?
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:15.940]   But this is kind of everything the pixel 2 XL should have been including a headphone jack and isn't
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.420]   Oh, maybe I should buy that maybe I should send my my hands sit back
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:26.460]   Yeah, well, this is the big big though. It's not it's more pixel 2 XL. It does have dual
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:34.300]   lenses I think Google has done one thing Google should really get credit for they have proven that they can do with a single lens
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:42.300]   Many of the same things the dual lens cameras do and and I think it's actually a better camera than the iPhone single lens and lots of processing
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.900]   Yeah, computational skill. Yeah
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:53.660]   But the one plus 5t is oxygen OS which is a really pretty pure Android experience
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:00.700]   So I yeah, I kind of regret now that I and by the way five hundred fifty bucks instead of
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.700]   8 or 900 bucks
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.420]   I've had a few four five hundred bucks for six gigs of ram and 64 gig storage
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:17.460]   But they actually make an 8 gig of ram version and 128 gig storage for 60 bucks more 559
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.020]   Yeah, the charging is really fast it charges from zero to a hundred in an hour. Oh
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:30.700]   I play Jason how has it I played it a little with it a little bit I came very close to ordering and I thought well
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.940]   I can't really justify it. I just bought this thousand dollar Google phone
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.780]   You could send it back. Yeah, I'm gonna send the pixel buds back or get them fixed
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:45.100]   That they didn't the you're right there because it's one size fits all if you don't like how it fits
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.220]   You're not gonna like it. It's it's kind of on top of the ear. You've got this big round thing. Yeah
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.260]   Yeah, my ears are really tiny. Yeah, my wife has the same problem
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.060]   She doesn't she tried them. She said can't use them. They're too big. She can barely use the airpods. I'm sorry Jeff
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.260]   What no no, I was just saying the same thing. I if they don't stick in the ear they're gonna fall out
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260]   I hate that feeling and it's not gonna work
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.340]   Again like a spider just perched there. I'll tell you I'm more disappointed than anything
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.100]   I really want there to be a good competitive environment
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:18.940]   You know HTC's gone by the wayside. I think Sony unfortunately although they make kind of nice hardware
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.860]   It's uninspiring and I don't really see the big future for them LG maybe
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:31.780]   One plus maybe but really the the king of Android has to have a reference design that is kind of top
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.740]   Flight and it's yeah, it's very disappointing. Oh
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.980]   We need the competition
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:44.740]   Although if anyone wants to share some nice wireless headphones that will not break the bank
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:51.700]   Feel free. Yeah, just share them the airpods the best right now, but it's not cheap. It's 160 or 150
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:58.980]   Yeah, it's definitely the best that's out there, but I can't use my earpods with this. Can I yeah any Bluetooth? Oh, yeah
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.140]   Just Bluetooth headphones
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.300]   You know you get more you get more features if you use it with an iPhone
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.500]   Just as you get more features if you use the pixel buds with a pixel - but it's do they also fall out of it feel like they're falling out of the ear a
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.060]   little bit
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.780]   Yeah, I can't they go a little farther in the ear
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.220]   But there but see the one thing I did like about the pixel buds
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.740]   They had that wire so if they fall out they're kind of there the your pot is just loose
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   Yeah, I don't mind the wire there pods you just
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.420]   flying free
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.900]   Fly free to their pots I
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.940]   Got my mini today
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:37.020]   Oh, oh, I got mine - I haven't got my coupon yet. Oh
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.380]   You kidding me. I said within a moment sure I didn't go into updates or something
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.940]   Yeah, let me go let me go to my Gmail. Maybe it went somewhere
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:51.460]   I wasn't looking like I was really impressed with I put it downstairs and I'm really impressed so far with Google's calendar efforts
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.740]   although
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.260]   I'm I find it hard to like I'm like oh it would be so cool if I could just tell it to put something on my calendar
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.020]   But it's really actually kind of hard to think through the process to say all the right words to put something on your calendar
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.860]   So that was a challenge problem all along, isn't it?
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.460]   Yeah, I'm like
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.180]   syntax
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.860]   an appointment for accounting at 4 p.m. on November 4th
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:20.060]   It's it got it and it got it when I said it a different way to although it didn't recognize accounting it said counting but that's fine
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.340]   It's close enough
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.340]   and it now has
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:30.660]   It personalizes so it can put my voice on my calendar and Andrew's voice on his calendar
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.900]   So I think this is specifically for Google home. They've added these these features
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.820]   You go to the Google Assistant setting scroll down to services
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:46.660]   There's a Google Calendar icon there. So you just kind of expand that menu out and you can
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.260]   You can you could choose a default calendar. Okay
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.740]   ability
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.820]   Okay, so there's more there's more stuff
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.100]   So and you saying it's doing a good job
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:09.020]   Ah, it's so hard because I have I'm you know like you I'm all in on the echo. I don't know if I want to assistance in every room
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:15.580]   Crisis right these are these minis are 30 bucks. I think with the black Friday deal
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.860]   Now both of you I would neither or which would you buy?
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:28.140]   Google Home actually we did our gift guide this morning and Google Home was our gift guide item or the Sonos one
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.140]   If you want two speakers in one
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.620]   So I would not do the echo. It's a big deal. That's interesting
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.620]   Yeah, cuz I I have I've been all in on the echo forever
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:45.100]   But Google is smarter and now it has almost every it doesn't have the June oven skill where I tell it to pre-ave my oven
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.460]   Which is how that's it echo does that
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.100]   Uh-huh. Yeah, have you not enabled the June oven skill? No
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:58.700]   Oh, what are you doing with your time? You could be telling no madam a to preheat the oven
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   That's a big problem in general with all of these is just what I call discovery the ability to figure out what the hell they can do
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.580]   And then turn it on and then remember it
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.540]   Well, that's true. Yes
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.940]   Andrew was actually mad at me when I was doing it because he's like you didn't tell me we could do that
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.260]   I'm like so sorry. You tell me either by the way
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   I'm so sorry I brought that June oven because of you now you know you
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.900]   That was also on our gift guy
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.860]   Yeah, I you know it was expensive, but I we use it all the time
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.860]   Lens is now rolling out to Google assistant. I have it. I have it. I have it
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.100]   Oh, so you take a picture something and it tells you what it is
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:44.260]   Yeah, so I'll do it. Let's find something and take some pictures of it. So I'm gonna take a picture of this item
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.540]   And it's gonna tell me see oh
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:54.700]   You can't read the good I found home if it says if it didn't know that I found this Google home
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.980]   So what so what all can you do with this lens?
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:05.460]   Just pointed at things and click on them and it'll tell you what it finds about them. It's a search query. It's not just
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.300]   Buying it. It's not just problems. No, no, no, it's anything. I
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.900]   Like the squeeze part of the assistant
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.860]   So how do I get it look at forgetting that?
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:21.140]   You know, so there's a bottom right go to a system on the bottom right
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.420]   There's a there's an icon click on that it opens the camera after I ask you camera yet. That's the problem
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.420]   Well, what does it look like?
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.300]   Looks like your normal assistant with a keyboard
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.140]   Show it to me close up. Where's the camera part? Oh, you're right poor Leo
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.940]   That's what I have to
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:44.420]   Yeah, so that now I have seen in photos. So if you take you can do that if you take a photo
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.300]   You can then post post Hawk
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.500]   Or is it propter Hawk post Hawk?
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.980]   You can take a picture here. Bring me a oh, yeah, let's see if it knows a tie fighter
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.220]   So I'll do a close-up of a tie fighter
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:05.300]   There we go. That's a that's a Star Wars thing for you people and then is that the lens icon?
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.540]   I can't remember with it. Yeah. Yeah, it says I'm not seeing this clearly
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.920]   Hmm that's is that the logo you're talking about Jeff with it?
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.540]   Yes, it's kind of a square incomplete square with two blue dots and a little kind of Instagram with a with a gap
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.420]   Yeah, I'm not seeing this clearly. What can Google lens do and then you can search the image on Google?
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.860]   Which of course will immediately find you oh it thinks it's origami
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:33.100]   It's not wrong. Maybe if I take a picture of the front
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.900]   The promise I do this stuff and then I go why is there all this crap in my Google photos?
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.260]   Are these pictures of weird things? Oh
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:50.140]   You know I have pictures of strange men because I'm always taking pictures of founders and people and my daughter like scans through my photos
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:55.540]   And is like mom this is pretty these guys so this I mean it's kind of cool
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.740]   So it does it acts like it's looking dot for dot right so it has all these dots moving around
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.940]   Which is just obviously a bogus animation it thinks it's model aircraft. That's close so Leo
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:12.540]   Take a picture of the logo behind you. Oh you think you'll know twit. Yeah
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.740]   I would I would be very happy if it knew that
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:26.380]   All right, I took a picture now you go into the photos you press this button watch the animation. It's so cool
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:33.020]   Hmm not seeing this clearly oh no, it looks like a stargate just did the logo ready?
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.020]   Oh, no, I'm not gonna okay. How about all right. We're gonna do this is so boring. How about your lunch?
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.780]   Yeah, yeah, I'll do my salad now. Here's see if it knows Batman
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:47.240]   But it's not your every day. That's not fair. Yeah, it's not that's kind of a funky Batman
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.420]   Batman fictional superhero it knew
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:56.140]   Character created by Bob Kane and writer Bill Fingar pulled up the Wikipedia result. That was pretty good
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.900]   Oh, I know I got one. I know it'll get
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.820]   Let's get this
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:08.500]   It might be the angle is fooling it and does it work better if there's nothing else in the image or is it pretty good at figuring out?
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.700]   It's not figured out. It doesn't know an android. Oh, you're kidding me
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:20.020]   I'm screenshotting that you know, what's harder for it is in is in the in the photo version
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.740]   You're actually you you click on the you you point out the thing itself
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:31.700]   That would make more sense which makes more sense. Yeah, it's too big a photo too much. It's too much to fruit to feed its little brain to figure out
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.220]   All right, there we go. We waste another 10 minutes
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:44.100]   I wish again we could talk about things like what would you like to talk about?
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.660]   Well, I'm looking at stories. I got to be honest guys. I have been like not paying attention to the news today, so
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.860]   Well, we got the big one in Peter teal
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.460]   Well, you see is decided that you don't need net neutrality. Well, let's take a break
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.540]   That's that's gonna that's gonna we're gonna spend some time with that very irritating

[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.460]   He's not getting another one
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:29.340]   Let's take a break. We'll talk about what the FCC plans to do what's going on what you can do about it what it all means

[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:56.380]   Thank you quick. Thank you quick. And so we knew it was coming. I'd you pie the chairman of the FCC the new Republican
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.460]   FCC there's I think three out of the five commissioners and now Republican
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.020]   That's what happens every you know every new president that they switched parties
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:11.540]   They have to though nominate equally from both parties and then the chairman can be whoever in this case a Republican
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.780]   former Verizon lawyer
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:21.860]   Adject pie former FCC commissioner announced his new net neutrality plan in December 14th. They'll vote on it
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:27.980]   It will assent he says I don't want to micromanage the internet
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:36.500]   I think that we don't need to regulate this these companies will do a fine job a fine job of
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:44.300]   You know making the internet free. He says net neutrality rules are heavy-handed. They are stifling the internet and
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:49.100]   Come December 14th. There will be no rules
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:53.780]   There will be no rules. These are the Obama era regulations
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.700]   We you know we've certainly been in the world without these regulations in fact
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.380]   It's only recently that they were the title three
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.940]   Regulations were put in a place by his predecessor Tom Wheeler title to title two
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.340]   Title three is another one title to thank you
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:15.060]   Ajit pie says president Clinton got it right
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.780]   Wow, and you never thought I'd hear that
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:24.700]   In 1996 when he established a free market-based approach to this new thing called the internet and the internet economy
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.420]   We have as a result of this light touch regulatory vision. Well that's that that sounds right. What's wrong with that?
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:40.620]   We saw companies like Facebook and Amazon and Google become global powerhouses with no net neutrality regulations precisely because we had light touch rules to apply this internet
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.700]   The internet wasn't broken in 2015
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.140]   When these heavy-handed regulations were adopted
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:57.180]   So maybe we're over exaggerating the negative potential negative consequences of this
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.700]   Will I give a jit pie give a jit pie a chance? Yeah, that's
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:09.740]   The other thing they're doing that's very infuriating is they're also saying by the way states don't bother making regulations on your own
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:15.020]   We'll handle this and I thought these people believed in states rights. No, no
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.780]   Oh, and someone in Texas. I'm sorry as someone who lives in Austin, Texas
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:24.180]   I can tell you that is most assuredly not the case since our legislators stripped us of all of our municipal rules
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.780]   Including being able to handle plastic bags and the size of trees
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.220]   That could be cut. Thank you
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.580]   I have lots of it
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:46.900]   Okay, so Austin won't let you trim or cut down trees of a certain size because we want to preserve the big trees, right?
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:57.380]   Apparently this really upset governor Abbott who when he was Attorney General lived in Austin and ran into the city and had an issue over his tree
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.060]   so
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.620]   this year
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:07.900]   He was like that was one of his examples that sanctuary cities and our plastic bag ban all really hacked him off
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.140]   So so the chairman's proposal which he calls
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.260]   restoring internet freedom
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.620]   order
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:25.220]   Would mark a shift in authority and emphasis instead of the FCC regulating how ISPs operate the federal trade commission
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:31.740]   Would handle enforcement of net neutrality violation some have said that's not gonna work very well. They're over burdened as it is
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:39.420]   Pie said the FCC will still require transparency any business practice that would affect the offering of a service
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.940]   Has to be disclosed to the consumers
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:48.260]   The ISPs have to create a publicly available web page where it's all spelled out and
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.500]   entrepreneurs can understand exactly how these businesses are
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:58.860]   Operated FTC had long authority long had authority and prior to 2015 and the result was pretty clear
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.660]   They took targeted action against the bad apples that everyone else thrive in a free market
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.900]   I think consumers and companies are better offers result. I you know that sounds that's pretty compelling
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.380]   Okay, so there's
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:18.340]   Like Jeff I'm going after it because this is something I know a lot about do it go for it
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.060]   All the way back to Jenna Kowski
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:27.340]   So way way back in 2008 timeframe as the internet got bigger
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:34.420]   There was always a question about the FCC did it even need to exist in the internet era
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:44.380]   So part of this isn't just hey, let's tackle net neutrality part of this is let's take as much away from the FCC as possible
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.220]   And you know, I think there is actually a valuable debate to be had over
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:58.180]   Do we need a particular regulatory agency has it outlived its time blah blah blah like we we still railroad commissioners
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:05.940]   They have a function, but you know, so that that's one thing. So part of this is just disempowering the FCC
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.140]   but and and then we get into these rules
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:20.660]   Doing anything on a case-by-case basis at the government level is always is almost always harmful to consumers
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.900]   if you think back to one of the big cases that launched this it was Comcast actually
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.740]   blocking bit torrent traffic and
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:34.180]   The case was all the way back. I think it started in 2007
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:41.100]   It took over 17 months to get Comcast to change its policies to not block bit torrent
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.100]   and so
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:49.660]   If there is harm it is possible the government will intervene absent actual rules
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.340]   but
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.060]   It's also a process that will take a long time in
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:02.780]   17 months in the life of like a startup or an app that people want to try to use and can't that will kill them
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.500]   done
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.540]   So that's that's one
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.020]   And I'll stop talking and that Jeff talks them to
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.340]   No, I was just gonna point to a link up on up
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.580]   Let me just before you do that
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:20.620]   I just want to back up Stacy's first point which is really an interesting point that I hadn't thought about that the FCC
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:27.140]   This is all really about eliminating the FCC because a week ago. They also relaxed their media ownership rules
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.340]   So that it used to be you couldn't
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.700]   Own more than two of the top four radio stations in this city
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.500]   You couldn't have a newspaper and radio stations that all of that's gone
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:44.460]   So media ownership regulations and that's really good for companies like Sinclair about to buy the Tribune Cup corporation
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.300]   It is adds to the consolidation of media voices in this country and I think that's a terrible
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:55.540]   Thing but it is exactly the same idea which is we don't need to regulate this stuff
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.220]   And here's the so I wrote a tweet
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.820]   Two days ago
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:06.180]   I think it's actually like the most popular tweet I've ever done and it's talking about all the things that the FCC is currently doing another
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.180]   Item that it's doing is it's saying that
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.140]   Because it used to regulate copper wires
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.900]   There's been a long-running process to eliminate copper and the FCC was like hey
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.860]   It's cool if you want to not have your copper network, but you got to have something equivalent there
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.660]   so you can't just rip out your copper and offer something crappy like satellite or
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.060]   Mobile broadband that's super expensive. What they're doing now is they're saying hey, you know what?
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:40.540]   Don't worry about that equivalency wireless is fine. That's good. So that is another sphere of influence where the FCC will
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.580]   No longer play. Yeah for a long time with Verizon put in Fios it would cut the copper
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.300]   Allegally and the homeowner was responsible for saying no no
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.220]   I want my copper lines so that I can leave if I want I can go to a competitor
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.740]   Once they cut the copper buy by you have to use Verizon Fios
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.820]   So that's an example of why you want to preserve some of this stuff
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:08.980]   Agit Pie says with this new these new media ownership rules the FCC is
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.620]   Dragging the broadcast rules into the digital age
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   So we don't you know maybe we are in a new era where we don't need an old-fashioned a commission like the FCC
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.220]   I think things like equal time if we had
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.260]   Competitive landscape. Yeah, I might agree, but we do not
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.780]   right
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.620]   At its core. This is still an anti-competitive
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:44.380]   Area and I think people like there is a false argument out there
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.700]   And I yelled at my former colleague Adam Lissinski about it this morning
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.420]   Which is that Google Netflix the original?
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.020]   Protectors of net neutrality from back in 2008
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:02.020]   They have all the power now and they don't need protection from the big guys and that's not
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:09.460]   That is true. These guys do have the power and actually about a year ago a lot of them weren't even worried about that neutrality
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.700]   They're kind of like shrugging it off. Yeah, Google's gonna be back and forth, you know, yeah
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.220]   Because it needs protection. Well, that's the point and not even to it
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.820]   Although admittedly I would like to make sure that we don't get discriminated against YouTube's gonna be fine
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.820]   They can afford it and that looks gonna be fine. They can afford it
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:31.460]   I can't afford to go through a toll road to get to our audience and it's not even me
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.940]   What about a new person an innovator wants to create the next Netflix or the next Google?
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:41.420]   They're gonna face all kinds of roadblocks truthfully. I think Facebook and Google
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.580]   Love this. This is what they secretly in their heart of hearts want
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.960]   It protects them. No, I think they have I think they have more principles than that a be
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:57.380]   The things that are gonna make them grow they see you the things that are gonna start they can buy and if things can't start they
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.740]   They are threatened with stagnation. Yeah Netflix
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:06.780]   Even said didn't even say we don't need that neutrality with we got this
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:13.100]   Because they can afford it, but in fact, it's what's the next Netflix gonna do, right?
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.100]   So look at the the link I put up from Portugal is
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.900]   Life with that. No, I'm sorry. Yeah. Yes
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.640]   That's okay. I've seen that make all over Twitter. We got to be really careful to
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:30.300]   I'm gonna ask the question was guys because I can't it was a Google translate and it looks like it's just for all these reasons
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:36.780]   Just give us 49 nine. Yeah, and a lot of people are using this as an example of what it will look like that you'll have to pay
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.860]   But what it really is is a telecom
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:44.140]   It's a cell carrier in Google in Portugal and we talked about this on the security now
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:50.620]   It's and somebody from Portugal explained. This is this is you're paying to be zero rated on these services, right?
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:56.620]   And it even unlimited zero rating you're paying to say how I'm gonna get two extra gigabyte
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.900]   This will pay for two more gigabytes on well, but wait wait wait wait wait
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.780]   Why is it BS if if they're separating out the
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:08.500]   They have it like for so they have a music is it looks like it is a music
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:14.860]   Yeah, but you're so certain services are included there and if you want to do Leo's musical hits from the 70
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.260]   You're not there
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.100]   You're left
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.500]   So this is zero rating which is a net neutrality issue
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   It's not exactly zero rating though because you're paying for it paying for it and
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:34.100]   It's a limited amount you're basically basically they're selling you a basket of additional bandwidth that covers these services now
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.660]   I agree. It's not neutral in the sense that doesn't cover all music services
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.660]   Well in wire so wireless is different. It's fundamentally different than wireline
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   So that's something to think about
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.620]   Yeah, there's the picture
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:53.060]   There's a reason why
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.980]   Wireline is
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.940]   Almost unlimited in the sense of how the packets get to you
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:05.300]   when you talk about wireless though, there's a limit to how many bits you can cram into a Hertz of spectrum and
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:10.860]   That is that is physics so it does cost more
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.180]   And you can't you can't
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:22.420]   Send out as much data over wireless as you can over like a fiber connection, right?
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.900]   So so that's a fundamental issue now
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.140]   Are we reaching those limits on a consistent and regular basis that I kind of doubt?
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:37.420]   There's a simple way to do this which is simply say here's our price per bit on
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:45.420]   Landlines here's our price per bit on wireless. It's gonna cost more and wireless because more expensive for us. That's that we don't care
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:51.940]   Well, okay, so so we just here's what it costs per bit and then that's yeah me that solves it, right?
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.020]   And if you say why want more bits
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.940]   I'll pay for it if I want more speed I'll pay for it and and I think that solves it
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.140]   But the problem is discriminating against individual bits and saying that's bits not the same as that bit
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.420]   Okay, so you can't measure just the bits
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:09.840]   You've also got to think about how many people are asking for certain bits at a certain time because congestion is
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.020]   Real on wireless networks
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.140]   Yeah
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.140]   But paying for the bits solves that as well because you if that many people
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.060]   You have to you would have to do it like a toll that would be congestion pricing you would have to do it on a toll
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.540]   Kind of basis so I get certain times yeah, right?
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:29.020]   And the challenge is and and I don't I mean I am I am very I
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.500]   Guess libertarian from an economic standpoint
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:40.660]   I don't necessarily think that a care like an ISP should charge should say okay
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.820]   It cost me five cents to deliver this bit and consider
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.940]   You know many of them have unionized workforces
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:52.540]   You've got to consider the cost that go into it from an infrastructure and ongoing maintenance, you know
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.020]   So once you account for all that it costs five cent
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:43:00.220]   Okay, that's incredibly expensive, but let's just say five cents per hundred megabytes or something
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.780]   But it
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.100]   Okay
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:08.900]   That is not so crazy. So you it costs this much. Yeah, and then I
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:16.900]   Think that they can charge whatever the heck they want as long as someone else can come in build that same
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.180]   infrastructure in charge less and
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.100]   That right now is where our policies
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.900]   We're trying to head didn't quite make it and so now we have this stupid
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.980]   Area where we've got only a few companies that actually have the
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:42.020]   literal capacity to offer broadband services and they can and that's why we're trying to regulate what they can and can't do because
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.420]   They're the only source for this fundamental
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:51.100]   Good infrastructure what you're really regular. It's the opposite of regulating as a Stacy. Aren't you saying that?
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:56.700]   This is the internet. Here's what you can't mess up isn't it kind of a negative?
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.980]   Sure, I mean, it's it's this is this is the internet
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:09.140]   You can't charge exorbitant rates because we don't have a competitive market basically like normally if we'd have a competitive market here
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.540]   Like let's say we put conduit in
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:17.020]   Let's say everybody who put in fiber had to either share it or just put in conduit
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:23.820]   Then we wouldn't have this problem. We would have other people coming in to offer these services. I just like BT
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:30.300]   Like BT although BT has gotten in trouble in the past for the way it's tried to price people
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:38.140]   Amsterdam is probably the best in most famous example, but Amsterdam is a city Amsterdam has dark fiber and everyone
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.700]   Anyone can run
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:47.380]   Run a service over it. Anyway, Amsterdam also says that broadband is basic, right?
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.260]   That's a model
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.420]   I really like and many people have talked about this that the
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:59.020]   municipalities the localities should own the infrastructure and then rent it out to ISPs to ride on top of it and
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.420]   And then you'd have more competition
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.820]   We failed at that back in the facility
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:09.900]   Yeah, but when we when we did the telecommunications act back in 1996
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:17.260]   We decided our competition was cable versus copper and the companies that own it will always own it and you can't take that back
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.220]   I mean these companies have made a legitimate investment
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.780]   so it becomes this weird game of like
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.860]   If they behave badly, how do we stop them?
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:33.620]   And that's what the net neutrality rules were for because the operators were behaving badly
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:38.260]   You can't actually you could take it back with eminent domain and
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:44.460]   You could all in many cases for instance the cable company and in most towns and ours certainly
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:51.300]   operates as a monopoly franchised by the city the city council said yeah Comcast you are incumbent and
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:58.460]   If if Comcast loses that contract they don't come take all their cable out of the ground. They just go goodbye
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:04.580]   Well, they don't know they don't get to pay off. Well, I'm not sure how those contracts work. Has that ever happened?
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.340]   That's a really interesting question
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.300]   I was actually serving on the technology committee for the city of Petaluma where we debated this
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:17.660]   But I just think politically it's very difficult because in effect you're telling your constituents. Yeah, we're not gonna have cable for a while
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:22.500]   Or your Comcast is not gonna be your cable company. Suddenly it's Cox
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.300]   It's usually come invest in your town and install things right?
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:31.940]   Well, I mean you can make the case that they have made back their investment in the infrastructure
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.700]   I mean, I don't it's they'll make the case that they're always in in in the red
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.620]   But that's clearly not the future
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:46.740]   But see I do think that I guess what I'm saying is I think there are it's not completely without merit to say well
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.420]   There might be a way to make this work without government regulation
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:57.420]   I think government regulation is is a tricky in of the internet. That's tricky. It is and
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:02.940]   Others have pointed out we're not regulating the internet. We're regulating the companies that provide the internet
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.460]   But yes, I don't know if that's a distinction with a difference with a distinction or a distinction with a difference
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:12.420]   No, I think it's actually a really important is it distinction. I have no problem regulating Comcast
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:18.500]   That's not a problem. They are regulated. They should continue to be regulated. They're regulated in other ways as well
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:24.260]   So Stacy is that is that the better way to say what I asked you a minute ago that the internet is
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:29.060]   Unregulated ergo you who come along and screw it up. We regulate you
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.740]   I'm trying to come up with a prop with it. No, I feel like I feel like the internet
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.460]   Should be treated like
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:47.940]   Infrastructure. Yes, so like roads like like water and utilities. Yeah, they're you till um
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:56.460]   So you should not the service is upon it so Google's not a utility, but the wires are
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.100]   Right now if we want to talk about regulation though
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.900]   So there is I think we should be having a conversation. It sounds like we might be getting it
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:13.860]   About the power that has accrued to companies like Google and Facebook by virtue of their massive data stores
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:21.260]   I think that's an interesting debate that people are gonna start having but that is totally separate from net neutrality
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:28.140]   And people who equate well Google and all have all this power, you know, I'm like, yeah, sure fine
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:34.340]   Let's talk about regulating them if you want but that doesn't it it's a false equivalency in the net neutrality debate
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.540]   Google may not need to take advantage of it. I'm gonna give you guys an assignment. I
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.100]   Would like there's a couple of things I think we need first of all
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:47.340]   I think we need a way to describe this to normal people and in general that a
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:56.740]   Acknowledges that there are two sides to this that explains it clearly that's by the way the biggest problem right now is the American public has no
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:01.980]   Idea what net neutrality means or why it would impact them and in a way that's persuasive
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:09.500]   For I think what we all agree which is that the that the internet needs to be free and open and
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.100]   Bits all bits should are created equal
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:18.140]   But how do we how do we express that in a way that people will get and support?
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:25.020]   Leo I have written probably 50,000 words on this topic and I still don't know how to do it. Yeah, so
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.020]   It's a challenge about this
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:33.620]   The FCC just turned the internet into your cable company
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:39.740]   Everybody hates their cable company and the structure basically is the same the cable company gets all the power
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.820]   They decide to what you get they bundle things at their own will they decide what you can and can't do
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.220]   They overpriced charge you for it
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.140]   The FCC just turned the entire internet into your cable
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:55.300]   Well, the cable companies are kind of getting screwed though now by like broadcast
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.500]   rebroadcasting rights and some of these by some of the content companies, which is
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.300]   meaning their power is
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.260]   What's the word?
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.020]   dissipating somewhat?
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.700]   Yeah, but you don't say all I'm trying to say is I think Leo was asking for what tugs of your emotional heartstrings
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.620]   How about I all hate our cable company? Let me let me oh, yes, that's true, but I also think it's not I
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.060]   Mean we've seen those pictures of if the internet were run by the cable company
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.220]   you would buy you know you'd buy the premium package which include YouTube and
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:32.100]   and and you had Skype and if you didn't want to pay that much you get the medium package which it included my own Vimeo and
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.940]   Tango
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:37.540]   And and that's I don't I honestly
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:42.460]   Don't think that's gonna happen. I don't think it's gonna be as obvious and as
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:50.020]   Awful is that I really think it's gonna be more subtle things like shape and with shaping or blocking bit torrent
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.140]   I don't think they're gonna come out and say okay if you want access to YouTube as a buck more months
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:51:00.700]   I know I can't imagine that actually happening if it does then you really then people are gonna be up in arms back in the day
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.700]   They would have been free to watch Skype
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.220]   That would have happened
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:13.500]   So so that that'll happen in like 10 years or maybe five years even we will go from I can't believe they're doing that now
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.020]   remember I mean
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:21.900]   What'll happen slowly is there will be bandwidth shaping and maybe there will be some form of zero rating
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:26.900]   It's kind of like what the airlines have done with like charging people for basic economy
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.500]   So what you'll end up with is a more fee-based internet
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:35.260]   Yeah, if you had asked me 10 years ago, you think an airline would ever charge you for carry-on. I'd laugh at you
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.860]   So I think I think you might be in that same position today
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.260]   it's a
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.100]   little
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.580]   in the
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.020]   in the
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:49.860]   Carriers and ISPs bless their hearts. They will go rush down that slope faster than you can imagine
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.500]   because
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.180]   They can and because these these are companies
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.780]   That are not
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.780]   innovative that are
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:08.180]   Designed around aching the most profits that they can out of this massive
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:13.140]   infrastructure investment and that is a mindset and it's not an incorrect mindset
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.940]   It's from an era a long time ago. So
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.820]   If you think about it like that
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:24.580]   Then you understand where they're coming from and I think that's respectful of both sides
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:29.260]   I mean, it's just a mindset that feels utterly foreign in this era
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:33.660]   Here's an analogy I got from reddit that I thought was not too bad a
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.980]   Redditor asked to explain what you know, why net neutrality is important
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:46.140]   Said well imagine that you have a librarian town and you you pay for a library card 20 bucks a year whether you use it or not and
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.860]   So you go to the library the librarian is very helpful
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:55.340]   But then when you go to check out some books, she says well those books are gonna cost more
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:01.420]   Like that book I wrote so that's gonna I'm gonna give you that for free this book
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:05.860]   I agree with so I'm gonna give you that for cheap these books. I don't want you reading
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.780]   I'm not gonna give them to you and the rest. I'm gonna charge you 20 bucks for
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:15.100]   So you say well, that's no problem. I'll just go to the other library in town. Oh wait
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.660]   There isn't one
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:24.020]   Does that kind of a good analogy? Is it like that and will that happen? Will a cable company say
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.780]   Tier will they tier the internet? I
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:32.900]   Think they've tried to tier the internet remember when time Warner cable wanted to tier the internet back in like 2008
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.340]   Oh, that was good times good times
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:41.840]   Somebody said somebody said just wait until you really want to see people scream bloody murder wait until
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:49.340]   Comcast says well, you can't get any free porn, but you're more than welcome to subscribe to Cinemax
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.060]   Just just wait till that happens
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:58.660]   I think I think the better case will be it's it's things that you don't recognize as brands
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.580]   David
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:07.660]   We'll cut off a bit torrent. We'll cut off a phone call Skype will cut off some new protocol
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:13.580]   That's hungry. We'll we'll disadvantage it will sell you a service that guarantees the value
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:19.020]   It's like also going to hotels. We're gonna give you a purposely crappy service
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:25.580]   For our advertised free Wi-Fi in your room. Yeah, we're gonna charge you a ridiculous amount of money
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.940]   Actually, it will be like hotel Wi-Fi
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:37.980]   Which lie about it being Wi-Fi about being high speed and then rips you off and trying to to charge you to get to minimal
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:45.140]   Standards of accessibility and then fails at that as I prove on every trip in which I try to be on this show I
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:51.740]   Think it's gonna be really hard to convince people part of the problem is you'll never know what you're not getting
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.740]   You'll never know about the innovative
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:02.420]   Because they want from an IOT perspective. I always say in and there's some interesting I
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:09.900]   Probably too much nuance here, but from an IOT perspective. I tell people oh, hey, you know Comcast has a security offering
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.380]   Maybe they just will say your nest cam. Let's deprioritize those packets
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:20.460]   Yeah, and then you may or may not know but you know it happened with Netflix remember Comcast
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:26.260]   So that was peering and I don't know if we want to talk about peering because that is a different layer of the internet
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:33.100]   But I am happy to dive into it because that's that story. Here's why it's germane. It's an example of how
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:40.140]   Comcast could disadvantage a company by just not buying more interconnects, right?
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.060]   Just we're not gonna buy more interconnects until you give us some money
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.780]   So that I mean I think that's another way to disadvantage. Yeah, I think that that's
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:53.820]   relevant to the conversation and that's at the utility layer, right? Which is
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.820]   What we should have be open and competitive right?
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:02.700]   You get the internet you deserve and I think that I
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:11.620]   Can't well for one thing the FCC has shown that is completely willing to disregard any public comment even lie about that's another issue
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.140]   Yeah, so this is a totally different issue and
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:22.660]   It is very upsetting what is happening with public access to information to meetings and the
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.360]   willingness to listen to comments. So the FCC is one
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:33.260]   Austin just got sued again for public information act violations. I'm feeling like the entire world is just oh
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:37.180]   Guys, okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:45.900]   I some you just funny yesterday. I was feeling kind of similar I was feeling I was I you know the worst thing you can do is despair ever
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:54.060]   But I was perilous. How do you know it's kind of hard sometimes when you just one after another these you know
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.380]   Things happen and you just how could it get any worse? Oh, it did
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.420]   My wife is taking to watching tennis reruns now
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.660]   To something or some recreation
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:08.100]   Yeah, that's that's my yeah, like I want to have faith in the government Jake said last time
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.820]   He's going upstairs where you got home for things gonna be said I'm gonna go watch fiction
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:20.980]   Well, so now I'm despairing again. No, let's not despair. Let us let us contemplate
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:27.620]   But what happens is bad behavior at the highest levels in genders bad behavior lower down and what is yes?
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.220]   People don't understand how tenuous a
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:38.940]   Nation of laws is how tenuous a republic is it is easy to corrupt it from the top down very easy
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.820]   It happens quickly you we've seen it happen in Turkey. We've seen it happen in Greece
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.780]   It is very easy. I've seen it happen in Egypt
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.580]   as soon as there is a
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:53.780]   lack of respect if soon as there's a sense is not fair as soon as it you don't feel like it's the
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.940]   We have the rule of law it crumbles
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.900]   Instantly I'm reading right now
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.660]   rereading the rise and fall of the third Reich, which is of course the classic William L
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:09.460]   Shirer book about the rise and fall of Hitler and in the point where he is right coming to power and it's
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   terrifyingly familiar
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:20.940]   Everybody thought he was a buffoon by the way the Americans thought ill now you don't have to worry about this guy
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.580]   I'm never gonna be a chance. What are you crazy? He's in that he's in that job
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:34.140]   So can I follow up on an earlier story by the way Hitler did everything he said he would
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.100]   Yep
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:41.700]   20 years before it was all laid out and everybody's oh he won't know he'll be much more
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:47.220]   Presidential when he's a chancellor. Yeah, yeah, so why do you think Comcast is gonna magically change?
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.940]   No, you're right. I'm just look I was playing devil's advocate. I
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:54.860]   But I do think it's important if we're gonna have this conversation in public
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.940]   that we
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:02.220]   Acknowledge that there is might be some merit to the other point of view and figure out a way
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:08.100]   That's what politics is that we can come to a mutual agreement that's been that everybody agrees
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.860]   Yeah, this is you're dealing with rational people rational interests
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:16.500]   They are so well are we talking about the ISPs or are we talking about Trump?
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:21.980]   I think we could step if stipulate the Comcast is greedy and Comcast is gonna mod a maximize profits again
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.500]   I would say okay
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.380]   greedy maximizing profits maybe again
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:33.500]   I say look at that worldview and also and I will tell you I am pro net neutrality because I am pro consumer
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.860]   but I spent
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.380]   years
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:45.460]   Talking to engineers at telcos and cable companies and I understand at a very fundamental level how these networks work
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:52.700]   So I can understand their arguments. Yes, and so I would say yes when I'm talking to you guys about stuff
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:58.460]   I am putting that perspective in there. That's why I can explain wire line and physics, right?
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   But why we're gonna let it have you here
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:08.060]   No, I agree with you. I agree with you. That's you bring that perspective. Yes, but with your point about politics Leo
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.140]   you have a
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:16.260]   World where we believe in states rights except when it comes to this and no you can't the state can actually decide on the city
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.300]   Can actually decide to do its own internet rules. Sorry
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.820]   But I mean that's you know, it's that it's same as it ever was
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.860]   I mean going back to the founding fathers
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:32.380]   This is you know everybody pretend you got a world you a party that says we believe in pull pushing down to the states
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:37.860]   Except in this case we're on a loud drive you believe in the one hand that we should open up all ownership
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.260]   Regulations run newspapers and TV stations. We should listen Claire merge with Tribune going way beyond the old bounds
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.780]   But CNN no no no you can't be part of AT&T. Is it unlike you?
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.220]   The you're dealing with inconsistent
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:57.740]   Politically motivated emotionally motivated people then your effort to find that common ground negotiation falls apart
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:05.540]   That's all. Yep. If you know Comcast is greedy you can figure out how to deal with that you can serve the greed
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:11.980]   But when you're dealing with people who are irrational or doing things for spite, it's a lot harder. Yeah and
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.220]   Speaking of spite
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.860]   Yes to update our earlier story
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:22.220]   It appears that Peter Thiel is trying to buy the assets of gawker.com
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.100]   So that he can shut it down
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.540]   So we can erase the archive
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:32.020]   Okay, so just for those who don't know gawker.com
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.860]   Which was founded by Nick Denton and was a scandalous
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:43.400]   Website that spoke truth to power and sometimes pretty much presage the entire sex stories were going through right now
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.320]   Yeah, in fact in many cases that they were the first report of Louis C K's rumors for instance, but
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.200]   They went a little one step too far when they
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.640]   published a sex tape of Hulk Hogan and
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.500]   Hulk Hogan went to sue them in Florida court, but unbeknownst to us
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:07.040]   Hulk's lawsuit was funded by this billionaire Peter Thiel because Peter Thiel had his own
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.460]   Exstagride with gawker because they had I think inappropriately outed him some years before as a gay man
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:17.960]   And he didn't like that so much so he was happy to have this lawsuit
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.800]   Funded it and won and essentially bankrupted Nick Denton and gawker Nick sold
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.320]   gawker - I forgot
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.520]   Somebody but fusion fusion. That's right fusion has the
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.220]   Univision fusion so the Univision has the I guess has the assets. I know the
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.160]   That was not sold the gawker
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.320]   Was not sold it is it is in the estate of the company once known as gawker.com
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:54.720]   So those so those pages are still up. That's the point is there's somebody's trying to buy that in the bankruptcy court
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.920]   Because that's what's still in bankruptcy and teal is saying that he's the most qualified buyer Wow
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.320]   Well, I can't I mean if he takes it all down, I wouldn't be unhappy
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.600]   I would
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   It's a bad
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.840]   It's a bad story
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.400]   But you know they did they kind of did the same thing to me that they did the Peter Thiel and I'm not a public figure
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.880]   I'm not I you could say well you need you know
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.920]   I agree you need to out people who are using their power and and doing bad things
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.840]   But they they also were completely willing to publish you know
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.480]   Solacious yeah, sometimes untrue gossip is a as a means to generate page views as well
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.400]   Let's not forget that and I don't think it was right for them to out Peter Thiel. That's not germane to any conversation
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.440]   Well, I think it was I mean
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.160]   I'm not arguing that it was right too, but it was one of those open secrets that they were like you know
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.880]   I let's just pop it out there kind of like Kevin Spacey
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:53.920]   But now that's out there that's different Peter Thiel being gay is not doesn't mean there was no assertion that he had
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.200]   molested people or anything wrong or illegal
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:05.360]   It was actually a tribute a piece that was in tribute. Oh, and yeah, I think as far as a cocker was in tribute to anything
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:11.080]   Yeah, but I understand why by Peter would be pretty upset about it. I don't know a little that
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.520]   He doesn't have to sell his facebook stock to afford. He can afford gocker.com
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.960]   He could tits his lunch money probably
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.120]   Wow, so is Nick selling it off? Is that what's going on? Oh, no, it's the estate. It's in bankruptcy
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.480]   So the the the creditors I guess own it whatever that maybe it's not dead
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:37.360]   It's not the estate. It's the no company has an estate. Yeah, really company has a little bit. Oh, I apologize
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.360]   You knew what you're talking about
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.080]   So the so the assets of gocker are still lying around
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.560]   Wow
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.080]   He was apparently not told that that could have played a part. Yes
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.640]   Hmm
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   That would be kind of
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:03.560]   But he was not Shakespearean a creditor of any sort right it was it was it was it was um
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.640]   Oh, they know him money. Oh, actually they might have oh, Hulk Hogan might have had more rights
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.800]   I think in this case you might be owed and Peter Thiel what Peter Thiel was just the funter
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.000]   He he had no he had no standing Hulk might own my
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.680]   Hulk might have said I'll give you half of the settlement or
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:26.440]   Hulk will buy gocker comm and then so it's Peter Thiel and make even more money. Yeah, I don't think that would be bad
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.000]   Oh, I know you guys. I'm I'm not that person
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:41.980]   What else do you want to talk about oh, there's more there's more
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.840]   We did we just are you satisfied that we've we've done the net neutrality thing
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:56.560]   I mean, I think all that yeah, it's not a done deal by any means Congress might intervene the courts certainly will intervene
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   there will be lawsuits galore and
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:06.240]   You know, I mean the you know, maybe your internet will get more expensive. Maybe some startups that would have been nice won't
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.800]   And and maybe who knows your cable company to come to you with a tier plan that says you have to pay more if you want
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.120]   to see YouTube so here. I'll say one thing and
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.240]   this is just
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   Part of all in keeping with despair. So I wrote a little something
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:29.760]   About net neutrality in what is most frustrating
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.560]   Is that we have spent so much time and effort
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.040]   Loving this educating people about this regulating this and we regulated it
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.840]   Although we started this process all the way back in like
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.720]   2005 with those pillars of the open internet from chairman Michael Powell after
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.760]   God a tiny ISP
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.200]   Green River in I think Wisconsin was blocking Skype. So
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.920]   There were actual harms. We debated them
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.720]   For years
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.800]   We actually created rules went to court court said no you got to create them this way
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.240]   so then we created new rules which were the 2015 Tom realt the rules and
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:22.080]   That's what government is supposed to do that is what we do and then to have someone come in after the fact
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.080]   And just take it away like it wasn't causing problems
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:34.320]   We have not seen a decrease in investment from the ISPs. We have not seen problems on their end
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.040]   To take it away
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:44.440]   Smacks of corruption it is a step too far. It's just it's so frustrating to me to see this because
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:50.600]   The way forward would be to say okay, let's find the actual problem and address that
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.320]   not to
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.880]   recent rules that we made in response to an actual problem and maybe this is just me but it's
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   Well said come read that's yeah
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.920]   So okay
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.760]   We want a letter note. Yeah, please. Yeah, please you could now have a Marta bus drive in front of your Facebook
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:17.520]   I thought that was very funny. That was this is what the internet is for this is so exactly
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:24.740]   They were blowing up the Georgia dome imploding it as it were and was it the weather channel that was
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:29.380]   Weather channel was was broadcasting listen to the countdown
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.720]   And just as is about to implode
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.160]   Here comes the bus
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   Flocking the view
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:53.000]   I laughed like pride
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.720]   It's the guy who's swearing is he like from the weather check I think so
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560]   Oh, you missed it
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:13.480]   Well now somebody has set up a thing so you can have a Marta bus and a bus drive in front of your Facebook
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.480]   Oh, really? Oh really? Oh
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:24.120]   Oh, I want to do the last for about 36 hours. Oh, I'm gonna do that on my that's awesome. Are you doing that? No
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:34.160]   This is the this is the internet. This is what it's good for is what if what if you could not create those silly little apps because
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.600]   Right there
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:43.080]   Okay, so wait a minute search for dome
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.480]   implosion
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.120]   Okay, so
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.400]   So this is where you where you where you go and then you you can search for a theme
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.240]   dome implosion
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.280]   Okay, all right here we go and then I'm
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:07.320]   You can drag it. Yeah, okay there actually that's a pretty good. I'm gonna do that. That's my new profile picture
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:13.040]   I like it. I like it. It looks like I'm looking right over the bus. That's perfect
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:19.760]   This is most I should go to drive in I don't think it moves. I think it's just good. Did you just pop a cool one there Stacey?
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.120]   It's sparkling water, but yes
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.960]   Is it what do you call it topo moco? It's not a topo Chico topo Chico
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:33.360]   It's just a straight up H e B sparkling water or as Jeff Jarvis and I would say topo G. G. Oh
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:41.160]   Or a seltza seltza seltza there was there were do you remember the Seltzer sisters in San Francisco? No, oh
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   God, yeah, we're two women who bought all the old seltzer bottles and we're delivering seltzer to your door in classic
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.360]   20s yeah glass seltzer bottles and when you
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.160]   Finished them you would put the empty just like in the three stooges where they put the seltzer down your path
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.360]   And then when you were done with it you put it on your doorstep and you get a new delivery the seltza sisters
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.120]   I had them on my old radio show and can be hard to make an egg cream for us all
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.520]   Mmm, there is no egg and egg creams
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:17.560]   Right just chocolate syrup and so I never liked the lunch. Wait. Did you know that pumpkin pie filling doesn't have pumpkin pie in it?
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.560]   No, it does too though
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:25.700]   Is it okay butternut squash is pumpkin pie filling really cuz I love butternut
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.360]   What is that isn't this is what I learned?
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.380]   This is what I learned. Did you look at the can how did you know?
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.280]   No, um, it was a
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:44.440]   2014 Huffington Post article. Here's why your pumpkin pie probably has no pumpkin in it at all
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.200]   It's a butter not squash pie, but if you called it that
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:56.120]   Nobody would eat it. Oh, here's this is from kitchen. What's actually in your canned pumpkin puree?
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.920]   Well, you know, but I know squash is better
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.840]   The label says a hundred percent pumpkin
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:10.720]   But apparently the F this is good the FDA says pumpkin and squash close enough
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.360]   the canned product prepared
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.440]   From clean sand properly matured golden-fleshed firm-shelled sweet varieties of either
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.200]   pumpkins and squashes
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:28.160]   By that's what's that's by washing stemming cutting steaming and reducing to a pulp that can be called pumpkin. Oh
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.200]   Look from time.com relax that canned pumpkin isn't actually squash at all. Oh
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.520]   You see another in a net means squashed
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.600]   pumpkin
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.520]   Now I just read I did read somewhere that pumpkins were actually
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:51.400]   It's a generic term for like an orange squash. Oh, so there you go. That is
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:58.200]   We always we always use sugar pumpkins the little sugar pumpkins for the pumpkin
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.760]   And I know I know yeah, I wouldn't use a can of lilies
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.080]   But I wouldn't use real pumpkins and you know there's real pumpkins in there
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.440]   Can I tell you my my this is why I can't cook really stupid pumpkin pie story really quickly? Yes
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.960]   So in my young adult days when I was trying to impress a young lady and thought I would show her how
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:21.080]   Multi-talented I was I wanted to cook dinner. I did the same thing. Yes
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.640]   So I got a recipe for my mother for the pie that I love pumpkin chiffon pie
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:30.120]   And the recipe was written out in that in that pumpkin that recipe ease which I didn't quite understand
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.120]   So I got to the one and one half
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.560]   See period canned
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:41.640]   Pumpkins, so I thought that's really stupid because the sizes are different but fine. I took a can of a can of another half of Jesus
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.360]   Luckily, it stayed together as a glob
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.960]   So I could then calculate before there was a was a google how much I had to measure and take out
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.080]   To make you pumpkin pie
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.680]   Because I had to buy everything including salt and pepper for that pie
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:01.000]   I think of the cup pie at the time in in pre-adjusted dollars cost me $29
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.320]   Wow
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.220]   Jeff and it didn't she was unimpressed
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.200]   Of course the chat room has found
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.360]   video of the seltzer sisters
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.080]   Yes, we do it. That's kind of an interesting thing we have with us too young ladies
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.000]   Coast they're called the seltzer twins and they have come up with a brand new business. That's a
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.480]   Ross McGinnan good morning San Francisco
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.000]   They were married I can't remember
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.240]   I'm afraid of silver and I want to
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   It was an anon Ross
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.560]   Look at the hair. This is 91. You know you can do the same
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:43.080]   I love you do with the old seltzer bottles only you can do the same thing
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.920]   Couldn't you with perhaps calistoga water? Oh, no, what is we look at those bottles?
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.000]   That's what they looked like they were as good
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.680]   This is about triple the carbonation and it does not contain any salt
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.480]   Uh-huh very important because a lot of folks say oh boy
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.360]   I'm really gonna lose weight if I stick with that stuff not necessarily right
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.080]   How did you guys happen to come up with the idea?
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.560]   Morning television nothing worse
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:14.200]   Are we worried that google is collecting android users locations even when location services are disabled thus they say they will stop it by the way
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:19.640]   So this is an errand this is where i'm like, you know guys as we connect things to the internet
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.080]   We have to actually think about what those things do the data they collect and what happens to it
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:31.000]   I mean google's response to this was basically like, yeah, we were trying something out. We didn't realize it. Okay, we'll stop
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.160]   so
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:40.520]   Like in january of this year says google we began using cell id codes as in the the the code from the tower
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.160]   As an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of mesh message delivery
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:51.560]   However, we never incorporated cell id into our network sync system so that data was immediately we discarded and we updated it
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.240]   To no longer request cell id but for briefly for a few months they were
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:00.600]   From the beginning of the year collecting where your cell tower what nearest cell tower was
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.160]   Even if location services were turned off
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.360]   This seems to me to be a tempest in a teapot, but I
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:14.280]   No, no, it's a legit issue. I mean, I think if you say you're not collecting location service or location data and you actually are
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:21.480]   Yeah, but I mean if you think about the actual operation of a cell phone requires it to figure out what cell tower acts on
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   I mean, it's kind of
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.480]   Admittedly, that's the carrier doing that and they don't they obviously discard it
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.680]   But you're fine kind of has to know where it is in space
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.360]   Right, but google collecting that information is a new party collecting that information
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:42.760]   And google has a lot of other information about you right? I can see why it's an issue. I can see
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:49.720]   I mean remember remember street view collecting all that Wi-Fi data, right? That was that was even more
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.760]   accidental and both right. I'm not saying it's
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.640]   Malicious. I'm just like guys
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.680]   But the problem is each of these things is presented as if it is malicious
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.320]   Well, that's the medium
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.520]   I love I love us in the media, but you know, I hate it
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.480]   Well, even Steve Gibson who is normally very conservative about this kind of thing and you know really
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.280]   I don't want to say paranoid, but paranoid
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.920]   Even he said look if you're carrying around a cell phone
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.840]   You're kind of carrying around a location device. I mean that's just if you don't want that
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.240]   I mean, that's kind of the nature of how cell phones work. It's just
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.840]   And you know google says we're not gonna do anymore. We we never meant to keep this data
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.000]   I'll give them the benefit of that on this one. I'm glad they got caught. Let's put it that way
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.840]   It's good. They got caught
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.760]   Yeah, and I think it's important that companies like pay attention to this stuff, right?
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:45.720]   Because someone someone could actually if that data is going someplace somebody who notices it could actually take advantage of it
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.000]   Yeah
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.360]   And that's that's not great. Hey an update to our story about weird kids videos
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.320]   on youtube they've taken down
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.600]   uh
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.360]   a kids quote
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:04.440]   Channel exploitive kids channel called toy freaks and they are tightening their child in den in dangerman
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.840]   Now I want to see toy freaks
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:13.000]   Apparently criticized for it's like that vile and seemingly exploitive videos featuring a dad and his daughters
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   Which man he said bordered on abuse
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.840]   Jesus wow, and that's a different problem here. Yeah
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.080]   They were enforcing their child in dangerman policies
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.720]   Geez did anybody stay safe? Did you ever see this?
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:33.640]   Um no because I I don't like videos of kids put in distressing situations. Yeah, I don't blame you but but you know, so this wasn't
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:38.360]   A channel aimed at kids. I this is teenagers love this
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:44.440]   My son used to watch you know your daughter will get old enough where she my son used to love watching what they call fail videos
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.680]   Which is just
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.760]   People are hoping out. Yeah, it's like but worse
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:54.840]   It's just wiping out after wipe out after wipe out it looks like horrible maiming and disfigurement is happening
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   And he just howl and laugh and that's just you know, that's how people are
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.200]   Uh
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.440]   Michael our 14 year old used to love those what is the and it turned out they were fake
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.720]   But whatever I thought they were real I first saw him the one with the dad
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.960]   Gets mad his son because he's playing videos games all day and he takes all his video games
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.640]   Puts him out on the lawn and mose them with his riding mower
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.200]   And the kid just goes crazy
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.280]   And it turned out then they made a whole bunch more of them and it turned out the whole thing was a great act
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:27.800]   But the and I imagine that's the same thing with toy freaks and kids and teenagers, you know, they love this
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.520]   They's a little transgressive feels a little dangerous
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.560]   And the thing is they were probably making a lot of money
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.360]   And these are pretty little kids
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.800]   Yeah, you know and ana bell freaks out when a real spider attacks her
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.880]   You know and these are these are little kids. So the dad probably is kind of
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.960]   I mean exploiting his children a little bit
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.840]   But the kids are you that they love it parents on social media are exploiting their children all the time
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:02.280]   Parents have done this since showbiz was invented
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.920]   Right stage mom
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.160]   Hey very good news for people who use uh echo shows, which I know isn't a lot of you
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:14.040]   I love the echo show that's the echo amazon echo the screen youtube's back
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.840]   my corgi videos are bad
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:20.040]   corgi's at breakfast
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:23.240]   And you can watch this show you can say echo
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.800]   Watch not listen watch this week in google on youtube
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:32.760]   And it will play it unfortunately it plays it in before it had a really nice kind of full screen in her face
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.840]   Now plays it as if you're looking at the youtube web page and I think what happened
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920]   I don't know but I'm guessing google said no
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.000]   No, we want people to see those coming up next videos and auto playing the next video and all that stuff
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.080]   We put a lot of time into that
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   Can you leave our interface alone?
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:56.440]   Is it uh go ahead good or scooter access amazon says that saying that i'm a zoom in will swap to full screen mode
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.040]   Yes
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:03.000]   Yes, that's not quite the way it used to be but it is good so echo zoom in
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.240]   Is it the case it's just or is it just me that whenever you see mark zucker burg out in public
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.200]   He looks like data the android from star trek
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.880]   Doesn't he just kind of
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.760]   Does it's there's something if you were if you were him how would you
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:22.280]   You have how could you possibly have a self image?
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.640]   Except knowing that your constantly on camera. Yeah, I guess it's like being it's like being raised in the white house
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.840]   Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm sure baron baron trump will look like that in a few years
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.000]   Uh interesting article lexis c madrigal writing in the Atlantic the education of mark zucker burg
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.560]   He's been the 30 states now
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:47.000]   Like quoted part of this when I saw it on the rundown on twitter and drove me a little bit nuts
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.880]   Um, where is it here?
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:56.360]   Most recently for example, this was how he described his major takeaway from his travels at the concluding stop of the university of kansas
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:02.120]   Quote the thing that struck me everywhere I went and I have stories from every state that I visited was how central communities are the people
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:09.160]   He said you don't say says madrigal this level of naivete sounds unbelievable. You know f me
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.720]   Media which you're part of we're a little cynical. Aren't we?
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.520]   You never media never paid the attention to communities. We treat everybody as a mass
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.920]   We treat them. We're the same we give no respect to tons of communities in this country
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:26.520]   And this guy comes along and actually wants book communities together and you have to mock him
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:33.400]   Look at the mirror first fella look at the mirror good point beat. Yeah media have not respected communities
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:40.440]   Mark Zuckerberg respects communities a hell of a lot more than we do in media. Thank you for that commercial interrupt. Yeah, no, that's a good point
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.720]   That's a good point
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.200]   Uh, I still wonder why he's doing 30 states barnstorming
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.040]   And and meeting with people if he's not running for president
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:57.480]   Because I think he's probably getting out of the bubble. It's marketing. Yeah. All right. That's fair
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.200]   He wants to sell to people in all those places. He knows no they understand what they need what they want
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:07.640]   Yeah, but the truth is I'll be honest. All he really needs to do is let the algorithm do its work. It's doing great
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:13.080]   You know, they've got all the signals about what people want and then just keep you know feeding it back in a feedback loop
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.440]   And the news fee just gets better and better and better from that point of view
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:20.200]   Do you think he really has to care about anything else? All he has to do is make sure the
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.920]   It's because there's a next there's a next phase of facebook
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:29.160]   That if he moves well because the first phase was friend or friend only then you know friend to college then town and
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:33.640]   Virens now he says it's community and the polis in society
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.280]   And so I think you've got a fundamentally rethink
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.600]   Parts of what facebook does it is tuned now to give you just your friends
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.560]   Um, and if it's really gonna I don't think it is I think I disagree with you
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:51.880]   I think it's it's I think everybody's facebook feed is unique because it's tuned to give you more of what you engage with isn't it?
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.480]   Yeah, but it tends to be a lot of my friends. I see a lot of you
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.240]   I see no
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.120]   Because you have no I have a jeff javis feed on my facebook
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:06.040]   But but but the thing is I think no two feeds will probably look alike because they don't yeah, that's what he said to be long
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.120]   No two people are the same facebook. Yeah, but I think there is something understanding what communities do together
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.000]   What they how they talk together that's different from what facebook is now
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.480]   And and I think you've got to get out and talk to people understand how they live among other people
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:25.800]   To have a better sense of how you can serve that don't forget that that it's that line that that he said in front of me
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.200]   Many years ago that I've quoted on the show that I love so much
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:34.040]   That when a certain publisher of a major newspaper in the u.s. Begton. How do we make communities? How do we create communities?
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.240]   So i can work said you don't make communities they already exist
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:43.160]   You should ask them how to help them do what they already do better and his prescription for that was that you bring them his quote
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.240]   Elegant organization
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.760]   So he knew how harvard operated he knew how that community operated he knew what people wanted to get dates, shall we say?
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:56.280]   Um, and he created a structure around that that was that was a contained world and and relatively simple
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.320]   Now it's so complex that I think he does need to get out and be inspired by
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:08.760]   Getting among people and you know, we we yell about the filter bubble of silicon valley and he gets out and we mock him for it
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:15.400]   All right, i'm going to give you the benefit of that and i'm going to give mark the better for that that
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:23.160]   I know another snobby media piece. I guess it is. Yeah, I mean, I that's a little unfair of me
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.360]   He went to did you read it stacy jim just was long
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.680]   Um, so I didn't mean to make you point that out. I'm sorry
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:38.200]   Um, but he basically analyzes everything that zucker burger said with the word community since you know his birth
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.000]   and
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.600]   I don't know that it needs that kind of criminology. I think that's he's more apparent. He's not as mysterious as he seems
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.680]   This is I think community is important. I want to have better tools to help communities connect
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.560]   That's what he's doing. I
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.280]   You know, I might believe that except it feels like facebook
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.760]   When faced with this issue of whether
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.920]   Russians were using facebook to manipulate the electorate last year
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:09.800]   Uh facebook denied it and denied it and denied it and denied it and denied it and denied it for more than a year than finally admitted it
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:14.040]   Makes me think that they're me. I mean, you think that that they really genuinely
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.840]   Didn't know it was happening until they did
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.280]   Yeah
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.120]   Yeah, because it's the same thing with al franking
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.520]   Before uh questioning google
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:30.120]   Uh and facebook rubles about the rubles because they weren't looking for that signal
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:37.720]   There's vast system with billions of ads. They had no reason to go looking for rubles and political ads until once it was pointed out
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.200]   Oh crap. Yeah, all right
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.160]   But
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.360]   I would submit that we have to keep a really eagle eye on them that they have to there is a because of the fat the power that facebook
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.480]   could google
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.640]   And and others wield amazon
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:59.480]   They they need extra scrutiny and they i mean the standards have to be very high for them
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:06.520]   Right and the way that that occurs in my view is that is that we is that they should be smart enough and they're not yet
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:12.200]   To get ahead of all this and to set standards and principles that go beyond current expectations
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:19.560]   And be key in those standards and stacy's talked about this a lot is the transparency because only with transparency can we keep up on this?
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.400]   Let's go to a different story
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.040]   The fact that you can target and add to not
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:29.240]   African-Americans, right that's abhorrent and awful right, but I can also see why
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:33.000]   Somebody black lives matter about come along and say I want to target this message to
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.560]   People of a race then anything that can be used will get misused
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:44.200]   The way the platform is this case is to say here's a very easy neon way if you see something missing using this tool
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.880]   Tell us immediately and we're gonna have staff. We're gonna get on it. How would you know?
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   These are dark ads so basically
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.760]   Propuglica discovered they were doing it facebook said we'll stop and then they pro publica tested it again
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.400]   The way they were doing it they would buy ads
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:02.520]   But they would say I don't want any african-americans to see this actually they had a really kind of funny
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.360]   List of the kinds of people that they may or may not want to see it and they were able to buy those ads
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.440]   So it's not redlining exactly
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.520]   But it's kind of using facebook's tools to target advertising
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.200]   So one way to deal with that is to make every single ad on facebook transparent
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:23.720]   Right every ad in a newspaper is so far. They've only talked about doing it with political ads right little ads
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:30.440]   I think I think if you really want to think this through you say let's make every ad transparent and all is targeting criteria transparent good
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.880]   and uh and and put an api to them
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.120]   And then the public can help you keep them honest but because inevitably
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.720]   Someone's gonna come along and they're gonna game the system. They're gonna do something awful
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.960]   Facebook does not watch for the rubles until they know they need to watch for rubles
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.200]   They need help to do that
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.720]   If they were a transparent in the first place and b had very easy mechanisms to people report and then c
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.920]   They actually acted on that it's kind of interesting though. I mean, I I've heard of ad targeting
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:03.560]   Uh, you know when people buy ads on twitter, they're targeting a group. This is kind of unchargeting
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.400]   I've never heard of negative targeting so
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.760]   Pro publica said we don't want ads to be shown to certain categories like african-americans
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.080]   But also mothers of high school kids people interested in wheelchair ramps
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.200]   We don't want the ad to be shown to people interested in wheelchair ramps
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:23.240]   We don't want the ad to be showed to jews to expats from argentina to spanish speakers
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.400]   You can see how that would be used to discriminate
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:30.120]   I'm so surprised facebook has that tool. No, stop for a second, right?
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.840]   People interested in wheelchair ramps. Do you want to advertise to them?
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:41.720]   Yes, right. I want to sell a wheelchair. I want to sell a better wheelchair ramp. That's a perfectly logical okay
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.680]   But I understand why you would have a tool that says not to sell to them
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.960]   Okay, let's say you want to sell skateboards to people and you don't want to waste your money
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:51.160]   You don't want to put people who have wheelchair ramps or you know some better example of that
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.320]   I think you're as an advertiser you're more likely
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:57.640]   Or exclude all you have to do is say I want people who would be likely to buy skateboards
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.280]   I mean really is there I don't know maybe I don't know. Yeah, oh no
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:05.720]   So so I want to get I want to advertise to this product to women
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:11.880]   Um, but not married women, right? So please make sure to exclude women who have babies
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:17.480]   I don't know. I can't come up with a good example. I can't so there are some conceivable reasons why you want a solution
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.040]   Get this used yeah, and so if you have anything where they possibly related to race
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:26.520]   Somebody in the company a chief risk officer has to stop and say whoa
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:29.880]   Let's make sure we limit how this can be used
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:33.080]   Uh, and maybe they are messed up. I don't know what they did
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:38.920]   But there's there's legitimate reasons to target and not target groups. You know people expense from Argentina
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:44.280]   There's something fundamentally wrong with that. I may want to sell them tickets on right avianca
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:50.600]   Yeah, so you know and and this is the problem with something operating at this kind of scale with automated systems
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:54.840]   You're gonna all sorts of things like this are gonna happen all you can say it's become more catch them and
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:31:01.080]   We just all about that the real issue is the pro public that this issue was raised before and facebook said they would fix it and they still have it I guess
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.160]   Yes, that's the issue. Yeah
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:08.600]   Uh, twitter is testing a tweet storm feature. Oh joy
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:14.920]   Um black friday are you all gonna stay see I know you getting live
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.120]   3 a.m at your local uh walmart store to get some of those doorbusters specials, right?
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.800]   You know last year. I actually did go to target. Did you thanks giving evening? Uh, we wanted to pick up a
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:32.760]   Uh nintendo ds, maybe it was the year before that. Oh, oh you had to did you succeed?
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.360]   We did we um, it was it was touch and go but we did
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   We did not find anybody. I would I am not ready to fist a cuff. Well now you gotta get the nintendo switch forget the ds
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   We have that oh good
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.720]   I'm sure your daughter lives on that that thing is super fun
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:57.080]   We just bought rhyme on it and I'm I'm sad to see that that game is not as good on the switch as it is on the ps4
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:02.520]   So zalda was great and mario was great mario kart or whatever it was was great
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:06.440]   Oh, well, I won't be I rhyme then
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:15.240]   It's a it's a beautiful game. I'm very so familiar. Um, are i me or are h ym. All right. I am e
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.240]   I
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:21.960]   You're a young boy who is waking waking up in a woken up in a mysterious island
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.480]   Wood is pretty or it's so pretty
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.960]   Uh, i'll stand steam i'll have to get this on steam
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:34.040]   I I'm really excited by games like this that are not kind of the traditional, you know shoot them up
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.920]   yeah, well, that's
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:42.520]   There have always been games like this they're just not they're not huge sellers
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:46.760]   They were they were pc games. I mean remember like oh, yeah
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.120]   And seven love I mean like all those games
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:55.720]   Yeah, but the world is dominated now by the call of duties and you know grand theft autos of the world
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.800]   This is looks a little bit like selda
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:03.800]   Yeah, it's it's a story game and what's nice is there's all kinds of other things. I think is
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:11.560]   As people realize that there's a huge market for games that isn't shoot them ups
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.880]   Right there. I mean I hope
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:18.440]   You know call of duty world war two the new version sold half a billion
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:24.520]   Dollars worth of units in three days. Yeah, so if you're a game developer
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:29.080]   You're looking at that going of course cuphead went platinum in a couple of weeks
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.960]   Still shooting but at least it's a little different something a little different
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:37.320]   I don't know. I think that's the problem is people want to make hits. It's like movies
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.200]   Well, I mean, I'm not gonna. I mean if I wrote a book. I'd want it to be a bestseller
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.200]   But you wouldn't but you wouldn't write it to be a bestseller
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.640]   No, because that would be a very good thing with love story
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.840]   Oh
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:59.240]   That's an old story. He uh, he said I am going to he was a I think I was he a harvard professor. He said I'm gonna write a bestseller
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.880]   And he wrote a 1970 bestseller that was
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.760]   As big as it can get
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:12.920]   While I'll train a neural note to do it now now you could do that. Mm-hmm. Love story love story
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.080]   Jenny we're probably very
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.040]   Nothing do you know love story
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:26.600]   No, oh my god. I wasn't bored in 1970. Where do I begin?
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.400]   Tell the story of
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:34.760]   Is the tearjerker of all tearjurs. Yes. Yeah, like beaches worse
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:38.040]   Wow, oh, you should watch love story. You'd like it
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.280]   Really? Actually don't watch the movie read the book. It's a better book. It's a good book
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.480]   It's actually a wonderful book. Yeah
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:52.120]   It's a it's a love story with it. It's a sappy love story, but it's not a happy love story
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:59.320]   Are you all gonna buy a new tesla truck? I would like to imagine arriving a work in this
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:08.920]   I don't think it makes that noise too. No, it doesn't affect. I called it. I called it a tesla diesel on another show and
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.480]   John said
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.480]   Not a diesel
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.880]   Let me explain to you how this test thing works. You know
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.960]   Diesel
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.840]   I think of diesel as a synonym for big truck
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.320]   It's not weird though. It only has a one seat
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.120]   You can't have you can't know hitchhikers
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.000]   And unless they go in the sleeping compartment
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.040]   500 mile range
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.200]   There is a frunk
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.480]   That's where the hitchhiker goes
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.560]   in the frunk
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:46.520]   It it also held interestingly a tesla roaster an updated roaster
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.280]   That goes from 0 to 100 kilometers an hour in
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.000]   1.9 seconds
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.400]   That'll that'll pin your head to the back of the seat
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:01.720]   You know already ludicrous mode hurts. I can't do it. I have it saying you have ludicrous
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:08.120]   No, or is it ridiculous whatever they're high inside a friend of mine has it and I was like get too much
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.360]   I can't I I'm I'm gonna black
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.040]   I'm gonna write I start to read out when I do it
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.120]   So I just I don't dare do it because I know I'll go unconscious and drive into a wall
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:22.040]   So yeah, I don't definitely don't need anything more more than just average acceleration
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:28.600]   Well, I think 0 to 60 is about the same as 0 to 100 kilometers per hour. I think it's pretty close
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.680]   That's why I said that I think they quote for some reason 0 to 100
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:39.160]   Maybe that's the European story I was reading and the roaster and actually I don't know why maybe I've got teslamania
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.040]   But I decided to put a model three deposit down
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.760]   Oh, I have a while
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.080]   So mines come in both of you
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.280]   Well, I put mine down way back in the day of craziness
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.600]   So if you do it today, it's 12 to 18 months and I'm hoping it's going to be 18 months more than 12
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.000]   Well, you know what if you want mine
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.880]   We're we're kind of debating. Do we want the three or not? We're about to have to make a decision today because I feel like
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.880]   They're not putting the seats in yeah, I feel like they're kind of
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:13.160]   They still have some issues to work out. Yeah, that's kind of our thought. Yeah
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.880]   But on the other hand, I think a year and a half from now it might be all right
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:25.080]   You're a very optimistic man Leo. That's the that's the uh, I'll tell you why
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.800]   I'm seeing through this. No, I'm despairing. Didn't you get the despair? You missed the despair?
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.160]   I didn't despair, but you you default to optimism. I do I do fall to optimism. That's why when I despair it's so despairing
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.800]   So bad
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:45.000]   Uh, no, I'm uh reason is because my I only leased the model x so in uh a year and a half about 18 months
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.200]   Uh, I have to give it back. I thought maybe I'll trade it in for model three by then
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.440]   Maybe it'll be done. Well, the model x had its problems too. Yes
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.560]   It did. Yes
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.720]   But I I I'm uh, I'm all in on electric
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.600]   I'm all in on electric and once you drive a tesla, it's really hard to go to like a previous
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.120]   A boulder either of you uh been on a trip where you've had to stop
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:12.840]   Uh at a charging station or you always use it locally enough that you don't have to superchargers are great
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.720]   The superchargers are nice and I got one the one
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.840]   I'm sorry if you go on to a trip longer than your range. Yes
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   And how long do you hang out?
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.600]   Um about 25 20 minutes half an hour. Yeah
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.960]   There's a the supercharger because we drive to houston a lot
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.440]   There's a supercharger in columbus that is next to a amexican food place. So we'll stop
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.160]   Oh case so and electricity
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.560]   Ooh
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.560]   Cheese and juice
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:48.920]   I uh, we're gonna have a nissan leaf the 20 the new nissan leaf which comes out in the united states in january on the new
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.880]   Green savers in a couple of weeks. They're coming up and we're gonna take a test drive. That's their all electric car
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.760]   That home wants the range like on that. It's like uh, it's under 100 miles. It's not really
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:04.040]   Uh, but that's the best was the best selling electric car. I think uh last year
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.360]   If I could afford to own another car, I would love it for daily commuting
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:14.920]   But electric's nice. You just feel good about it. Of course electricity is very expensive in california, but that's why we got the solar panels
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:22.120]   electricity in austin super expensive. Yeah, 16 cents per kilowatt hour 18
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.080]   whoo
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:31.960]   Whoo, okay, you win. I win. No idea. Not a but not a game. I wanted to win you win for losing
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:37.880]   Uh kaspersky says yeah, well, we got an essay secrets, but we didn't steal them
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.960]   Uh
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.240]   Yeah
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:51.000]   I was still not run kaspersky antivirus if I were you I wouldn't run any antivirus, but I definitely wouldn't run kaspersky
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.600]   They said well. Yeah, it's part of how the antivirus works that it exfiltrated the nsa
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:03.320]   Uh virus is a 45 megabyte zip archive that contains source code malicious execution
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:07.560]   Executables and four documents bearing us government classification
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.880]   markings
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.440]   So the when it got to kaspersky because that's what it naturally, you know automatically happens
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.880]   They quarantine it and send it off to the main main office in russia
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:24.440]   For analysis the company analyst who manually reviewed it quickly determined it contained confidential material
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:27.800]   Within a few days
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:33.160]   and at the direction of the founder Eugene kaspersky the company deleted all the materials except for the malicious binaries
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:38.440]   And then they created a special software tweak to prevent it from being downloaded again
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.560]   Yeah, problem with all of this is you know, you don't know who to believe
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:50.760]   I don't I don't know who to believe why take a chance. Yeah, but don't be may I go back to another story? Yes, you may
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.840]   so uh back into what you said stacey so tim woo
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:59.880]   In fact over the phrase net neutrality has a piece in the time saying blame tim for this whole thing
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.920]   Yeah, why the courts will have to save net neutrality
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:10.200]   And in it he says not only have as free presses demonstrated investment has gone up since these rules have been in place
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:17.160]   But he says and I quote mr. Pi faces a more serious legal problem because he is killing net neutrality outright not merely
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.520]   Weaking it weakening it he will have to explain to a court najas the shift from 2015
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:28.440]   But also his reasoning for destroying the basic bans on blocking and throttling which have been in effect since 2005
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.800]   And have been relied on extensively by the entire internet ecosystem. This will be a difficult task
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.760]   I hope so. Yes. I hope so too
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.960]   I mean there is a reason
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:45.640]   That a republican commissioner that later became a lobbyist
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:49.800]   enshrined the anti blocking and discrimination
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.520]   Clauses as the four pillars of open internet access. Oh internet
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.200]   Michael Powell 20 2005. I used to have these memorized, but no, I don't
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:07.160]   Used to be a thing. I didn't think of you to begin right stacey. There was a shrine. That was it
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:14.440]   It was over and I stopped covering net neutrality. I celebrated so hard and then I couldn't stop. I couldn't look away
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.600]   I'll take another queso, please
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.600]   No net neutrality
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.240]   Let's take a break come back
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.280]   Uh, we got to get to queso. It's soon to be queso time
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.480]   What was it you said?
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:31.880]   Juice and cheese juice and cheese and juice cheese and juice time
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.680]   coming up
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.240]   Just a little bit our show today brought to you by video blocks from story blocks
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.640]   If you do video production, you know that you got to have pictures to match the words
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.960]   You got to have vivid imagery, but if you have to shoot it all that could blow the budget out
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:52.520]   If you have to buy it from some of these other services that could blow the budget out
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:58.040]   But video blocks by story blocks gives you sound effects for podcast production video backgrounds

[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.040]   Justice department wants to block
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.600]   So strange
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.600]   18 t-time Warner merger
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.560]   That's what trump said he would do when he was a candidate
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:35.160]   But then you I don't know for a while. I kind of thought oh, there's no no bad mergers
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.760]   Now the allegation is maybe it has something to do with the fact that time Warner owns CNN
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:44.280]   And we know that mr. Trump is not a fan
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:49.240]   It's an $85 billion deal
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:56.520]   The first thing I would say no and that's uh, let's uh, let's ban autoplay video. How about yeah
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.480]   How about when does that when does chrome stop those?
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:05.960]   I'm now on firefox. I should go back to chrome. This is firefox quantum the new firefox 57 is great
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.520]   I really like it. Although we'll and we'll talk about in a second some numbers from mashable. Let's say it's
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.240]   Still not as fast as chrome
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.200]   Uh, so uh, let's let's ask our political analyst jeff jervis
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.080]   Who appears regularly on cnn
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:26.280]   Uh, what do you what do you think is this? Uh, is this trump's revenge or yeah?
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.600]   Yeah, i'm appalled because there's no consistency to this
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.000]   First off as everyone points out. It's a vertical merger not a horizontal merger. There is no
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]   uh major
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.600]   uh consumer impact where there is consumer impact they'd be in a better stronger position to negotiate that and negotiate
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.680]   Structures on their behavior as they did with comcast and bc universal
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:50.200]   Uh, you can certainly argue it's too big but the way the law is set up now just as comcast mbc universal to go through
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.440]   So should encode this
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.760]   Uh, and then and then third is
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:58.440]   That as i said earlier
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.600]   That they are about to let through
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:03.320]   uh, sin claire and tribute
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:09.880]   And as way way too big and sin claire pretty scary. I saw the ceo of sin claire and he's kind of a creepy guy
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:14.280]   And uh at an event slink sink like carried water for the trump
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.880]   Campaign all through the election season by requiring their local channel their local news
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.040]   Uh to carry
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:28.040]   special press release effectively press release stories in favor of the trump campaign. Yeah, yeah
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:36.120]   And uh, then you also have the fcc's about to take down the limitations as i said earlier of ownership rules
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.840]   So so big is fine
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.960]   With everything except oh you own cnm. Yeah, and it's it's it's a it's a it's a cloke to say
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:49.880]   They have to sell either a cnn or direct tv. It's the government trying to hamper the merger such that it doesn't happen
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:55.560]   Just out of spite now the interesting thing here is that just today there was a case around
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:56.840]   um
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:03.560]   Transsexuals in the military where trump's own tweets entered into the case as they have in the muslim band
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:10.120]   Yeah, he he's forgetting that he that tweeting is material and yes can be used to
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:17.160]   Discover intent and the courts are very happy to do that. Yeah. Yeah, so i think it'll come back in here, but it's just
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:24.920]   Yeah, where do you turn your attention? Where do you turn to despair? Where do you you know, it's it's just uh and further evidence to support your case?
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.920]   Uh, the doj has reached out to 18 state attorneys general
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:33.080]   Asking them to join the deal and none of them have agreed to do so so yeah
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:40.200]   While in the philippines i was forged to watch cnn which i have not done in months and again i realized how bad and fake it is
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:42.760]   loser
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:50.120]   Well the worst of it is probably the him retweeting that him him being up the cnn and the logo
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.160]   He retweeted that he tweeted it again
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:58.040]   After all the heat he got the first time. Oh, no, this is back in the first time. Yeah, yeah
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.240]   um
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:05.800]   Fcc votes to abandon rural and low-income americans
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.720]   That was that was in my tweet. Here's my tweet. I'm gonna find it because somewhat so here it is
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.200]   encapsulating all the despair
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:21.800]   This fcc is going to destroy net neutrality strinkle competition in media let wireline providers off the hook for replacing copper with a fiber or equivalent to copper
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:27.080]   And kill broadband access for the poor. This is an unprecedented attack on consumers
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:33.240]   Miss hickenbotham that is the first good use i've heard of 280 characters. Yeah nice and long i
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:39.400]   Needed i needed all of them to get that all in there is what is the so why do you think they're why would they do this?
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:45.640]   Given that it is obviously politically going to be challenging to abandon low-income americans
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.600]   What why would why would agitpie do this?
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:55.320]   Well lifeline has been life there. It's no secret lifeline first thing he did when he got into office first thing he did was
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.880]   stopped the lifeline payments
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.400]   well
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.160]   It has been a boondoggle like there if you want to look at
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:06.360]   scandals for the scc you can look at how much
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.040]   Carriers have gotten from lifeline big ones small ones
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.440]   um the abuse of lifeline is rampant so
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.600]   Yeah
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:19.000]   There's always been talk of getting rid of it
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.560]   um usually
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:28.920]   Reforming it is the the issue or replacing it with something more suited to the times because lifeline originally only
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.960]   was telephone and then we had to fix it to
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:35.240]   offer broadband and
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:37.000]   You know
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.880]   Democratic FCC commissioner minion kleibern who i like a lot says the fcc continues to push it's a carrier first agenda
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:49.000]   One of the things this allows carriers to do is discontinue phone service to uh rural
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.840]   users who don't make them any money in the past they've been required to offer something in in return
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:59.640]   But the the now it's hey you got wire you got we got cellular. What do you what do you want?
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.200]   And that's what this is um
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:07.240]   That's the same reason that they're talking about the copper equivalency and getting rid of that
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.520]   It's because
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:14.760]   It's expensive to push infrastructure out to the middle of the country where they're like five people and you have to you know
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.880]   This is
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.560]   It goes back to the depression when we had a rural electrification program
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.280]   uh
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:25.320]   if once you once you say well electricity is
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.920]   Is important or telephone service is important to everybody
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:34.440]   The only people that are going to make that happen is the government is going to push carriers to do it or subsidize it themselves
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:39.240]   uh, it's in the national interest and uh, it's to abandon
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.320]   rural users
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.160]   and low-income users because
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:48.040]   Well, it's not very profitable is just that's not what government is supposed to do
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.520]   So i'm doing this
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.800]   Go ahead. Sorry
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.640]   Go ahead. No, you go ahead
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:58.280]   I was going to say we have been doing this since probably the 80s or early 90s
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:02.760]   We have decided that government does nothing useful. There has been a constant
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.440]   Right
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.200]   Debasement of what the government does and provides so it makes
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.840]   sense that we would say
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:14.440]   No to this and we have been leaving behind our most vulnerable
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.920]   For decades
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.000]   This is what is it? It's just coming to a head
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.280]   Is it right all you breaking used to say the scariest words in the english language are i'm from the government and i'm here to help
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.480]   Well, so to your points, dacey
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:31.880]   I I plugged this book last week and i'm still listening to it and it's just wonderful
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:37.880]   um, uh, americana 400 year history of american capitalism by brew, uh, boo
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.720]   treaty vassen
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.400]   uh, an entrepreneur who
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.400]   Delvis it's just it's just wonderful
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.320]   Uh, and I was just listening today to I didn't realize that it was john. Wanna maker
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:49.880]   uh, who
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:55.480]   Built one of the early department stores changing retail entirely. Yeah, who was yes who was
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:01.480]   Postmaster general and he was the architect of world free delivery. Oh my goodness
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:07.480]   Yeah, and and and and the point that true to vassen makes is before this government actually did very few things
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.800]   Which of course is a world that certain people want to return to
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.040]   Um, one of the things it did was postal service and people were left out
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:20.440]   People in remote farms without cars before their work cars had to go long distances to get mail and they were cut off
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:25.880]   And and so rfd was a major equalizer in the country. All right, so we did that with
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.240]   Visual institute robot catalog enabled seers
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.520]   Exactly, we wouldn't have amazon if it weren't for rfd
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:35.560]   By the way other he also this is the retail chapter
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:41.880]   So we talked about the Montgomery ward came first then seers and it sounds so much like amazon because what they both did was they offered free
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.960]   Returns right so that you were safe to order it was safe
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:51.320]   And it killed the local stores and did all kinds of things so so Stacy you're right you start with rfd
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.040]   Then you go to world electrification then you go to the
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:58.440]   uh fees added under our phones to assure phone service and
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.360]   internet is vital
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.840]   Uh, and we cut it all out. What's this book called? I want to get it. It's really good
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.440]   Americana a 400 year history of american capitalism
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:12.360]   All right by bu Schrinivas and it is on audible
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.920]   Is on audible and it's you
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920]   It's excellent. He reads the
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:17.960]   the
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:24.840]   Intro that one scotter is great. I love scotter. All right. That's it's really really well done really fascinating. I'm put it on my list right now
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:28.200]   I'm on by credits to use a month
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:33.000]   I get I have two months and I use them even if I don't read the books. I got them in my library
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.040]   I figure i'm gonna retire and i'm just listen to books all day
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:42.280]   I buy extras do the do the do the credits expire? Yeah, well depends on your plan. I think they I think they can yeah
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:47.000]   I am just not an audible like I don't like listening to books. Yeah, it's something
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.080]   It's a some people do. I didn't either Stacy. I made fun in fact, you know what? I made fun of it
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:56.360]   That's not really reading. I know people used to say that one. I wouldn't make fun of it. I just I'm like oh, I did
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.720]   I can't do it
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:58.680]   um
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.680]   Well, of course I've got a long commute
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:05.640]   And uh, I've read and I've got to do and I've got the freaking internet thing and all that
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:08.680]   It's it's it's books that I don't want to have to underline
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:12.200]   So it's either fiction or fascinating books like this
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.120]   and um
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:18.120]   It fills the hours and it takes me away from the news sometimes which I need
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:25.080]   Yeah, last night. I couldn't watch another bit of news. I went to bed put on my I put my earbuds in and I listened to uh
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:26.840]   A book
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.160]   Till I fall asleep was very nice. So you're there so well Leo the problem with that is then you don't know where you left
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:33.240]   Off. Yeah, I know
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:37.160]   That had worked very well. Yeah, well, yeah, I got it back up a little bit. That's all right
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:44.120]   Did you read the daily beast piece? Have you first of all if you played hq the trivia game, Lisa and I like to play this never won
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.000]   crazy game last night
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]   112,000 people
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.960]   Were online. It actually cray crashed the servers. They had to start half an hour late
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:59.480]   Uh, and the idea is they have big potjack pots. This was a thousand dollar jackpot last night
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:05.080]   You get 12 questions if you answer them all correctly you get a share of the jackpot and last night. I think uh five
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.720]   What was it no nine people?
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:10.760]   Uh got it right. So each 111 bucks
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:14.280]   Not bad for playing a twa and it's fun. It's trivia
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:18.920]   Uh, but part of the reason for its success because it's I mean we've seen this a million times
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:24.920]   You don't know jack. I can go on and on and lots of games like is uh scott ragowski. He is the host
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.600]   Uh
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.160]   Former comic he was actually about ready to throw it in
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:32.120]   Uh again move away from new york
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:37.720]   He's trying to make his career when he got this call to do this and now he's such a big star on the hq
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.240]   App when he's not there occasionally. He's not there
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.400]   All the chances were scott bring me a scott. We missed scott. Well apparently um because of this
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:50.360]   The daily beast wanted to interview him
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.440]   So
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.640]   So they called him up. They interviewed him. They didn't talk about hq particularly that talked about his daily life
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:01.320]   He's a cult figure now and how he can't walk down the street without people
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.440]   You know
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.440]   Asking for selfies and and stuff one fan recently tweeted everyone needs 15 minutes of scott in their lives
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.640]   Another if you don't like scott from hq. We can't be friends
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:18.280]   So uh, they wrote it. Uh what they call a light-hearted profile on his career. He agreed to do the interview
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.720]   uh daily beast also reached out to uh
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:28.200]   hq's pr and rus usapov he was one of the founders of vine who founded hq letting him know
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:34.840]   They wanted to do a story about ragowski several hours later. We received an email from usapov saying hq is not making scott available
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.000]   Discusses involvement with hq in the media and the press
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:44.440]   The reporter informed usapov. We'd already interviewed scott and story was nearing publication, but call us with concerns then they let him read the story
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:50.680]   Usapov said it's complete you're completely unauthorized to write this story. I am gonna fire scott if you publish it
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.160]   You're putting scott's job in jeopardy is that what you want scott could lose his job
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:59.480]   Uh
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.880]   Among other things that usapov objected to as the line scott said that despite the attention
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:08.120]   He's still able to walk down the street and order his favorite salad from sweet green without being accosted
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:14.280]   He cannot say that usapov shouted. We do not have a brand deal with sweet green under no circumstances can he say that
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:20.600]   When asked to confirm that ragowski can't say he personally enjoys eating at sweet green
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.160]   Usapov said he cannot say that
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.640]   Now
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.080]   on the one hand
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:33.240]   Uh, if you worked at apple you couldn't and i we look at we try to get people from google all the time and they have to ask pr and pr says no
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.280]   So on the one hand, I think it is the company's right to say i but the well of course they one of the things
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:43.800]   Uh, they learned the daily beast learned is that scott is not an employee, but a contract employee
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.760]   Oh, well then they can't do anything. They can't really stop him
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.720]   I'm doing that they can fire him
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:52.680]   But they could fire him you could fire him for anything right?
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:56.600]   Uh, you could fire him for nothing you could fire him from nothing
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:01.240]   It's called at will employment at will uh, so
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:05.320]   usapov then
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.920]   A day later, uh when the daily beast called
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:14.760]   Letting him know that the story is going to be reframed around his comments. We're going to talk about what you just said russ
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:19.960]   Uh usapov brought ragowski out of the phone call and falsely claimed i never threatened to fire him
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.440]   Um
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:28.520]   Poor scott. I have to feel bad. I don't want to fire scott scott's our guys is ragowski. So
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:31.400]   I know none of this means anything, but
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:34.200]   From journalistically though
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.280]   Who was in the right?
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.440]   Well, why did the reporter read the quote to the dude?
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:43.480]   About sweet greens. Yeah, he said we normally we don't uh, we don't we refuse to do that
[01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:48.040]   But in this case he was so upset we gave him the whole we emailed him the article
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.520]   Which is that's that's done
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:56.920]   You never did that but in you know what's facing in in germany when I get interviewed they they read the close to you
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:59:02.040]   That happens to me from time to time for a fact. That's kind of a form of fact checking. Yeah
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:09.960]   I'm did I get this right? Yeah, but but still you don't you would read it back to the person that you've said it to not to their ceo
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:17.640]   Yes, but from a journalistic point of view. It's okay. I mean that's not your issue that might be an employer employee issue
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:23.560]   But if somebody from google agreed to let me interview them. That's not my responsibility to make sure that he's okay
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:27.720]   The oh yeah, that happens to me all the time. I mean I get people telling me stuff all the time. They're like oh man
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:34.200]   I shouldn't have said that. I'm like, I'm sorry. Have you ever had anybody threaten to fire an employee if you ran the story?
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:39.080]   No, although if you work at apple and you leak to the press
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:41.880]   You do run the risk of losing your job. Oh
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:45.880]   Not that scott leaked anything. I don't know if there's anything to leak
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.440]   It's a trivia game online
[01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:56.120]   It's some point just think people about how this makes you look or yeah, I mean I feel bad for scott rigowski the host
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:59.720]   Although he's probably in the capbridge seat here and and and
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:04.520]   Rest did not acquit himself well in this. I'm sure he's feeling bad right now
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:10.920]   Guys
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920]   I know you get hungry
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920]   Well, not only that, I'm not just
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:21.640]   I know um, I'm sorry that I was not there. I'm looking through our stories. I thought oh dude. We want to talk about uber
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:24.440]   And oh my god uber. Oh
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:31.240]   So this really goes back to travis calonex watch last october uber discovered there was a breach
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:36.520]   7 million drivers records including drivers licenses have been exfiltrated by bad guys
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:43.640]   And 50 million customer records not credit card numbers they say but names addresses and phone numbers
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:51.240]   uber on was the hackers ransomed it they contacted uber as I understand it although the stories seems to have changed a little bit but
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:57.160]   The latest I understand is the hackers contacted uber say for a hundred thousand dollars will bury this
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:00.760]   uber paid the money and then made the hackers sign an nda
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:03.560]   So I think I would never tell anybody it happened
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:06.520]   Uh, of course the new
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.560]   CEO over at uber. I think when he discovered this
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:12.600]   Decided to reveal it. This was something uber revealed
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:18.440]   Right. Yes. Well, yes. Dara Dara did explain that that was
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:23.000]   Something that he discovered and he's supposed to reveal data breaches
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.160]   Yeah, what is in europe that is the law now. What is the state in the us about data breaches and your obligation?
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:33.880]   I think you have to reveal them after a certain period of time if certain pia
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.040]   I'm pretty sure that's been the rules for at least a decade
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:41.160]   Let me let me ask google
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:46.600]   Yeah, I'm like, hmm. What is the us law regarding revealing data breaches?
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:49.320]   You're not gonna get an answer
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:58.200]   Okay, here we go 48 states the dc guan porter eco and the virgin islands have an acted regular or legislation requiring private or governmental
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:02.440]   Indities to notify individuals of security breaches of information involving pii
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:05.560]   Good and this would qualify as pii
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:08.120]   It says
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.320]   It most of the laws say who's responsible for doing it so
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.480]   Businesses data brokers government blah blah blah it defines pii
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:20.200]   And then it also says these will define individually what constitutes a breach
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:29.080]   And the timing and how people have to be noticed the deal was arranged by the company's chief security officer joe sullivan. He has been fired
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.480]   uh
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.480]   calonic knew about it
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.560]   And uh and good good on dara for revealing it
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.520]   I
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.880]   Mean that's kind of like the bare middle, but I mean this poor guy. I'm coming in
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.720]   It's like it's like you're walking into a
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:53.160]   Truck stop bathroom and you just know you're responsible for cleaning up
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:58.680]   I don't think that's true. Is that true? No. No, you just leave
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.840]   You know, well, but he's he's a guy who said he's going to
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.400]   Read the calendar. Yeah, no, you're
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:11.400]   I mean, but he took the job knowing that it was when he walked into that bathroom. Yeah, it's going to be not exciting
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.760]   Coast road Shah. He said none of this should have happened. I will not make excuses for it while I can't erase the past
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.000]   I can't commit on behalf of every uber employee
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.800]   We will learn from our mistakes were changing the way we do business putting integrity at the core of every decision we make
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:27.560]   And working hard to earn the trust of our customers. I think that that's genuine
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.560]   Uh, I've heard from many people that the dara is a good person
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:37.880]   And there's no reason not to believe that uber wants to turn over new leaf, but this is uh, this is old history
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:39.960]   They're gonna and i'm glad you know what?
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.600]   Props to him for revealing it
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:47.800]   I don't think he had to once you once you know it you got it. Well. Yep, except that
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:51.880]   Those other guys didn't Sullivan didn't calonic didn't
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:59.160]   Do you care that uh that uh, your every move at Thanksgiving will be tracked by a company called safe graph
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:08.280]   Uh, this is funny because I saw the story like crazy about how people are not going to have thanksgiving dinners with family members
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:11.560]   Who voted differently than they did and you know, there's big
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.120]   You know a lifestyle story and a lot of newspapers last week, but uh,
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:23.240]   props to the uh the uh outline and uh a dr. On jeff jefries who said well wait a minute
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.880]   How do they know that?
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:28.200]   And it turns out a company called safe graph
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:33.080]   Has 17 trillion location markers for 10 million
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:39.400]   Smartphones company companies who make wallpaper apps maps apps and the like
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   Uh, install the safe graph software. I'm sure safe graph pays them something
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:50.200]   Uh, and then reports back on their users locations for safe graph. So safe graph for instance
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:56.440]   Says well, we're going to identify your home is wherever you are between the most of the time between the hours of one and four
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:01.000]   And then they looked at where people were between one and five p one and four a.m
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.640]   Then they looked at where people were between one and five p.m
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:10.760]   On Thanksgiving day to see if they spent it at home or traveled and then they looked at who you were with and for thanksgiving
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:15.080]   And they were able to generate this this data
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:22.440]   They say it's fully anonymized, but how anonymized is going to be if they know your political affiliation and whether you're with family members
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:33.160]   Nothing to say, huh? What are you gonna do? So so um, see this I blame more than google
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:38.760]   Well, four square has this data. Yeah, I give four square willingly give them my data
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:43.960]   You related to them and and they sell it as data now and they get value out of it and they analyze it in new ways. Yeah
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:46.920]   All right, well, um
[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:50.040]   It all of these apps now. I mean for a while people
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:57.480]   That was a problem with these apps because you didn't have to give permissions like when you gave your permissions you were like, oh, I'm so when you're wallpapers like
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.960]   Can I use location tracking?
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:03.960]   No, they know
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:07.640]   There's the there's the moral and story. Yeah, that's exactly right. Just say no
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:13.960]   So what so so the paper did cite the online site in Germany simulated thanksgiving since they don't have it
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:20.200]   They asked people at the end of about five stories binary opinion questions like Germany already has enough refugees
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:23.640]   Germany has more refugees they then on one day in june
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.600]   at 12,000 people volunteer
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:30.440]   To meet someone near them who disagreed with them. Oh
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:36.360]   One on one sounds unpleasant. There was sort of 6,000. No, there was I asked were there any fisticuffs? They said no
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:41.160]   My favorite part of this was one woman was matched by the algorithm to her father-in-law
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:49.640]   Well, uh, I'm not gonna go into too much detail, but we will be having thanksgiving dinner with uh, some people of
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:55.640]   uh different different worldviews. Yes different worldviews me too. Yeah, that's that's life
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:07:00.600]   It's always it has always been that way. I grew up with long hair as a hippie
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:05.720]   Don't you think we had those conversations during the vietnam war? I watched all in the family
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:08.440]   They call me meathead
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:14.200]   There's a game. There's a game very popular game called player unknowns battlegrounds
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:20.120]   It's a they call it a battle royale game. You're dropped into a world with a hundred other people in the last man standing wins
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:26.360]   Uh all of that aside. It's apparently a very fun game there. They want to they want to release it in china
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:32.360]   So they've agreed to put socialist friendly messages in the game
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:38.040]   Is this this is the beginning of it? I think we're gonna see a lot more of this
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:43.160]   The localization will provide quote healthy positive cultural and value guidance
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.400]   I
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:54.760]   Socialist messages to sell it in china. Yeah, okay. Yeah, why not? Why you're shooting somebody at least to say uh, you know
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:58.360]   You know to forward with a great economy
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:04.600]   Everyone sells a little of their soul to do business in china. So, you know, that's a minor thing, right?
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.000]   well
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.520]   Meanwhile, we've got artificial intelligence that can hunt down missile sites
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:17.080]   Faster than a human much faster than a human a good use for AI. They don't too much
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:20.920]   No, this is ours. These are our guys looking for uh, missile
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:26.440]   They could be the other guys. Yeah, well, that's true. I'm sure the other guys have been doing the same thing. Yeah
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:33.960]   My uncle did this for the cia. This was his job for years for the cia is analyzing uh
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:36.920]   satellite photography
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.240]   I guess he'd be out of work now in ai to put them in a work
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:47.160]   You know what I need I know what I need to to to turn around this
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:51.800]   Culture of despair. I need a fine cup of blue bottle coffee
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:59.000]   Oh my goodness blue bottle time blue bottle is the best coffee you've ever had the days are getting shorter
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:06.600]   The weather's cooling off and nothing compliments an autumn day a crisp autumn day like a warm delicious cup of coffee
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.280]   Not just any coffee coffee so rich so flavorful so delicious
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.160]   You'll say where have you been all my life?
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:17.960]   I don't have you had blue bottle when you've been in san francisco jeff it is
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.320]   uniquely amazing good darn good
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:24.120]   It is it is so good that I actually
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:29.960]   So you subscribe well, I did subscribe, but I gave my neighbor some and she subscribed nice
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:35.720]   She was like this is delicious. It was like it is it is you wouldn't think I mean you would think coffee is coffee
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.280]   But if you've been drinking you ban all your life. Oh, baby. That's not coffee. Look at this is uh
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:44.680]   By the way, one of the things that makes blue bottle unique is when you subscribe and they have a
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:47.400]   Bimonthly subscription so you get coffee every other week
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:51.720]   When you subscribe they roast your beans within 48 hours of shipping
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:57.960]   So it's and it has the date right on it and I have to tell you fresh beans make a huge difference
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:59.800]   they source
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:01.000]   amazing
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.440]   both blends and
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.080]   Single farm coffees. I'm looking at the costa rica chirpo reguro darivas
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:14.360]   And they have a whole card in here about the family that raised the coffee and about the notes, you know the fudge or sweet
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:16.040]   ah
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:17.000]   sweet

[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:30.040]   No, this is this is the freshest most delicious
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:35.640]   Coffee they even have a decaf. I don't know why you drink it, but if you needed it the nightlight decaf is fabulous
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:39.880]   Oh, this is three africas is three different african beans
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:46.920]   Oh, you know you got to read the card says this coffee is the definition of homemade grown processed
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:52.760]   And even dry milled on the ureña family farm among the mango trees of riva
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:58.760]   Costa Rica years of tinkering have brought its sweetness into focus with a tart complexity that should please
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:07.160]   Its farm or the ambitious regalugarardo ruerena as much as it astonishes anyone with a good fortune to taste it
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.440]   Rainier cherry dried fig crembrelay
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:16.040]   I've got a giant steps actually. This is my favorite. I shouldn't admit to liking blends, but I love
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:19.320]   I don't know what they they have a coffee master really knows what they're doing
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:21.160]   um
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:23.240]   yugandrin yugandin and sumatran
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:25.160]   beans
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:31.720]   ultra balanced dense chocolatey cup that stands up to cream quite well, that's might be why because I drink I drink it with a
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:33.560]   with
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.640]   Sinful, but it's delicious heavy whipping cream
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:42.760]   If coffee were any heavier bodied you could pour it on pancakes viscous fudgy substantial. That's my being
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:46.120]   That's my brew. What's your brew go to blue bottle coffee.com

[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.960]   Oh where to go hold on
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:45.080]   Oh guys, did you take it down? No, no, okay. Have you been banned?
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.480]   So no, there's this there's it here. I'll pop it in copy paste
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.360]   Uh my my thing is a toy that I'm reviewing for my dog
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.680]   The clever pet
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:58.440]   Yes, you found it
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:01.880]   Okay, so that is the clever pet that's a toy
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.840]   It is a $300 y5 powered game for your dog
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:10.280]   And the goal is see those things that light up
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:15.880]   It's like simple simon. So the goal is eventually your dog will be trained to know touch those in order
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.960]   But if he does it right he gets a treat
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.440]   Right
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:22.520]   As your dog learned
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:28.600]   So my dog is still trying to figure out how the touch pads work. Yeah, why does it open sometimes mom?
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:33.800]   Yeah, if you turn the sound up you'll hear barking at it because she's just like ah
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.520]   What is this doing?
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:41.320]   Yeah, so there you go
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.920]   That's my daughter whispering. Yes, and then your daughter's gonna help the cheat
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:49.880]   That
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:51.880]   That noise goes on all day long
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.800]   Basically, it's a scanner box for your house
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:07.160]   So yes, that is that is the toy for your dog. I I wish it weren't so expensive and I wish I had a dog but uh other than that
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.240]   Great pet cat cats would just say a few oh yeah
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:13.160]   Although there are cat games
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:20.680]   We have played the little frisky's fishing game with the kitties and they will paw that iPad. Oh, yeah trying to catch those fish forever
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:27.960]   I have a video of it somewhere else. I'll find it with the brilliant google photos search to a wild jeff javis
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:31.080]   Gives us his numbers of the week
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.960]   Well, I was going to do the new hashtag
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:38.440]   2017 and four words, but then I looked up the most current entries and don't go there
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:41.320]   Oh dear, of course because of filthy right ruined
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.640]   uh, but my favorite was
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:46.920]   Um
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.920]   Uh vote
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:51.720]   I can't get the forwards vote next time. They basically
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:56.760]   I just like vote next time, but it's not that so nine ways twitter can punish you
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:58.840]   Really bad things
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:01.080]   Okay, right
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:05.800]   So uh, there's a list there and what I wonder is do they ever do this?
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.680]   Well, they they say that what they can they can yank your blue check. I know that
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:12.680]   Uh, they can
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:16.440]   They can reach the smaller audience. They can block you from tweeting
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.920]   They can hide your tweet from users in a specific country
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:23.160]   They can but if they can do all these things how come we still have so much abuse on twitter
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:27.320]   You know, I used to be with the mind the twitter should be open and everything goes and it's an open network
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.480]   but I'm now with the mind that they need to worry about the
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:34.120]   Sability of what occurs there and their responsibility and they got to figure out their own standards with that
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:35.560]   I know it's not easy
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.880]   But they let a lot of really bad crap go that's been reported
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.400]   So is it is it uh, it's not getting better
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:49.560]   I don't think so, but I don't know. Maybe that's maybe maybe I sound like right now like all the
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:55.560]   despairing internet users who say this is why he's falling apart, but but you know my I
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:58.200]   And I'm not trying to
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.760]   invite people to yell at me on twitter, but
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:05.560]   My twitter stream is a really nice place mine's been getting better now
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.480]   Maybe I've blocked muted and unfollowed the the bad apples
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:11.000]   Yeah, I know
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.040]   It was mean to me today was very nice. I had someone who told me that
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:17.880]   This is uh, what what what did they tell me?
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:20.120]   It was um
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:24.120]   They they didn't like something I wrote and they love our president donald trump
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.720]   So they are unsubscribing to my newsletter fair enough, but and I and I said okay because
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:35.080]   You know, but even that is like the the most negative thing that I think i've had
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:36.840]   Which
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:41.800]   I'm okay with uh you are very forced. Well, I see is people who report awful stuff
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.960]   And then show the response from twitter saying this doesn't violate our standards
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:49.560]   Right now and I have seen people talking about what they've
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:51.800]   You know
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:57.240]   And i'm not and i'm not denying that it's a bad place for other people and that it shouldn't be a bad place for people
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.080]   I'm just kind of like
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:00.920]   I don't know. I feel like
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:03.720]   I I like twitter my twitter has been
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:08.760]   You know and sometimes it's terrible, but last few months it's been quite pleasant. I agree
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:11.080]   Yeah
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:15.160]   And actually to that point i'm going to show you a little tool that i've been using a lot lately
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.360]   You may notice i have a lot of news stuff in my tweets i basically tweet out
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:20.360]   um
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.880]   You know any any of the new stories that we're thinking about this is from dave whiner the guy who i love dave
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:26.680]   He's kind of
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.400]   blogging
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:30.760]   He's a yeah invented blogging he's kind of a curmudgeon he also invented
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.520]   Outlining with think tank you may remember think tank going way
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:38.600]   Puckus and was a proto podcaster when adam kurry
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:43.240]   The podfather came to him and said you know dave he invented rss dave whiner did
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:48.440]   Daveyot include uh binary enclosures in those rss feeds like maybe an audiophile
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:53.160]   Dave did and invented thereby the medium which we are using right now
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.120]   He has a lot of little tools on the web because he's a programmer and he just likes to write stuff
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:03.400]   Most of them i think you're written for himself, but i like radio three i have a little bookmark in my bookmark lit
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:07.400]   in my toolbar and my browsers to radio three dot i-o
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:13.400]   And uh, this is now how i tweet so you can and by the way notice 280 characters
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:17.240]   Of course fixed it you could put titles links and closures
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:23.160]   Uh, your tweet will appear in this box. You can also have a cross post as i do to facebook as well as twitter
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:27.000]   You get a as a result you get a feed so you can see my
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:30.920]   In effect a link blog. I mean this was what blogs originally were right just
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.080]   lists of links
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:36.280]   And so this has automatically become a link blog. These are all the things i've
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:41.560]   Uh, i've posted at radio three and most and what they are basically is mostly news stories
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:46.200]   Uh very useful tool i have an if this than that script that automatically
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:48.200]   Takes what i post
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:55.480]   Here puts it on our pin board automatically imports our pin board into a google spreadsheet for our producers use so he can build the run downs
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:00.520]   It's kind of a nice little workflow and it's uh, i get up in the morning and i just read through all the news sources
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:06.520]   And uh, i click radio three whenever i want to save it. It does a very nice job and uh, oh my gosh
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:07.800]   Oh
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:10.120]   You got to tell ohm because this is home would love this
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:13.000]   When i when we were at giga ohm
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:18.360]   Probably three times in the eight years i was there he tried to start basically
