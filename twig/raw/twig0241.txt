[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is under the weather so we've got two people to replace him.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Two great guests. Kevin Marks will be here. Danny Sullivan, Gina Trapani, of course.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We'll talk about the latest in Google. Some new features, some old to say goodbye to.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And the big debate over whether these Google watches this Google wear will know too much about you.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   From people you trust.

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. The show that covers Google and the Google verse, the cloudy, partly cloudy Google verse.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Joining us right now from her mom's basement once again, beautiful Brooklyn, New York, Gina Trepani of SmarterWare.org.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hello.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Thinkup.com. Nice to see you once again.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Host of all about Android. Is Jeff Horst, is he losing his voice?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He lost his voice or thing. And he's also on the road so it was like bad internet connection and no voice.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He opted out today.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   He could take a nap instead of doing Google this week.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Interesting. Larry Page is using his voice at Ted, so maybe he stole it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Maybe he sucked the voice away from Jeff just for that one detector.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I think Larry Page has that evil power, actually.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That's Danny Sullivan. Search Engine Land.com. Marketing Land.com is great to see you once again, Danny.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   One of the most astute observers of the search scene.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That's really gone beyond search to SEO and everything else, too.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And of course, Kevin Marks is also here, who has worked at the Googleplex among many other places.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Nice to have you, Kevin. I appreciate it.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   See you.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Jeff's in London, right? Is that where he is?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   He is.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Maybe you can help him, Kevin. Can you recommend somewhere that he should go?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Well, to get his better voice and stuff.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Isn't there a guy there who helped the king? I think he is.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Go to Jeffrey Rush. He'll fix it all up.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Jeffrey Rush.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   If he just checks four square, he will find the places that I've been.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   My recommendations tend to be like 15 years old.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   There used to be a good pub somewhere around here.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh, right. It's a building now.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I know the hammer and tongs is here.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I know the hammer and tongs.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The London don't change.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The bits of London have been completely turned inside out since I left.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   There are new bridges and extra tube stations. It's bridges concerning.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   This is why it is no good to leave the homeland.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Well, now my son's at university there, so I can ask him all kinds of student history recommendations.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It started in a Google blog post yesterday, but now we've seen video and more.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Android is coming to wearables.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Well, we knew that Google had some great interest in wearables, both with a Google glass, of course, but also a Google watch.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But now, apparently, they're going to use Android, or they want you to use Android as an underlying operating system.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   For wearables, they call it Android wear.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And it is pretty much, in fact, we can watch the video as we expected, kind of a version of Google now for wearing.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And in this video, these are all prototypes.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Nobody's making it, including Google, by the way.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   This is something that at least Motorola and LG have announced.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   They'll make watches.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   As you can see right there, it's Google now cards that will pop up, even on a round device.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   That's the Motorola device.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Try counting.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Let's go to Zuma.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You know, I have to say, this is the first watch I've seen that has kind of a use case that gets me excited.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I think the addition of Google now cards is really valuable.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Definitely.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Google now is the hook here, right?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That's what makes me want this so bad.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And this video is pretty cool.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I mean, they're showing some interesting use cases.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You notice when he picks a watch up, it automatically shows him contextual information.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   There's two stops away from your destination.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Those women are dancing on the line, and they kind of raise their wrist up.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Google now tells them what song they're listening to.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Voice search.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I mean, and this is an interface that we all know and love already on our Android phones.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So seeing on the watch, it's like, oh, yeah, this makes complete sense.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Exactly.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You can say, what's the score?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   You can actually text somebody via speech.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You can, they showed the QR code for an airplane ticket.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Check in, you know, go through the check in with your watch.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   This seems like a good idea.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.280]   And it kind of confirms what I'd been thinking, which is that Google sees glass more as a
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.000]   way to learn about what wearables can be than as a particularly important product.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It makes more sense for them to do with wearables, what they did with smartphones, not necessarily
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   make them, but make the operating system underlying, make them run on Google.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Does that make sense for you, Kevin?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I mean, it makes a bit more sense.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I haven't worn a watch in a few years.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And the last thing I wore when I was with the exercise band thing that stopped working.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Right.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.500]   I can say it makes a bit more sense, but it's, it's, does it end up being a peripheral in
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.000]   the same way that the Google glasses?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Do you still have a phone in your pocket and this is just a little extra screen that things pop
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   on in the way that some of the things they've already built are?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That could make some sense.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.600]   I presume it doesn't replace your, your, your, they're not assuming it's going to replace
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.000]   the things you use the phone for entirely.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Are they?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I would imagine it's like glass of ties to a phone, I would think.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Right?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yep.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yes.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It is.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Okay.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.080]   I mean, when you make your app Android Wear ready, you're adding code in the app to talk to the
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.100]   Android Wear device, but it's running on your phone.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.560]   So when you dismiss the notification on your watch, it dismisses on the phone as well.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.160]   So this is an add on to your phone.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   Okay.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   So it's not like a Chromecast.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.800]   It's not, it doesn't sit there and do stuff on it.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.160]   You control it remotely, but it does stuff on its own.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.680]   Oh, but imagine using it with Chromecast as a remote control.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.880]   That would be a nice feature.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.760]   I, you know, to me, this is essentially, you nailed it.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.880]   This is glass.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.640]   It's just not on your head.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.600]   And by the way, it's called wearable.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.800]   It's not called watch.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   Right.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.280]   It's class, but I think it's better.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.920]   I think it's better to describe from all the videos as Google now on your wrist.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   Right.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.320]   Glass has Google now that comes into it, but what glass typically does not do is pop up
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   in my experience with all the same things I get with Google now when I actually open
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760]   it up on my phone.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.360]   And that's the difficulty with Google now is awesome.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.920]   I mean, it's scary.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Awesome.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.840]   How well it predicts stuff.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.600]   The latest thing I saw recently was I was popping it up and it was reminding me, you know,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.000]   that a television show that I wanted to watch was going to be on.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Oh my God.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.600]   Why don't you just watch it for me and let me know how it went.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   But glass is never.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   It's boiler.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   It's boiler.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.400]   The glass is just too bad for me.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   Right.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.680]   You know, if I have glass on, it doesn't pop up as a reminder, you know, I mean, or I
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.080]   don't have it on enough to whereas, you know, sometimes there's been cases where I haven't
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.200]   had my phone, but I would have.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.480]   And so when I do open up Google now, there's a reminder there, but you could see that this
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.200]   makes much a lot of sense to kind of give you those alerts on your wrist that comes in.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   So that's very, very compelling.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   And you know, I have, I brought up my Galaxy Gear watch, right, which has all these little
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.160]   notifications that come up and look, I can even tell that my Clash of Clans was rated
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   recently.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   It's very exciting.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   I get that notification too.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.000]   Which is actually kind of handy.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.240]   I mean, that's kind of handy.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.120]   But the Gear watch has really just been these sort of like notifications.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.000]   And what I find is, you know, every few minutes I'm just, oh, you have an email.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.520]   Like at some point, I don't need to know every email that's come in or every Twitter
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.560]   reply that I've got.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.840]   It's such a stream that I'm not in the mood for it.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.200]   But the Google now stuff coming in more selectively and things like that.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.400]   It looks like the Moto and by the way, Motorola has already made a site for Moto 360.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.900]   Motorola.com.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.900]   It's round.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.960]   How do you, Gina, as a programmer, what do you, do you just square the circle?
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.200]   You know, this is the first thing that I noticed.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.280]   I was like, oh, that's interesting because that changes the entire interface paradigm
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.440]   to centered, right?
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.400]   I mean, like when you, you know, the Android design guidelines and principles, you'll often
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.560]   have the hamburger menu in the upper left and the overflow menu in the upper right.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.200]   This is a totally different design paradigm, right?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.120]   Like for round screens like this, it's got to be more the Google now type card interface.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.920]   And the main content has to be the content that has to be absolutely legible and that
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.520]   the person has to be able to interact with must be in the center.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.680]   In the corners that get cut off, you know, can that can only be sort of a background
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.360]   image or whatever.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.720]   So that's pretty interesting, but it looks like from the...
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.360]   Well, potentially they can analyze the changes that, right?
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   I mean, this is the thing.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   This is the great thing about Android.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.380]   It's built to deal with lots of different screen sizes.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.880]   It looks like these cards have a pretty standard design.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.000]   And from the example code that I saw, it's not that difficult to extend your app to just
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.400]   interact, you know, to have these sort of actions, every simple actions on the watch.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.640]   So as a programmer, you don't have to worry like, "Oh, is this round screen going to
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   cut off my corner?"
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   The SDK does that for you.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.920]   Well, I think it's also why the card interface makes sense because cards are centered.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   Yep.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.480]   And so this is a different user interface.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.960]   And now we understand what Google was thinking.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.320]   And I imagine they were thinking this all along.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.120]   I really like this Moto 360 because it looks like a watch.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.800]   It's got a programmable face, obviously.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.560]   I feel like that's the big takeaway from Glass.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   They had to make a watch that just looked like a regular watch, right?
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.080]   Like Glass just doesn't, you know, it looks like you got like kind of headset on a little
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.040]   bit, you know, even with the new frames.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.520]   But this watch looks like a regular watch.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.440]   It doesn't look like you've got a nerdy Casio calculator watch.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.640]   It doesn't look like you've got this giant screen on your wrist.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   It looks like a regular watch.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.840]   It even looks like it has, you know, you can wind it up on the side.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.720]   Like that looks like a watch, you know, my grandfather's watch.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.280]   I doubt that you can wind it up.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   Okay.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   I'm just saying.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.520]   I want to talk about it.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.680]   I want to talk about it.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.240]   It would be great if they had, um, it would be great if they had figured out a way to,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.160]   you know, you have some of those, the, the kinetic things that will charge themselves
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   as you're walking.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   Because that would be neat.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.320]   The big downside I heard from the Moto watch that came out is that, you know, that they,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.960]   there's no, you can't plug in USB to charge it directly from apparently what they've said.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.240]   So people are like, and they, I guess the hangout they did today, they didn't exactly
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.280]   say how you can charge it, but the idea is that maybe there's wireless charging, but
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.560]   you know, that's been the problem with the Galaxy gear is that I go out on a trip and
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.480]   it's like, okay, now I got to take the little thing that I clip around it so that I can
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.280]   plug it in and charge it.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   That's a, I don't want a proprietary thing.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.280]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   You just be cable.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   So I just make that work.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.680]   I just gave my, uh, my pebble watch to Chad.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.680]   He's wearing it.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   I've been loving it.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   How did you charge it?
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   I couldn't find the charger.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.400]   So the moment you gave it to me without the charger, I went to Amazon and bought a charger
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.600]   and had a two day shift.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.840]   And so I got it yesterday.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.040]   How much is the charger?
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.600]   Seven, seven, seven, like nothing.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.880]   But that's a good example is it, and it's a proprietary charger.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.160]   There's no way you can charge it if you lose the charger.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   Um, good.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   And so you love the pebble.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.880]   I have, I have been absolutely loving it.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.840]   Um, it just like, as I was sitting down, um, Danny emailed me and was just like, hey, soon
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.160]   we're running a little bit late and being able to do triage super fast, look down at
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.840]   my watch, notice that Danny emailed that could be important.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   That could be not important.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.760]   And then you just kind of go down and it gives you the first few sentences of the email to
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   figure out what it is.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.840]   And it was, Hey, I assume you're running late.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.360]   I'm on Skype and it was just like, Oh, wonderful.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   I don't have to pull out my phone.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.840]   I don't have to pull it up anywhere else.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.320]   And I got it immediately instead of, instead of checking it, checking my phone 15 minutes
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   later.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.360]   Now, of course, this is the pebble and then one of the advantages of the pebble long battery
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.920]   life and cross platform.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.000]   It works with, uh, almost any device.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.960]   I don't know if Android where I guess it's going to require Android on the phone.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.400]   I don't know, but I would guess so.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   In fact, what it sounds like is if I'm looking at the developer site, your apps notifications
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.440]   will already appear on Android wearables.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.640]   That means your Android apps, right?
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.640]   Is it using the Google cloud notification thing, which is they already have a unified notification
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.240]   between browser and which works on Chrome OS and it works on Android.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.400]   If you use that API, I think they're using that.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.600]   Well, it does do that.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.200]   It does this, the notification dismissal across devices.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.040]   So you dismissed the notification or your phone, it gets, or sorry, watch it.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.360]   It gets dismissed on your phone.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.280]   And I believe from what I saw the developer site, existing apps notifications will work
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   in a rudimentary way on the watch out of the box.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.600]   But if you add a little bit of code, you can enable, you know, voice reply, for example,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.760]   if you've got a text, you know, you eat it.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.240]   And it does look like, of course, you know, the developers, the developer marketing video,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.880]   it looks like a pretty manageable bit of code that you have to add in there to make your
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.760]   app, you know, work with play with my and to Google's credit, they've, they've really
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.000]   made an effort to go cross platform, you know, game center or whatever they call it now,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   the Google play games.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.080]   Game is cross platform now.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.320]   All of a sudden, Apple folks can use it as well, which was so peeve Apple off a little
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   bit.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.320]   So, Gina, so I'm clear.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.680]   Does it sound like that it's possible that you could have one of these watches and it
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.440]   would still interact with apps on the iPhone as well through the cloud notification?
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.600]   I mean, or would it be that as long as it's, can iPhone app support cloud notification?
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.960]   No, not at the moment.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   Not at the moment.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   Okay.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   I'll be.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.280]   I mean, I bet you were headed that way.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   I would.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   I guess it would be interesting.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.000]   I think Google apps do, but I'm not sure there's the third party at the end of the
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   day.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Maybe that's the.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.720]   But if the watch is pulling, because the watch is going to probably depend on a data
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:11.200]   connection between your phone and if it's like Google Glass, you can use an iOS device
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.640]   to run Google Glass.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.000]   And in fact, you have the Glass app.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.160]   And so it would be interesting and really clever and it makes sense with the whole Android
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.520]   Wear name now that if it turns out that there's an Android Wear app that you can get for
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.480]   the iPhone that helps you set it up.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.320]   What surprised me was you remember it used to be the Android market, right?
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.200]   And then Google turned it into Google Play, which always to me was like, all right, we're
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.560]   kind of losing control of that whole Android thing.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   So we're going to put our Google brand back on it.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.280]   So when they called this Google Wear, I was sort of like, Android Wear, I was sort of
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.560]   like, oh, I guess we're all embracing Android again, rather than, you know, Google this
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.800]   Google that, but it is clever.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.960]   If you do that, then you can have people who want their Android watch or Android Wear device
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.440]   that they use with their iPhone, which then starts thinking, oh, the Android thing on
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   my wrist is good.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.120]   Maybe I should get one of those Android phones that maybe would work even better with it
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   or something.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.920]   It's so in the development.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.120]   It's a good question.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.560]   It's a really good question.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.320]   The code that I saw was clearly like extending your Android app to work with Android Wear.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.520]   But you're right, my glad there's a my glass app for the iPhone.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   Correct.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   And it connects to your glass.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   Is that true?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.360]   So the iOS does interact with glass.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.920]   Yeah, you can use this.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.400]   There's an iOS app.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.160]   I'm pretty sure that I have that on my iPhone with the glass app.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.880]   This is actually really exciting.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   If it doesn't, it's Apple preventing it.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   I think Google wants to do it.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.440]   My glass for it.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.280]   If you look at the developer's site, you can receive voice replies.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.120]   So you can, so if you want to customize it beyond the kind of simple notifications, it
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.240]   says your apps will, notifications automatically go to the Android Wearables.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.840]   But you can then have something like say, reply, and people, the system will deliver
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.400]   the text to your app on the phone for sending on.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.360]   You can add notification pages visible specifically for the wearable.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.640]   You can stack notifications.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.560]   That's kind of cool on the wearable.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.480]   And you can geo fence.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.720]   So you could trigger notifications contextually.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.000]   And that's what was happening.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.120]   I guess as people were, yeah, you arrive at the airport and pop up with your code.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.320]   But you can understand that stream for now.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:31.880]   Activity detection APIs will let you know if the user is bicycling, for instance.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.520]   You can gather sensor data.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.640]   Yeah, display it in real time on Android Wearables.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.360]   This to me sounds, this is what a wearable should be.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.440]   And this sounds like an API to Google now.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.080]   I mean, we forget Google now is Google's proprietary app.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.000]   It's not part of AOSP.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.640]   And this Android Wear, this layer where you can get your app to talk to Google to what
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   seems a lot like Google now, I hope that extends to the phone.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.280]   I mean, I would love to be from my app to be able to go and to plug into Google now
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   as well.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.120]   I mean, essentially, Google now might just become the super widget on your phone.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   We've got widgets, of course.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   But Google now is becoming the stream of all the contextual things.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.720]   So it's interesting to me, because I wonder, is Android Wear-- is there going to be an
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.440]   open source version of Android Wear or is Android Wear Google's proprietary extension
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.800]   that goes on top of Android that apps can talk to?
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.760]   It sounds like right now it's an extension.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.360]   It's a layer on top of AOSP.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:39.880]   Well, and the other interesting thing, too, is that it turns Google now potentially into
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   a Google-potentially centralized all the app notifications.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:50.280]   So again, if I go back to the gear, I have an app on my phone.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.840]   That app talks to my phone and then talks to my watch.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.240]   Where is-- if you're an app developer, it may be that your app is constantly doing things
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.080]   even if the phone's not even on.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.280]   So if the app developer is rather than trying to send the stuff wirelessly from the phone
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.080]   to your watch, it's sending it through Google now or the Google now API, whatever.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   And then it pops up as a Google now.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.280]   Then Google gets-- one of the things people talked about is, well, Google's going to lose
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.640]   control because everybody's moving to apps and it doesn't control all the apps.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   And so, OK, we won't control the app.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.520]   We'll just control the cloud notification systems for the app so that you have that synchronized
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   notification.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.800]   And the apps can go beyond just being on one device as well.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.480]   You can see it going further.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480]   You're watching TV.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.080]   Why wouldn't you want an app that has something to tell you necessarily to-- you might want
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.560]   it to pop up on your Google TV or your Google Chromecast or whatever.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.240]   I'm sorry we missed the Moto 360.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   Hang out.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.800]   Did you go to that, Danny?
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.320]   No, I've read a couple of CNET and I think Engadget had a thing on it too.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   It was interesting.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.040]   They talked a bit about the circular design, why they went that way.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:06.320]   They said it because if you have a rectangular watch then-- and it's that large, they felt
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.760]   like the circular actually makes it a bit softer.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   I agree.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.880]   They apparently said, women want to have big watches on their wrist too.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   So that'll be fine.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.920]   It's not just a fan watch.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.360]   It's not just man-sized.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.880]   They talked about the wireless issue, you know, that the wireless-- they talked about
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.120]   how the charge might happen.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.520]   It's water resistant, not waterproof.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:31.000]   Look at the-- in the Hangout, apparently one of the hosts, the woman on the right is wearing
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   it.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.200]   So as big as it is, it's clunky.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.640]   It's-- you know, but it's not-- I mean, I don't think it's--
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   Well--
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   It's a style of watch.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   It's a style.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   Some people like Chunky.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   I like Chunky watches.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   I do too.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.880]   Because of the battery, it needed to be the screen.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.440]   I think it's the battery.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.320]   Battery and whatever else radios it might have in it.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.040]   And they didn't put a camera in because they felt like it wasn't necessary.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.600]   And I have to say, that's been-- when you go back to the Galaxy Gear, it's like-- I
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.200]   mean, it's nice you got the camera in there for the odd occasion.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.520]   I want a novelty value.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:11.600]   But it's this $300 watch that doesn't-- you know, that if you dropped all this stuff off,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.200]   would have done, you know, just as much as I probably needed to have.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.760]   I don't want a camera because I don't want to get beat up in bars in San Francisco.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.840]   Well, camera and watch is going to win anyway.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   I mean, you can't--
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   You have the--
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   You know, you--
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.080]   It's going to be used for selfies.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080]   I'm assuming it.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   It's going to be weird, right?
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.560]   No, I have used it.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.240]   And I actually have gotten-- it's usually we're at like a restaurant and I'm playing
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.920]   and the kids are doing something and I just snap a little thing.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:41.000]   And it's-- there are odd cases where it has been kind of neat to have because I haven't
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.880]   had the fumble for my phone.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.720]   I've been able to just do a quick little shot or whatever.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.680]   But it's so rare, you know.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.920]   It's kind of like, yeah, when I have glass, I could just take a picture this way too.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.680]   And there are times when that's useful, but for the most part, you know, my phone is going
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.880]   to give you a much better picture.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.400]   And if they had dropped the camera out of Galaxy Gear and the price had come down, you
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.280]   know, that would have been one of the bigger things to think that would have helped with
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   it.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.840]   What's going to be interesting now, I think, is I just don't-- I just don't know what
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.000]   Samsung's going to do because they're progressing with their Galaxy Gear thing using their own
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.760]   platform.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.280]   And then I think Android Wear-- and this is getting way ahead of stuff or whatever,
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.160]   but I think Android Wear actually might come across as a much better sort of platform,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.080]   even for Samsung users because they can use it with a Samsung phone.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.600]   So then it's like, have they just consigned Galaxy Gear into nothingness with this?
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:38.120]   You know, it's cool if you download the SDK or the preview SDK, it has emulators for square
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.640]   and round.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:46.760]   So you can immediately see what your display is going to look like in the emulator.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.920]   And you'll know, am I going to get-- am I going to cut off the corners?
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   So that's good.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.720]   I mean, they're really preparing people for the idea that it might be on a variety of
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.360]   screens.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.760]   I love-- I am so excited.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   I am really excited to do it.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:09.040]   And I think that it's-- well, it's by by gear, Samsung's got to be going on on our ads.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.840]   And I think if you're Apple, you're starting to think, by taking our time here, we're kind
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.440]   of letting these companies get ahead of us.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.800]   And it's going to ruin our chance to sue them for copying us.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.320]   I don't know if that's Apple's going on.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.800]   I know that's what they're thinking.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.760]   No, but they must start to feel a little pressure.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.880]   Golly, these guys are already iterating and we haven't even hit the starting blocks.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.720]   But they need to wait a minute.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.160]   Is the difference?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.400]   I think everybody's been talking about-- and now Apple's going to come along and show you
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.480]   how to do a watch writing.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.600]   Maybe that will still happen.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:53.120]   But I think Google now is really such the key to what's going on with Android Wear.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.920]   Apple doesn't have Google now.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.160]   They've got Siri stuff and they've got something they can predict and maybe they can come up
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.280]   with a Siri that's sitting on your wrist as well.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.840]   But from what I have seen, the Google now data is so much more rich, especially in that
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.920]   it is coupled to Google going through your email and your calendar and all the other stuff
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.120]   that you do if you've agreed for them to go with that stuff.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.560]   It just perules these amazing predictions.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.720]   And so Apple, I think, will feel even more pressure now to turn their watch into basically
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.000]   a Siri watch if this looks compelling.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.080]   But then they also have to do much more to try to gather in some of this data and they
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.840]   don't have some of that data.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840]   I agree.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.680]   I think it's serious with some of that data of organizing the information.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.440]   So then what do you come up with?
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.720]   There's a little bit of barrier of entry right now.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.160]   And Google now is only good though if you are really hooked into the Google.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   Yes.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   What a surprise.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.600]   I wonder why Google would want you to do that.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   Well, right.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.280]   But it was interesting because we had, I did this, you know, we had the head of Google
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.840]   search and it's a goal and he was at our conference last week and I was saying to him,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.760]   so, you know, like, I was saying, so are you going to finally change the name of the Gmail
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.760]   field trial?
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   If you remember, that was what they did to say you could hook up Gmail to let Google
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.960]   go through it and let you to search to power Google now.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.560]   And he says, oh, no, it's already been that way.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.080]   And I don't remember that happening.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.440]   If it happened, it might have gotten past me, but I don't remember at some point where Google
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.480]   said now all your Gmail is being analyzed for Google now.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.080]   You know, I thought it was still something.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.920]   I bet it was in that unified, the unified privacy set.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   Right.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   Right.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   Right.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   And so that's, you know, that was a big change.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.680]   You know, seeing Google now's cards reminds me of like how much data I've given Google,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   right?
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.320]   And that's why Google now is only as good as the data you give it.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.920]   Like, I've set, you know, where my home is, where work is located.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.560]   You can, you know, I use Gmail as my primary email.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   I use calendar.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.840]   I add locations for calendars, time.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.200]   I add invitations to people who are attending things with me in calendar.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:03.160]   You know, if you're using, you know, I-Cal and your own iMac server and, you know, you're
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:09.600]   not signed into, you know, Google search very much like Google now isn't as, isn't as useful.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.200]   So I, you know, I think there are a lot of iOS users or, you know, who, who aren't hooked
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   into that.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.920]   And if they, you know, fired up an Android device and signed in with the Google account
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.520]   that they only used to catch spam mail, Google now wouldn't look that compelling.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   No, it's, it's crazy.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.880]   I was, when we were leaving, when I was leaving my, the conference, the other thing,
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.720]   you know, it was doing is just coming up and telling me like, I, it came up and I was like,
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.920]   I know I need to go catch my flight and I open it up.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.800]   And it's telling me like, you're seven minutes late to leave to go to your flight.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.640]   It's like going, oh my God, you have calculated where I'm at.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.860]   You know when my flight is, you've estimated how much time it's going to take for me to
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.960]   get from where I'm at to the airport.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.840]   And then you've assumed a certain amount of time for me to check in and yeah, it, it
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.200]   will open line.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.800]   And maybe we're just kind of weird because I know that some people say, oh, that's creepy.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   I don't want to give that much to Google.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.720]   Oh, for me to think this is what, this is what computers were invented to do.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.280]   Or I'm looking at it now and it's like telling me, you know, it's like, it's like, hey, here's
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.280]   your Amazon shipping.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   Are you going to be?
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   No, I'm looking at the market.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280]   The same thing.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.240]   And your typefall has gone and that's just, that's just from my email, right?
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.360]   I searched for jeopardy and now it's telling me when jeopardy's on.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.920]   And that's the challenge say an Apple faces is because in order to get that data, you have
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   to read their email.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   They don't get it.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.800]   And, you know, and then you have to store their email and go through it.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.240]   Of course, this is the thing that Microsoft puts up against it.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.840]   And this is the thing that involves the suit that Google's going with and just got dismissed
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.040]   as a class action, which is, you know, even if you're not showing me ads, you're, you're
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.280]   reading my email and doing all these things with it.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.760]   And, but you know, if you're comfortable handing it over to them, you get some pretty awesome
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.560]   stuff that comes back.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.440]   So, I mean, one thing that I find abusing about it is that it gets confused about how
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.600]   I travel because I sometimes like, and I sometimes drive.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.400]   So it thinks I would have cycled a San Francisco.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   It'll take me five hours.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.480]   But if you wanted to, I wanted to, it wouldn't be the way to do it.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.920]   But I'm, that I'm walking to work in Manhattan.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.800]   So like in the morning, it'll be like, you should have left an hour or three minutes ago
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.200]   if you want to make it to work on time.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   And I'm like, I panicked.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   And I was like, Oh, don't take the train.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.400]   Can you not go in the settings and fix that?
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.720]   It's just trying to encourage you to, you know, use public transit.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   One other.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.680]   So on this one, I can click it and say, but it says, how do you usually get around?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.640]   It doesn't say, well, if San Francisco, I go on the train, but if it's around the corner,
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   you're on my bike.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   You do both.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   And if it's, hey, it's early days, this car, I have a bucket.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.560]   I mean, the thing I actually do is I bite to the stage thing, get on the train.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.280]   It has no concept of that.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.440]   I think there's a state of the same problem because it was no, like, you know, I'm flying
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   by helicopter option.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.440]   Am I using the jet today?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   Nenn or Nenn?
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   Just get to see there's a cat helicopter.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.280]   Will I be having a flying helicopter jet or will I use the jet pack?
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.280]   A lot.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.640]   It really needs a roller blade option.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.560]   A roller blading, of course.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   Why switch to public transit?
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.880]   But it now says, Oh, you need to take the bus to the station.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.640]   It's like, no, I want to sign up to the station and take the train.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.240]   Well, they come on, Kevin, you're just a weirdo.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   I'm just a weirdo.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.560]   I think it's great.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.560]   It's going to get better.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.920]   And the more data points it gets, the better it'll get.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.520]   And where is going to take advantage of this?
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.800]   This all makes sense now.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.680]   When you look at what Android Wear does, this all makes sense.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.080]   We knew we were headed this way.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.440]   Have you seen this stuff?
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.640]   It says new content available.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.960]   So this is places I've looked at and the blogs I read and it started to show me somebody's
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   done a new blog.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   Is that notifications?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   Where is that?
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   This is now.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   Those are a research notification.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:59.160]   It's like, if it can tell or assume that you have been doing research on a particular
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   area.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   OK, so it's showing me an article that says, what might season two of True Detective have
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   in store?
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   Because I did some searches on True Detective.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.400]   But that's not searches.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.680]   It seems like it's keeping-- are those searches, Kevin?
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   No, no, this is--
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   This is sites you visited.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.680]   It's sites you visited.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   Sites you visited.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   This is my home history.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   Wow.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.200]   I'll go to XKCD and see if there's a new cartoon.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.040]   And now it says, oh, it's three days a week.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.440]   Here you are.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.480]   I completely freaked out my wife.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.040]   We had talked about on the show how American Idol-- how you can vote for the contestants
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.200]   in the Google search results.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.680]   But it was only during a certain amount of time.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.240]   So we couldn't demo it during the show.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.960]   So we're watching American Idol one night.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   And I just grabbed my wife's phone.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.360]   I just bought her Nexus 5 and searched for American Idol.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.800]   And then the next night, the results show was on.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.560]   And she picks up her phone.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.880]   And she switches over to Google now.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.840]   And she goes, oh my god, Google knows that we're watching American Idol.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   And I was like, whoop.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.120]   And I was like, no, no, it's not listening.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.360]   She's like, it's listening to the TV.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.840]   And it knows it's telling me I should vote.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.600]   And I was like, no, no, I searched for American Idol on your phone yesterday.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.560]   But I mean, it does do that sometimes if you have the right TV.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.840]   But it's not doing that now.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   Like shit.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.760]   They do have a pattern on that.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.840]   But they're not using it.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.720]   Right, it does do that for smart TVs, right?
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.240]   Doesn't it?
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.360]   It knows what channel you're watching.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   It does.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.160]   They have a pattern for actually listening to the sound of the TV.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.080]   But you have to do it.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.440]   So what it'll say is I see it does this to me all the time.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.520]   I see you have a Samsung TV turned on.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   What are you listening?
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.200]   What are you watching?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:25.960]   And then you press a button.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.240]   It listens.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.440]   It has to be live TV.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.480]   If you're DVRing in it, it doesn't.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.880]   What part of Google does this?
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.440]   The Black helicopter part.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.600]   The Google NSA joint venture.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.360]   I'm doing a little bit of a trace specs.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.840]   They-- that could be really bad though.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.120]   You have to have a TV on your network, obviously.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.760]   I prefer it to see it on the network.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   No, I have to--
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   What do you do with that?
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760]   What do you mean that?
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760]   Now.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.240]   Now.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.160]   Google now will do that?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.400]   Yes.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.760]   It'll say, I know you have a--
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.480]   I see you have a Samsung TV on.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.400]   Would you like to tell me what you're watching?
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:01.680]   It does now.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.480]   Yes, so my master, I will.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   Oh my god.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   It's worse than I thought.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.520]   And then I'll say, hey, do you want
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.440]   to vote for your favorite contestant in American Idol
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.120]   if you're watching American Idol?
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.960]   I think they're showing amazing restraint,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.440]   because in fact, they probably do know what I'm watching.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.120]   Or it says, hey, we voted for you,
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.960]   because we pretty much knew who you would have liked anyway.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.200]   So--
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.880]   You know, you'd like the voice better.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.000]   I don't know why you're still watching American Idol.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.520]   I just said that.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.040]   We sent them your post-quikins when so-and-so started singing.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.160]   So we voted for them.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.080]   Kevin Marks prefers the voice.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   Your watch was telling them, just put this watch on,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.520]   and we will vote for anybody who's inspiring you.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   And I got to admit, I feel guilty.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.480]   I love this.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.760]   And I feel like, am I Winston Smith just kind of walking
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.200]   into the brave new world?
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.240]   Or I've mixed metaphors.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.080]   But--
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.960]   No, if you go back to something like--
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.840]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.480]   If you go back to something like her, right?
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.240]   I mean, it was a great movie.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   There's also interesting things that you could talk.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.920]   But you know, you get this assistant that's
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.040]   helping you do all this stuff, and you're going, yeah, that's
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.640]   nice, you know?
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.480]   I have organized.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.720]   Oh, yeah, it's great.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.760]   And Google now does that.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.280]   So on the one hand, if it was a science fiction thing,
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.120]   you'd be like, oh, isn't that great?
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.080]   I've got the singer, whatever.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.440]   I think the reason that we feel uncomfortable with it
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.160]   is because in the back of our minds,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.840]   it's getting paid for in some way.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.520]   And that's getting paid for with the ads, which
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.000]   is the whole we are the product type.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.600]   I don't care.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.960]   That means I don't have to pay for it.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   That's great.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.400]   And lots of people don't care.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.440]   They don't worry about it.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.960]   But there is that sort of issue that they--
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.080]   no, I mean, I just came from a two-day at agency conference,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.640]   and they are--
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.440]   here's our latest way to track down people who are--
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.920]   Shut up.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.760]   I don't want to go--
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.840]   I don't want to go--
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.960]   I know, but they're going to hit you with those ads
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.360]   or whatever.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.920]   I don't-- first of all, I got to say something.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.320]   I would far prefer an ad that reflects my interest
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.640]   than one that doesn't.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.960]   I don't want to see ads for Frito's coin chips.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.160]   I don't mind seeing an ad for the hot new computer.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.240]   That's better.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.440]   You say that, but then you go back to that case
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   where the father was trying to understand why Target kept
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.560]   sending all this stuff for pregnant women to his house.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   And it turned out that his wife was pregnant.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.640]   Oh, that's an outlier.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.800]   That's an outlier.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.560]   I know, but it's an outlier now.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.920]   But when you start to understand
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.800]   or these sorts of things, and you start to really intimately
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.080]   understand what's going on with people,
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.160]   then you can start getting some targeted ads.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.360]   Well, then don't use Google, because I want it.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.960]   But it's not that easy, because even if you aren't--
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.920]   If you email me, then the my team has your email.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.400]   You can talk out of different things.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.240]   The profiles are being built up around you
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.520]   even outside of Google.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.160]   So everyone is getting profiles built up.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:40.600]   Well--
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.520]   Let me show you this from 1987.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.400]   Apple thought this was a good idea.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.040]   This was a video they made under John Scully, not under Steve.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.200]   Well, maybe Steve was--
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.720]   I think this was a Scully production.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.240]   They called it the Knowledge Navigator.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.920]   What was that, but this is cool.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.800]   And this is-- but this is almost 20 years ago.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.160]   No, almost 30 years ago.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.200]   And this is what they envision the future of computing,
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.000]   looking like.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.720]   And I got to say, finally, it's here.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.600]   And I thought this was cool.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.920]   I wanted this.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.480]   So he said, for those of you listening, he said--
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.600]   Your graduate research team in Guatemala, just checking in.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.680]   Robert Jordan, a second semester junior,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.080]   requesting a second extension on his term paper.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.680]   This is his little laptop talk.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.640]   And you're reminding you about your father's surprise
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.560]   birthday party next Sunday.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.800]   Today, you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.880]   You need to take Kathy to the airport by two.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   Mine is the guy in the bow tie on the screen.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.840]   This is Google Now.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.360]   On deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.800]   And I don't really want the guy with the bow tie.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   We'll do some of the lecture notes from last semester.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.400]   Computers are faster today.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.200]   No, that's not enough.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:55.960]   Very eye-paddy.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.720]   But it has visual effects on the screen,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.240]   which I remember a time thinking was--
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.000]   Oh, they never do that on cringers.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.240]   Your friend, Joe Guillen.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.760]   This is actually--
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.400]   A deforestation in the Amazon.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.720]   And it's effects on rainfall.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.600]   He's a professor.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   He's going to compare--
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.120]   It also--
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.600]   It's amazing how much--
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.120]   It's amazing.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   He's making a massive douche if you watch it,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   because he's like--
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.560]   Oh, he's a dick.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.360]   Don't put my mum through, do put my mum through.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.520]   Oh, let me phone up my colleague who
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.960]   actually understands Amazon rainforest.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.640]   So I don't have to do any work for my relationship.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.840]   Yeah, he's kind of a dick.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.760]   But--
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.080]   And maybe that was kind of--
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.360]   maybe what we thought is somebody who would be doing this.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.560]   You know, obviously he's wealthy, too.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.400]   This is Apple as well predicting how they
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.600]   can improve the life of middle-aged white men
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.200]   in the future.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:37.560]   And in this--
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.360]   This was Apple's--
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.080]   This was Jeff Raskin's dream.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.160]   This was Apple's dream.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   And I think they really did want to do something along these lines.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.520]   But to go back to the thing, it is the kind of thing,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.800]   douche guy or not, that you think that would be really useful.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   And the reason I think that some people don't get
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.160]   concerned about that happening is because you paid for it.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.640]   You probably paid a lot of money for your Apple Navigator
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.600]   device or whatever.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.920]   And Apple didn't make a lot of money.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.040]   And they don't know enough about you to make it useful.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.560]   Right.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   And so--
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   But I agree with you that this thing knows about it.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.040]   Very powerful.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.160]   And I both give it all this stuff
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.040]   and want to give it even more because it
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.440]   has become incredibly useful.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.040]   And yet there's still that part of you thinking, boy,
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.360]   they sure know a lot about me.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.080]   And that's why-- but that's an evolution of what's
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.760]   been going on with Search from the very beginning.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.240]   I often talk to people about Search engines.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.400]   They're like, people are always like, well, why are people
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.760]   just talking to start using Bing?
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.920]   And why won't they just go off?
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.720]   And why can't they stop using something else?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.000]   And I say, well, look, a Search engine
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.840]   is like your best friend.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.000]   That you turn to it every day and ask it things.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.560]   And in fact, sometimes ask it things
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.920]   you would not even ask your best friend.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.560]   And you have built up a relationship
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.120]   with your Search engine through these dialogues over the year.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.240]   And your Search engine predominantly is Google.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.720]   And it's come back with good advice.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.040]   And so when Bing comes along and wants to be your best friend,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.480]   it literally is like some new person coming up saying, hey,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.920]   hey, let's be friends.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.840]   No.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.840]   I got a friend.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.320]   I got a friend.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.720]   It already knows about my fungal infection.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.920]   I don't want to share that with you, Bing.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   So when you go to--
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.920]   Well, you know exactly.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   I don't know who you are.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   My medical problems.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   So--
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   They start showing up in your watch when you're dancing somewhere.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.240]   And so Google now is really becoming even more
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.280]   this personalization of Search.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.080]   I mean, Search has never been that you just put in keywords,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.160]   although, again, that's predominantly been how it's done.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.120]   But it is another extension of Search.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.600]   And it is another extension of our relationship with Google.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.080]   They've yet not given an acute C name, which is odd, right?
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.040]   Because Microsoft is going to have their Cortana.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.760]   And we have Siri and Google now.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.840]   Google now continues to be this product where it's not
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.160]   an application, but it's something else.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.120]   But it's a technology.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.880]   And I feel like they haven't quite closed the loop on what
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.400]   that is.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.520]   And maybe we'll get a name--
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.440]   I think they closed it in their minds,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.760]   but they haven't closed it publicly.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.680]   It really does feel as if this has all been strategized,
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.480]   that Larry has this all on a whiteboard somewhere from 10 years ago.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.120]   No, no, no.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.720]   They talk about the Star Trek computer.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.040]   They've talked about this in public at I/O last year.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.760]   And their idea is that computers always
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.920]   they're in the background.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.520]   And it knows when you're talking to it,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.840]   and then it gives you something helpful.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.200]   Or it will say, you know, cling ons off the Star Wars bow
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.760]   or something if there's something actually happening.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.280]   Thanks.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.000]   Yes, I have that 45.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.360]   That's why I have a smart toilet, because I
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.760]   want that kind of information.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.520]   We're going to take a break and come back.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.720]   Take a break.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.480]   We got to take a break.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.720]   This is really a good conversation.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.640]   Danny Sullivan's here.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.560]   Kevin Marks is here.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.680]   Gina Trapani.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.320]   More to come in just a bit, including
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.640]   what could be bad news on Google Voice.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.960]   And this is the other side.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.080]   To me, this is the only dark side.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.800]   But I heard you talking about it last night,
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.240]   and we're going to talk more about it in just a second.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.080]   But first, a word from personal capital.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.760]   Here's an example of how giving information to a site
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.200]   can be very, very useful.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.240]   If you're trying to keep track of your financial life,
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.640]   and you've got it on 18 different sites
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   with 18 different passwords, the idea
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.160]   of making it one dashboard where you can see all the information
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.440]   in a single place, and then act on it is just fantastic.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.800]   And that's exactly what personal capital does.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.320]   It's a wealth management tool.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.920]   You may say, but I'm not wealthy.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.240]   Guess how you get wealthy?
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.080]   By paying attention to where your money is, what it's doing,
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.600]   how much you're paying in fees, get an investment check out,
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.040]   find out what your fees are costing, get great insights,
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.640]   and great ideas for investments that you could make,
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.160]   unbiased financial advice, so that you can become
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.600]   at least well enough off to retire, wouldn't we all like that?
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.440]   Now's the time.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.200]   Personalcapital.com, if you visit personalcapital.com/twig,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.840]   you can sign up for this absolutely free.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   It costs you nothing.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.640]   And I promise you you will get some benefit.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   I started using this as a, but now it's almost two years ago
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.560]   when Bill Harris, who created the company,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.440]   was on our show on triangulation.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.000]   And I'm just a huge fan.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.680]   I know you're gonna like this personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.200]   It's free, and you will thank me.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.120]   Maybe not today, maybe tomorrow, maybe in 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:18.920]   but you will thank me.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.280]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.920]   The only thing, I don't see any negative
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.240]   to giving Google all my personal information.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.600]   I love it, I love the benefit I get out of it.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   The negative isn't whatever targeted ads
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.800]   or finding out my wife is pregnant when I didn't know it.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.840]   The thing I worry about is Google killing this stuff.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.080]   I'm dependent on it.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.680]   That's what I'm worried about.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.440]   Now I hear that Google Voice may be on the block.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.360]   - It's usually on the sausage.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.200]   It's like, oh, right.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.040]   - They all made it. - Right.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.880]   - Why are you dependent?
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.960]   Now we'll see you.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.080]   - I'm happily owned by Google.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.440]   - Well, wait a second.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.360]   Is that distinction really true?
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.480]   I mean, you can pay for a service
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.560]   and the company could decide
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.520]   it's just not good enough business.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.680]   - Absolutely, it's not to me.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.000]   - And decide to shut it down anyway, right?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.600]   I mean, that isn't really the difference
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.680]   between that-- - Yeah, but what's the benefit
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.840]   I get from Google, paid or not?
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.200]   It's not that I don't have to pay for it.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.040]   That's not the benefit to Google,
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.600]   'cause I gladly pay for it.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.440]   The benefit is that by aggregating all the information
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.880]   they get from all these different sources,
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.240]   they can make an amazing big data discoveries
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.520]   that are valuable to me.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.240]   - And the fact that doesn't, sorry, go ahead.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.280]   - No, you go ahead.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.120]   - Well, I was just saying,
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.520]   and that doesn't go just to them being able to target you,
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.600]   but it also goes to why it is so incredibly difficult
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.840]   for someone to compete with them,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.800]   'cause aside from the best friend thing,
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.680]   you had the whole antitrust lawsuit thing that happened,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.840]   which I always found laughable
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.560]   because it was competitors complaining
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.360]   they weren't getting enough traffic from Google itself,
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.720]   which to me was like NBC complaining
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   that CVS wasn't airing enough of its shows.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.320]   It was absurd.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   The real reality, if you were gonna go after Google
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.080]   and antitrust grounds to what antitrust,
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.520]   to my understanding, originally came out of was,
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.520]   you didn't wanna have a manufacturer owning
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   all the elements of production.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.560]   You didn't want the railroads owning all the land
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.480]   alongside the railroads, owning all the things
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.320]   that made the railroads, which provide the energy
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.560]   for the railroads, and you didn't wanna have them
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.160]   to have all this stuff because they can,
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.720]   could talk to think where somebody else can't compete.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.520]   And Google has so much data in so many ways
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.840]   that is incredibly difficult for someone
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.280]   like a being to go through and compete
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.400]   when they can harness all the stuff in his email
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.600]   or an Apple, right?
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.960]   But Apple's not trying to compete with them in terms of being--
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.280]   - No, Apple's taking the opposite tech.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.760]   We're going to be the privacy company,
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.640]   but there's a disadvantage to making that your goal.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.880]   - But it's not, I mean, Apple's taking the view by and large
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.960]   that we're gonna produce great devices.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.880]   Google is producing great--
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.760]   - Services.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.960]   - If you want applications, you wouldn't call it applications,
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.040]   but search is an application.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.640]   Google now is an application.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.600]   Information is an application.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.000]   And so, and you can also argue that they could both
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.280]   survive this because even if Google's devices are terrible,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.600]   the information application that they provide
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.680]   can show up on anybody else's stuff
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.880]   and in fact does show up on all sorts of Apple devices.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.280]   And even if Apple's information is lacking,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.920]   it as a beautiful hardware manufacturer could tap into
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.240]   if it wants to all the Google stuff that's out there as well.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.040]   And they haven't really totally solidified,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.600]   where they're just completely separate and you can't do it.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.240]   There's a lot of reasons why they can still work together.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.560]   I think the challenge tends to be like,
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.360]   if you're somebody who wants to compete on the information side,
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.600]   Google potentially has a weakness that they're not as good
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.840]   if you don't use their email, right?
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.600]   So, what do they do in that case to kind of pull you in
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.960]   and get that sort of information?
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.840]   Or what does somebody who wants to compete with them,
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.440]   pull in the email and do some of that stuff as well?
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.160]   - So, the reason I'm worried is because, for instance,
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.560]   Google Voice, which I live by,
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   in fact I just told somebody about it and he was all excited
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.920]   and he moved all this stuff to Google Voice.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.840]   And now I see from nine to five Google,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.400]   that they're planning to move it to Hangouts.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.840]   Now, you might say, oh, that's not a problem,
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.080]   they just move it to Hangouts, except they also moved
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.520]   other things to Hangouts and it didn't,
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.560]   not all of it went with it, like Google Talk.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.400]   So, I'm concerned about features disappearing.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.680]   I heard you talking about this yesterday
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.120]   on all about Android, Gina.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.960]   - Yeah, we did.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.240]   I mean, look, the promise of Hangouts was always
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.200]   that it was gonna be Google's unified messaging service,
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.920]   right, so you can see in that screenshot,
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.720]   Chad's got up, the icons keep disappearing,
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.440]   Google Talk went away, Google Messenger went away,
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.880]   it all got rolled into Hangouts,
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.680]   but we still got Google Voice out there.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.680]   Now, I mean, look, anybody that's been paying attention,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.360]   anybody that uses the Google Voice app,
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.760]   particularly on Android, can see that it is just old
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.560]   and creaky, it has not been updated,
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.800]   the design is just old, they have not been putting work
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.240]   into updating Google Voice, the app.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.040]   So, now they're saying, Google Nine to Five,
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.320]   Google's reporting that word on the street is that,
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.440]   Google Voice is going to get rolled into Hangouts
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.960]   and we're already starting to see some of that.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.800]   Like, somebody just called me before
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.000]   and in my computer rang, you know,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:16.840]   - Yeah, that's fine.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.000]   - I'm going to call someone in my computer, that's fine.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.040]   - Don't mind that.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.800]   - But if the Google Voice Android app goes away,
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.880]   that means, hopefully it means,
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.240]   that all the features of Voice go into Hangouts,
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.360]   that means voicemail with transcriptions,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.200]   call forwarding, filters, blacklist, whitelist,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.480]   I mean, Google Voice is such a great powerful application.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.120]   I love it, it is my primary number,
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.840]   it has been since it was Grand Central.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.120]   And yeah, I mean, my worry here is that some of the features
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.880]   are going to get lost in translation,
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.840]   lost in the transfer over and we saw that happen
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.360]   with Google Talk, right?
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.800]   And we saw what happened in Jabra, an XMPP.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.240]   - I'd be sad.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.800]   - And yeah, I'm kind of, I'm worried
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.080]   because this is the fault that everybody has.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.920]   - It's not like we haven't seen Google kill stuff
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   that we love before, Google Reader, Google Wave,
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.000]   they're capable of that.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.760]   And so, that's the other side.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.680]   By the way, let me show you the upside
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   of Google owning the world.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   I'm on this article from nine to five Google
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.280]   and I go along and say, hey, wow, that's a neat coincidence.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.200]   There's the ad for the gentleman's Emporium,
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.920]   I just visited for the first time,
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.040]   10 minutes ago to look for fake mustaches.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.160]   Well, of course, of course, it's a Google ad.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.040]   And, but that's fine, I would rather see that
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.280]   than an ad for lawn furniture.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.920]   That's stuff I'm looking for,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.040]   that makes sense for everybody.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.880]   All right.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.440]   - Human hair mustaches.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.160]   - Yeah, cheap, 10 bucks.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.160]   Reusable.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.240]   What are you laughing at?
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   It's time for the Google change log.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.880]   The Google change log.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.760]   - Janet Trapani has the latest from the Google verse.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.440]   - Well, beside the big Android Wear preview announcement
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.680]   this week, a couple of other new things happened.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.360]   First, Google, your search results on Google.com
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.320]   and your desktop are looking a little cleaner,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.160]   a little nicer.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.000]   Google rolled out the rare redesign
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.360]   with a few nice updates.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.080]   - I like the fridge's headline on this.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.240]   - Yes.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.200]   Yes, the word is headline is Google Reminds,
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.000]   removes underlying links, says goodbye to 1996.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   (laughing)
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.040]   So your links are no longer underlined,
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.440]   unless you hover over them with your mouse.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.160]   - It used to be, that's how we would know
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.440]   it was a link is 'cause it was underlined, right?
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.320]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.120]   - Yeah, I mean, it's still that old school default browser blue,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:40.960]   which I love.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.920]   - And the followed links are purple.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.800]   - The green links they put underneath are not actually
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.480]   clickable, which is really annoying.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.320]   - What?
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.160]   - 'Cause I always try and click it.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.000]   - Oh, that is annoying.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.120]   - They were never clickable.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.960]   - That breaks.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.800]   - I know.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.320]   - That breaks the web, that's wrong.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.640]   If it has a dot com app on it, it should be--
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.520]   - They were never clickable.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.360]   And in fact--
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.920]   - They were never clickable.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.520]   - Because they were never clickable.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.880]   (laughing)
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   They were never clickable.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.280]   - Because Marissa said something that hasn't happened
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.000]   for 15 years, but the reason, you know,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.280]   that the design is interesting because I asked the guy
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.720]   in charge of Google search about this,
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.800]   he was like, it's just an experiment.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.280]   And then the next day they're like,
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.240]   okay now it's official,
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.080]   if I have to watch--
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.160]   - It's a quick experiment.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.880]   - Seriously, the next day you had to make it official,
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.280]   you just couldn't say it.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.960]   But you would better ask the question of
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.560]   why do you have the URL listed when you also have a link?
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.840]   - And the answer is because people--
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.680]   - Yeah, I make similar--
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.520]   - Look at that URL.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.360]   - Yes.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.800]   - People, they have found people look at that URL
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.200]   to help interpret whether or not they want to go
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.440]   to the search results.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.040]   - That's actually very useful.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.680]   - The other thing aside from the thing,
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.200]   can you generate those search results again
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.320]   and bring up an ad, you know,
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.200]   just search for Mesothelium or anything
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.760]   that we'll have lots of ads.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.800]   The other really significant changes,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   can you spot the ad?
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.160]   - Well, it says ad, there's a big yellow ad.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   - And at first you'll think,
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.480]   oh, it says ads 'cause it's got that big ad next to it.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.000]   But the ads previously had a--
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:06.840]   - Box around them.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.720]   - They had color boxes, right?
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.120]   - There's a still a little thin line,
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:11.960]   a little harder.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.920]   - A little tiny, well yeah, but there's a delineation,
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.760]   so we're good.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.320]   But initially my feeling was,
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.520]   well, yeah, how could you miss those big orange ads?
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.040]   You go back and start searching now after about a week
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.320]   and I found myself struggling to understand,
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.520]   was that an ad or not?
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.680]   I had to seek out to identify that.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.520]   - So-- - That's the same thing.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.160]   - So an Android, interesting.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.760]   - Yeah, they may change it a bit more.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.480]   Well, yeah, because they like cards on Android, right?
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.320]   - Right.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.280]   - So maybe the next thing that will happen is,
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.440]   the ads will turn into cards at desktop,
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.880]   as everything turns into mobile,
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.720]   so that eventually they won't be mobile,
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.760]   everything will just be same things again.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.560]   But I think that that change that they made is significant
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.680]   and I think it is likely to--
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.520]   - Confuse.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.880]   - Cause people to, yeah, I think over time,
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.400]   people will stop thinking about that stuff as ads.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.840]   But then there's other things going on there
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.560]   where it's, do a search for Nest thermostats, by the way.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.520]   You'll like this if it comes up.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.360]   - Oh.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.560]   - All right, I think-- - You have to show me.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.360]   Nest, no, not Nest, but Nest thermostats.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.000]   - Okay, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, Chad.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.960]   - There you go, yeah, that's it.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.120]   Now, come over over there.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.840]   - Oh, wow, it went right to Nest.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.520]   - Hey, click on the thermostat and spin it around.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.640]   See the icon?
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.560]   - Oh. - Oh, yeah.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.000]   So that is like a whole new ad unit
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.960]   that they have tossed in that wasn't there before.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.120]   But you probably don't anticipate that looking
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.920]   like an ad unit because it looks a lot
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.120]   like the knowledge graph boxes that they have over there.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.840]   - It does, it says sponsored, but it does.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.760]   - Oh, yeah, I don't love this.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.160]   It does feel like trickery.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.520]   - Oh, yeah. - All you can't just do
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.880]   is just sponsored.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.720]   - Yeah.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.120]   (laughing)
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.360]   - Well, and if you go back to the Mesocelioma example,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   the right column has ad, but it only has ad once.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.640]   And then, oh, shoot, now I gotta type it in again.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.080]   Mesocelioma.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.520]   Why did you suggest such a really hard to type name?
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.320]   - Because, because as my joke goes,
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.000]   all those auto driving cars and Google Glass get paid
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.720]   for these by Nestlecobino.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.560]   - There you go.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.720]   - These are the ads that cost $100 per click.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.720]   This is how they make them seem so, yeah.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.760]   - So the ads, it does say ads at the top of the column once,
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.280]   but then the rest of the column does not.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.640]   And so, if you scroll down a little bit,
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   you aren't seeing ads on the left,
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.880]   but you are seeing ads on the right,
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.760]   but it's not clear.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.480]   There's no distinction at all now.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.720]   - So that they, technically they're labeled,
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.280]   but I think that over time, people will probably ignore,
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.720]   I mean, people already struggle anyways with the old system.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.560]   You would do surveys and people wouldn't necessarily care.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.960]   And to some degree, you can argue, it doesn't matter, right?
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.400]   If long as the information is relevant, it matters to me.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.760]   - I don't want to, you don't want to intermix those.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.160]   That's something. - I don't want to know.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.320]   - Couldn't you just be like a big honkin green box?
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.560]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.720]   It was green, that it was orange, it was purple,
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.200]   and you know, they go through all sorts of things.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.120]   It's like fashion.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.920]   - Can you, those could be blocked by ad blocks,
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.960]   ad blocking programs, all right?
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.000]   - Well, unless you're using the ad blocking program
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.360]   that Google has a deal with the not let their stuff get blocked.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.760]   - Yeah, right.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.000]   Though these are high quality ads, we're not blocking those.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.360]   - You could buy your way out of ad blocks.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.200]   - Yeah, plus.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:21.960]   (laughing)
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.880]   - All right, continue on, more in the Google Change log.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.680]   - Yeah, so no Android links and some other tweaks,
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.480]   bigger typography and better line spacing.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.600]   So, cleaner results, Google says.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.440]   Next change.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.400]   So last week we talked about this class action lawsuit
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.560]   by this mom who had handed her Android device tablet
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.160]   to her five year old who then purchased like $70 worth
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.360]   of in-app purchases from a game.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.000]   Well, the Google Play Store application on Android got an update
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.720]   or an update is rolling out, I should say.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:58.720]   New version 4.6.16 has a new setting, the Play Store.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.080]   You can require a password for every purchase.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.440]   You can, or sorry, the setting is called require password
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.080]   and you can say set it to every purchase after 30 minutes
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.600]   or never require a password.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.800]   So a little more control over how easy it is
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.400]   to spend money on these apps.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.120]   And hopefully, you know, your five year old doesn't know
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.440]   how to change that setting.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.280]   (laughing)
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.360]   And that's rolling out in stages right now.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.480]   Google Drive storage costs less now than it ever has.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   The monthly prices have been reduced to $2 per 100 gigabytes,
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.520]   10 bucks for one terabyte and 100 bucks for 10 terabytes.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.680]   This is, these are down, this is down.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.720]   This is a $199 for 100 gigabytes, that's down
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.360]   from the previous $4.99.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.000]   That new $10 plan is down from $50.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.120]   I mean, these are big reductions.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.680]   And the 10 terabyte is, yeah.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.480]   - One might almost say anti-competitive huge.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.560]   (laughing)
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.400]   Right?
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.800]   At what point is it dumping?
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.040]   - Right, right, I mean,
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:02.880]   they're deeply uncutting.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.840]   - I was trying to get the price of hard drives.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.760]   - But yeah.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.560]   - Well, it becomes dumping when it so undercuts
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.680]   the competition that everybody moves over
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.520]   and then they raise the price back up.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.720]   Right?
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.600]   - Google says that they made some infrastructure changes
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.280]   which made it cost effective for them
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.120]   to lower these prices and they're passing
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.160]   on savings to consumers.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.360]   And it's a pretty amazing deal, I have to say.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.240]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.200]   - You know, I can buy a terabyte drive for $120.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.040]   So actually I can buy a terabyte drive for $60.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.880]   So I could buy a local drive for that
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.960]   and then have it in six months.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.760]   - But think about what Google's costs,
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.880]   here's how you know whether it's dumping.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.840]   Is it below Google's own cost?
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.680]   - Right.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.440]   And the difference is, I think part of the difference is
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.280]   they used to store their stuff in Bigtable
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.800]   which made six copies of it and was complicated
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.920]   and was required to be more than one place.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.200]   And they have done some new storage architecture
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.720]   so that it is actually cheaper.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.560]   - Okay.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.400]   - At one point it wasn't just raw storage on one server
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.880]   because Google is designed to be very redundant.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.040]   - Yeah, they have many copies, yeah.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:04.880]   - Yeah.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.000]   So I think the part of this is what they said.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.600]   We've re-oxetated the bulk storage piece of this
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.440]   and this is behaving better.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.280]   - Yeah.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.400]   - The challenge I find with it is that I have,
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.720]   I mean, I already have like a terabyte or two terabytes
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.560]   or whatever that came with the Chromebook.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.040]   But my MacBook only has 500 gigs
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.040]   and I'm getting to that point where I need,
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:29.200]   and I have all, you know, I've got terabytes out of my ears
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.760]   with all the external drives around me
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.560]   but I don't regularly have them hooked up.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.640]   And, you know, I'm getting to that point
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:38.920]   where I want to have the physical Google drive
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.960]   like that is constantly talking and keeping it in sync
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.000]   because I love having the remote backup.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.600]   I would especially, you know,
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.160]   but I kind of need the physical side on my other end as well
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.080]   because I don't trust Google.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.080]   I wouldn't trust anybody
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.520]   but just I'll leave it all in the cloud.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.360]   But I don't have that.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.040]   Or, you know, if you get on to like a MacBook Air,
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.600]   I'm down to like 256 gigs.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.960]   So I can't have all that with me.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.680]   And so, you know, I would like to have that terabyte drive
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.600]   that's talking and maybe I can set it up
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.280]   and it's, you know, I just need to get around to doing that.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.520]   - I feel like it's, it becomes a viable backup solution.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.360]   - Oh yeah.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.800]   - And I think if you see it's less than Amazon S3, right?
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.440]   So, - You want to...
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.920]   - I can move, I'm now saying maybe I should,
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.320]   I have about 500 gigabytes of images over the last 12 years.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.080]   Maybe I should just put all my images on Google drive
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.480]   instead of somewhere else.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.560]   - Well, see, and that's one of the frustrating thing
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.880]   that's happened and I talked with Google about this before
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.760]   and I need to get back to.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.120]   But, you know, you do have a lot of storage
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.880]   that they give to you through Google+ photos.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.720]   But the difficulty is I have got photos,
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.720]   I pulled off my camera and I have the photos
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.800]   that I have auto uploaded.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.160]   And I have them being basically stored in two different places.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.280]   And when you ever try to go back through
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.920]   and use Google+ photos to sort through the stuff,
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.240]   it's a nightmare.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.280]   You know, they've improved it,
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.360]   but it's still one of these things
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.160]   where it's hard to scroll through all that stuff.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.280]   And I have a whole, I call it, you know,
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.240]   trying to get to a better digital shoe box.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.720]   And I did a scene article about this thing
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.840]   and I've explained like,
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.960]   and this is where I put all my folders and they're by date.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.520]   And then, you know, I'm, I can get to stuff with it,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.080]   but it's that remote backup, that sort of a challenge.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:15.000]   And I hate, I want the storage to follow up
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.640]   with a better way of locating things.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.800]   And when it comes to documents,
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.320]   it's not so much of an issue, right?
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.000]   I don't necessarily care because it's textual,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.360]   I can find it with the photos.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.960]   It's like, oh.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.440]   - Yeah, photos are hard index.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.600]   - Yeah.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.560]   And that's just backup though, that's all like,
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:29.960]   I wish they hadn't killed Picasso Web
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.680]   or weren't in the process of killing Picasso Web
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.520]   because that was a nice issue.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.480]   - And ever, ever pics didn't make it.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.880]   - And ever pics died, yeah.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.800]   - Google, Google's presumably more stable than,
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.640]   than ever pics.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.480]   - Yeah.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.160]   - Continuing on, I'm sorry.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.800]   - Last item, last item in the chain dog.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.000]   Last week we talked about a bug in Android KitKat
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.480]   that caused some apps that access your camera
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.880]   to just suck the life out of your battery.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.440]   The main app being Skype.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.760]   Well, Google's working on an update to Android
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.400]   to fix that problem, but in the meantime,
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.480]   Microsoft released an update to Skype for Android,
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:06.800]   which introduces aggressive battery savings, they say.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.760]   It includes a workaround for this KitKat bug
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.440]   and in order to save, to not kill your battery
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.200]   with Skype installed, it had to,
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.120]   it had to basically disable instant notifications
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.680]   of messages and group chats, which you can turn on
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.920]   in settings, but with the warning that it will,
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.120]   it will affect your battery.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.720]   So if you want to install Skype
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.520]   because you have that KitKat problem,
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.160]   you should be able to reinstall the new version,
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.040]   which I believe is version,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.440]   I don't know what version number it is.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.600]   You'll see it in the play store
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.280]   and you won't have that camera battery drainage problem
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.760]   anymore.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:40.600]   That's all I got.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:45.560]   - And that's the Google change law.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.800]   (laughing)
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:54.880]   Easily amused, easily amused.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.280]   Thank you, Gina, Trappane.
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.880]   YouTube is apparently building a version
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.040]   of itself for 10 year olds.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.680]   I thought that's what YouTube was.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.620]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.080]   They want creators to create child oriented content.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.120]   This is all from Jessica Lessons, the information.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.720]   A version of YouTube for those under 10
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.960]   is actually a great idea.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.240]   Because you don't want little kids to be brows in YouTube.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.080]   - It's pretty clear that my daughter's gonna watch YouTube
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.600]   a lot more than she watches TV.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.840]   I mean, we watch puppy videos on YouTube
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.520]   and she's thrilled.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.880]   She just wants to watch clips of cute puppies.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.920]   And I can see it, that's probably not gonna change much.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.400]   - Why would you watch Sesame Street clips?
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.880]   - Kids, two years old, know how to get a tablet,
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.120]   launch YouTube and watch videos.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120]   They just know.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.440]   So you really need to do something.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   And so apparently this is not anywhere near release,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.940]   but I hope this is true.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.640]   YouTube also has trusted flaggers.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.040]   Chad, are you a trusted flagger?
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.160]   - I don't flag enough.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.120]   - I don't think.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.160]   If you flag a lot, do you become a trusted flagger?
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.440]   - Yeah, I believe that it's based off of,
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.040]   one, how many times you flag, how many times you flag.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:08.880]   - Correctly.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.960]   - Yeah, it actually does get pulled.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.400]   - You don't want a bad flagger.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   - It kind of reminds me a lot about what Matt cuts
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.920]   was saying with the content ID that we were explaining.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.000]   - Humans are good at this.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.360]   - Right, and we always get put back up with content ID.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.520]   And so it should care more for people who constantly
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.600]   get back up.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.880]   And it seems like that's what they're doing is,
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.400]   if you flag, then it does get pulled.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.040]   Google has given roughly 200 people in organizations
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.400]   the ability to flag up to 20 videos at once.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.560]   And presumably when they're flagged by those organizations,
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.160]   they get special care.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.400]   And by the way, this includes the UK Metropolitan Police's
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.840]   Counter-Terrorism Internet Referral Unit.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.960]   It's getting rid of extremist videos, apparently.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.120]   And hopefully this just doesn't get--
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.880]   - That's all to help Dave Cameron with his,
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.240]   we can't have child porn,
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.400]   we've got to get me reelected campaign.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.960]   (laughing)
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.000]   - I'm not a great cynical member.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.880]   - I think we've got five for having child porn.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.720]   - Yeah, isn't that funny?
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.560]   - You see that part of that?
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.000]   - Yeah, his advisor, yeah.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.840]   - His advisor, all right, yeah.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.480]   Well, I don't know porn, but I know it when I see it.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.800]   And I see it, whoa!
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.120]   Viacom and Google settle their seven-year-old lawsuit,
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.680]   according to sources, on recode.net, no money changed hands.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.880]   This is really what kind of launched YouTube,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.320]   wasn't it, the Viacom YouTube lawsuit?
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.680]   That's what launched YouTube.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.160]   - Well, I mean, YouTube was already going.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.520]   It was, well, what's really interesting is you just like,
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.920]   - Seven years.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.560]   - It was almost a footnote yesterday,
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.000]   and when that happened, it was like,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.760]   this will kill YouTube.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.600]   - Yeah.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   - Kind of like the lawsuits when Google had,
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.280]   Click fraud will kill YouTube, or they're privacy thinking,
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.920]   you know what, lawsuits do not kill YouTube.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.040]   We got that point now.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.520]   But yeah, just to completely,
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.120]   it just shows you how much things have progressed
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.280]   in seven years where Hollywood has gone from,
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.240]   everything's infringing us.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.120]   We've got to shut it down to, you know what,
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.360]   we've had now seven years,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.200]   this is apparently enough time to get to the new reality.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.000]   And I'm not taking away from the fact that Google's had
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.040]   to catch up and make changes to make that happen.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.120]   But what a transformation from,
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.080]   you just deal all our content too.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.520]   We probably ought to stop suing somebody
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.040]   that we actually partner with all of this stuff as well.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.880]   - I said no money changed hands, but I forgot to mention
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.360]   that Google and Viacom's lawyers bought a very nice
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.360]   country home on the proceeds.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.200]   - Yeah, they did find by him.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.040]   - Yeah.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.600]   But I love this, by the way, at the bottom of the
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.720]   Recode article, Peter Kafka apparently makes the note
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.520]   that the CEO of Viacom's son, Philippe Dauman,
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.160]   works for Google and has his 2007,
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.840]   Kafka tweeted, "No more awkward chatter for Philippe
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.200]   "and his son to which Philippe's replied,
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.120]   "The son replied, 'Finally, I can go home
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.000]   "for Thanksgiving this year.'"
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.360]   Just kidding, almost forgotten the suit was still on.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.160]   I guess they don't talk about that on our regular basis.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.240]   (laughs)
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.640]   Philippe is working on the wallet program.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.200]   By the way, I got a problem with my Google wallet.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.280]   Maybe you guys can help us.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.880]   Oyster, you've heard of Oyster, that's the bookstore
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.000]   where you pay a monthly fee and you can read all the books.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.600]   It's kind of like Netflix for books.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.800]   Did I subscribe to that on a show once?
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.320]   Do you remember, does that sound familiar at all?
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.160]   - No.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.840]   - 'Cause I get a $8.99 charge every month
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.120]   on my Google wallet from Oyster.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.360]   - Okay. - That's nice of them.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.160]   - And I can't figure out how to stop it.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.480]   I have no Oyster account, can't log in.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.600]   - Have you considered having your credit card get stolen?
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.440]   (laughs)
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.360]   - I am gonna call Google.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.440]   Well, you know what I'm watching,
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.080]   'cause I only put $200 in the account,
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.000]   and it's slowly dwindling.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:50.960]   I'm wondering if I just,
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   what will happen if it runs out of money.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.040]   - I think it'll take an angle of paying.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.480]   - Will they, oh crap, I better call Oyster.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.840]   - So you didn't sign up for Oyster?
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.800]   - I don't know, I don't have a password.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.600]   It doesn't have my email address.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.520]   - But you know about it, like you've heard of it,
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.360]   like it's familiar.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.440]   - Well, that's why it could be,
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.040]   'cause I'm old and I forget things.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.560]   I could have signed up for it and forgotten,
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.160]   but I've tried all the email addresses
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.080]   and it doesn't know any of them,
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.640]   so I don't know what the heck's going on.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.320]   And of course, if you call Google,
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.560]   all you get is a Python script,
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.400]   so I can't go.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.800]   (laughing)
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.640]   I don't actually--
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.600]   - I've got to answer that high, so I'll go.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.360]   - If you call a wallet, you probably get a bank.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.200]   - So you've got that guy from the interns, right?
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.040]   (laughing)
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.880]   - You get Owen Wilson.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.440]   Hey man, or the other guy, the Indian guy,
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.000]   yeah, that's what you get.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.480]   - So if I click on one that's actually a subscription
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.880]   in wallet, a link that says manage your subscription.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.880]   - Yeah.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.720]   - Do you not get that?
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.840]   - Yeah, I get that.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.800]   Doesn't give you a chance to cancel it.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.720]   - Yeah, this one does.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.880]   - Oh, well, let me look.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.840]   So I sign in to Google-- - We'll put a music on.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.040]   - Sign in to Google Wallet.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.200]   Yeah, no, I can cancel that.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.640]   Let's see, transactions got music.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.720]   Oh, apparently I just bought into a club.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.240]   Actually, no, that was free, folks.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.040]   Okay, 50 Cent.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:10.880]   - That's a good song.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.160]   - Okay, transaction, here's a transaction.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   Payment methods offers subscriptions, okay.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.440]   Here's the subscriptions.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.920]   Google Play Music, Google Storage, Path.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.040]   There is no oyster.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.600]   They charge me every month, but it's not a subscription,
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.960]   apparently, it's just they charge me every month.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.320]   - They got your-- - Actually, it's $9.95.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.360]   Yeah, they got me.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.440]   I'm down to $4.75 in my wallet, so I have a feeling.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.440]   - Yeah, this is gonna get resolved in the next month.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.520]   - I click to link in the bottom right corner.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.280]   And there's a link that says the error resolution,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.120]   but it's just a gigantic pile of Lee Lee's.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:49.960]   - Hang on.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.360]   - Yeah, I know, this is the problem with wallet.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.880]   It is a credit card, you'd think.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.840]   - Well, it's a charge card, right?
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.760]   - Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.600]   - I'm so desperate for it to work.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.320]   - There was a phone that carried you a credit card.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.720]   - I know.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.760]   - It says, cool, one, eight, five, five, four, nine, two,
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:06.600]   five, five, three, eight.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.440]   - I will, I'll call 'em.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.080]   I bet 'em, because I realize I can't let this run out
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.800]   of money because then I won't get my music anymore.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.400]   Or apparently my storage.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.000]   So I have till April 14th.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.760]   All right, I just wanted to ask,
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.640]   if you guys remember me doing that.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.960]   Chatroom, do you remember me signing up for Oyster?
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.560]   (laughing)
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.960]   Apparently, once you check in, you can't check out.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.080]   I'm stuck, but I can read any book.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.080]   We're gonna run, 'cause Danny's almost out of time here.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.520]   - No, I'm hanging in there.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.360]   - Are ya?
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.200]   - Keep going.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.360]   - Yeah, you're not bored yet, okay.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.200]   - I'll run up to the three o'clock.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.960]   - You gotta play in the catch, Leo.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.680]   - I gotta play in the catch.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.440]   Oh, maybe I signed up for Oyster with my Facebook account.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.280]   That's awesome.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.560]   - I'm gonna cycle to San Francisco.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.600]   - Is it time you find ours?
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   (laughing)
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.640]   - You gotta leave.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.360]   - When we get there on eight, I need to leave at three.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.040]   - By the way, that is cool.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.160]   You gotta remember to check Google Play stuff
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   because there's always free stuff.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.520]   So I got a movie for free the other day
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.520]   and I got into a club for free.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.680]   So that's a good thing.
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.520]   Nobody's getting excited about that.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.000]   (laughing)
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.200]   Well, all right, I'm just telling you, free is--
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.160]   - Well, I've both paid them eight bucks a month
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.200]   and I can get everything for free.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.520]   So it's like-- - Oh, music, that's true.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.280]   What do I need in the club?
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.120]   - Why do I need to download--
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   - I can listen to that.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:24.960]   You're right. - That's true.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.800]   I've got all access.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.640]   - So do I.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   - So that's kind of weird.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.240]   - Well, but then I can have it on my device
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.760]   for when I'm in an airplane.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.600]   - Yeah, you can do that without--
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   - I can listen to it over and over again.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.480]   - Just do the little clip, clip you've pinned thing.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.320]   - And then you can do it.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.640]   - Just pin it. - Just pin it.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.440]   - Yeah. - Just pin it on the music.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.640]   - Okay, actually I've already done that.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.080]   - I'm trying to work out what that metaphor is
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.640]   is like you couldn't really pin any kind of physical media
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.360]   that contains music, could you?
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.560]   'Cause you'd make a hole in it and then we'd work with it.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.400]   - It is an odd, it is kind of odd, isn't it?
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.080]   - It's having a tact through a vinyl wheel.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.920]   - Yeah, it is an odd thing to do.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.840]   There's no real world analog for--
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.280]   And it doesn't even make sense because I don't own it
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.320]   but I can have it on my device, so.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.240]   - Yeah, it was just saying stick it here
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.000]   so that it works when your network goes away.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.320]   - Right, just use offline access, right?
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.440]   - Yeah.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.000]   - Transformers, dark of the moon and big, I got free.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.200]   - Oh yeah, Transformers, I think came with the next--
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.520]   - That was Flixster. - That was Flixster.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.680]   Yeah, and then but big was just free,
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.480]   was a little while ago was free.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.840]   That's a good movie. - That's a good movie.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   It is a good movie. - And you can see
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.120]   I own 302 'cause I like men with nice washboard abs.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.640]   So there we go.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.320]   - You can see them better with the monocle too.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.400]   (laughing)
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.960]   - Google Play, as I mentioned, has got iOS
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.200]   multiplayer support now.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.400]   I am amazed that Apple allowed that given that they have
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.640]   a directly competitive product.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.680]   But it's great for those of us who use Android devices
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.600]   and iPhone or iOS devices.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.240]   - Oh, and they launched Chromecast in the UK.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.120]   - Ah, today, today we got-- - That's what they do.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.160]   - Yes, congratulations. - And they have BBC
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.520]   iPlayer support for it.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.360]   Which would be really cool if I didn't use games.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.880]   - I'm so jealous.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.560]   - See, my goal is to get-- - Going to VPN that Google,
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.560]   a Google Chromecast from the UK
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.920]   and then just bring it back here.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.040]   But then you still have to fake the IP address.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.360]   - Yeah, you still need a tunnel on the device
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.320]   you're sending it from and on the Chromecast.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.760]   And then we have the address the Chromecast gets.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.840]   So you need it on both, which is kind of annoying.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.560]   - The only reason I want the iPlayer
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.760]   'cause it lets you see all the BBC stuff.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.120]   - Yeah, yeah. - I wanna see--
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.200]   - But just get a VPN, use that.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.320]   I'll look it up for you.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   - We have one ProXBN, one of our sponsors has a London server.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.640]   So you just go through their London server and you're local.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.960]   - I feel guilty doing that. - We have to do that
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.000]   at the router level so that both the devices can see it.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   That's the problem. - Right.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.280]   - I just feel guilty doing that.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.120]   - Don't feel guilty.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.320]   The British taxpayer is happy to foot that bill for you.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.760]   (laughing)
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.640]   I will happily pay a BBC license fee
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.880]   and cancel my Chromecast subscription if they'd let me.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.800]   - You know what, but Leo, that's the struggle.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.120]   I mean, I'm going far a foot, but that is the struggle
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.320]   is that there are so many people
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.920]   who would happily pay the BBC directly.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.440]   And it's not even it's just the case
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.120]   where the BBC is stupid.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.960]   It's difficult when the BBC has cut a big deal
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.880]   to distribute its content through BBC America, right?
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.720]   - Right.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.000]   - So then it's like they can't sell those sorts of things
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.480]   and you just like-- - But they do, but they sell them
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.400]   on iTunes.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.360]   They sell individual shows.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.000]   - Yeah. - Well, here's the show I want
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.160]   that I don't think I can get.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.400]   Maybe you can help me Kevin Mark.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.760]   Stephen Fry's QI.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.800]   - So those of it is on YouTube,
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.080]   just search for QI on YouTube.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.720]   - That's probably illegal.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.560]   - No.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.400]   - Oh, it's legal? - It's legal.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.640]   - All right.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.360]   - Every time I go to YouTube, it recommends me like 25 QIs.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.160]   - I love QI.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.280]   I think I've never seen it.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.200]   I want it seen.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.080]   - I wouldn't, well, it doesn't actually work
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:49.920]   for you binge watching.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.760]   You have to like space it out or you get sick of it.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.000]   - Yeah, look, I go. - Okay.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.040]   - My recommended YouTube's is like Stephen Fry QI.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.560]   - So Google's been listening
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.880]   and they hear your English accent
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.680]   and they know what you want to see now.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.560]   - Oh, I watched a couple of them on YouTube.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.360]   - Oh, I'm gonna do that.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.640]   - There's another one.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.920]   - So here's where I got the free stuff.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.240]   I didn't realize, now I realize,
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.800]   it's the birthday for Google Play.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.880]   - All right.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.880]   - So because it's their birthday,
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.360]   they're offering free apps, free music, free movies,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.200]   cheap albums.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.440]   See, this doesn't really look free
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.720]   when it's $11.49 for the album.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.680]   But here's in the club.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.480]   I maybe this was free and then now it's not free
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.440]   or I don't know.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:35.040]   What's up, gangsta?
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.040]   - Hmm.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.600]   - Anyway, happy birthday
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.360]   and I guess you can go to play.google.com and ask.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.480]   - I watched The Voice UK.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.040]   - Oh, what a great show that is.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   - Is it The Voice US?
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:48.880]   - Is it?
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.280]   - Are they good? - Through Weller?
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.360]   - No, it's just like different,
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.760]   there's no country music for a start.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.520]   But it's a bit of a different music and different judges.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.360]   - Yeah.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.520]   - Hey, what do we think of--
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.200]   - I'm just joking, broop briefly,
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.640]   'cause we covered it on other shows,
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.080]   but it'd be nice since we've got a smart people here
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.440]   about this thing that the US is gonna give up control
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.640]   of the DNS root zone is gonna let ICANN float freely.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.240]   Good or bad?
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.040]   Vince Surf of Google and one of the fathers of the internet
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.120]   said, "No, this is good.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.800]   "You don't want a government running the internet."
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   - I think, you know,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.480]   you don't necessarily want a coalition
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.200]   of international governments doing it either.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.720]   - Well, that's the problem is we're benign.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.840]   We at least think we're benign.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.120]   - Well, but we no longer think we're benign.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:33.960]   Is the other problem?
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.520]   - The NSA's ruined that forever.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.720]   - The NSA has completely ruined that.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.280]   So stepping back, that's a good thing in that respect, I think.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.040]   'Cause given all the stuff they've been doing
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.080]   about zero days and so on,
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.120]   you can imagine them finding a way to strong on that.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.080]   So if we can find a way from not to do it, that would be good.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.920]   - Right.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.760]   - Yeah.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.560]   And the Department of Commerce,
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.840]   who's been running it up to now says,
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.360]   "We're not gonna let Russia or some, you know,
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.160]   "we're not gonna let some rogue nation do it.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.280]   "We're not gonna let the United Nations do it,"
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.040]   which seems like a likely scenario.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.040]   We want it to be a cross governmental, non-governmental body.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.400]   I don't know why.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.360]   - Let me call this out to me.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.400]   I mean-- - Yes, it does.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.280]   I understand why people want that.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:24.240]   All right, I think it's time to do,
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.440]   to take a break and get our tool and tip
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.080]   and number and Danny Sullivan's thingy.

[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.840]   at a pre-negotiated rate.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.040]   They provide self-help services at your direction.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.560]   LegalZoom is there to help you start your business.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.800]   For instance, you can start an LLC.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.040]   By the way, it's completely doable.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.200]   This is how we started to it in 2005.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.520]   And frankly, we're still running on the same papers,
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   the same documents that I did way back then.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.640]   I don't know if I think it was 99 bucks then,
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.880]   plus the state filing fees.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.320]   You can also do an S-Corp or a C-Corp
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.280]   if you prefer that.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.560]   And maybe you're saying to yourself,
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.600]   well, what's the difference?
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:37.280]   S-C-L-L-C, that's when the LegalZoom lawyers can come in.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.200]   Their LegalZoom legal plans have lawyers in almost every state.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.440]   You can read their profiles and edited reviews from users
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.760]   and decide if that lawyer's right for you.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.880]   Call them up and say, well, which is it?
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.720]   LLC, S-C, what should I do?
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.480]   Trademark protection, yes, very affordable LegalZoom.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.680]   Same thing for your personal life.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.680]   Last wheel and testament, trusts all of the above.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.280]   You'd be amazed at how much you can do by yourself
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.800]   with the help of LegalZoom.com.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.040]   And I have to say, there really is no reason
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.280]   to pay an attorney hundreds of dollars an hour
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.480]   to do most of these documents.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.000]   They're very straightforward.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.160]   To celebrate National Start Your Business Month,

[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.120]   If you've been dreaming of starting a business,
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.240]   now would be a great time to do it.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.960]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.720]   I've got, well, I just have another one
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.000]   that I wanted to throw in, but we can do that.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.680]   Go throw it in, throw it in.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.240]   Kevin marks the news, never sleeps.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.040]   Well, this is, I mean, the Google Voice thing
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.880]   reminded me of this, because the challenge,
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.280]   there is this sort of tricky problem
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.480]   of how do I contact people?
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.640]   Because we have various different identifiers
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.240]   and different systems, we use it different apps
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.320]   for doing it and how we get in touch with them.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.280]   And the other ones are all trying to sort of,
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.200]   the Apple and Google and Facebook
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.840]   are all trying to take over your text messaging.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.440]   Each of their apps will take it over if you let them.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.920]   And one of the things we talked about
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.720]   at Indie Webcamp last week was how to turn this inside out
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.920]   and make it people focused.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:38.760]   So I put a link here to something Tantec wrote up about this.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.080]   And this is an interesting way of inverting it.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.320]   So what he says is,
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.200]   what you can do is you can go to someone's website
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.040]   and you can add them to your homepage.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.000]   And if, so if you go to KevinMarkst.com
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.800]   and do add to homepage on Android or whatever,
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.400]   you get a little face there.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.320]   It's like that shot in the middle
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320]   because I've set my fabric onto my face
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.400]   and a bunch of these people have done that too.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.040]   But the next phase of that is how would we make this work
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.880]   for someone who wants to contact me?
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.960]   'Cause at the moment, you can do it on Android.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.240]   I can add, I can pull someone out of my address book
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.560]   on Android and put them into the desktop.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.840]   But then it only gives me the ways of contacting them
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.280]   that I've already got in my address book.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.080]   It's assuming that the Google MediaTic contacts
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:24.920]   is the correct answer.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.840]   - Well, that's easy, you just use finger.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.640]   Right?
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   (laughing)
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.360]   - So that's why we need finger back.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.200]   - All right, go ahead.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.320]   - No, but fingers email based.
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.600]   So that's assuming email is addressing.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.360]   And we've got these like public identifiers
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.160]   that have email and phone numbers
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.640]   that if you have that, you can,
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.120]   you can test me one way or another.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.760]   You can make physical objects, make noise at me,
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.520]   or you can fill up my inbox with stuff.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.360]   - Like that bird, which seems a little upset right now.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   (laughing)
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.600]   - I think it's just like--
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.880]   - I think he's mating.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.280]   - I think he's the season.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.320]   - It is the season.
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.640]   - Little baby birds chipping in my ear.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.560]   - I apologize Matt and say everybody else who hates birds song.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.120]   If you're driving in DC traffic right now.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.120]   - So what Santa came up with was the idea of,
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.760]   okay, if you click on my website,
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.040]   what if you get a set of icons for the apps
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.960]   that we both use that we can contact me
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.360]   and we put them in the order that I'd like to be contacted?
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.440]   So, and then it was working through the ideas
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.440]   of how we can make this work.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.240]   'Cause you can actually put a link on a webpage
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.520]   that launches these apps one way or another.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.600]   There are different URLs for this.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.720]   So if you've got the app installed,
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.560]   then clicking on the link will work.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.760]   If you haven't, it won't work.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.520]   But you won't click a link, you haven't got installed.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.240]   So it's okay to put the other ones.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.840]   So naturally you'll match out the ones that you want.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.360]   So it's just sort of quite a subtle idea of saying,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.680]   I will serve a little webpage to you
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.440]   that has the icons of the apps that I use
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.920]   and you'll recognize the ones that you use
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.560]   and click on them and go through.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.840]   - So it's a great idea.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.200]   - So it's pulling it back from,
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.440]   everyone has to have everything in their address books
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.840]   and everyone's got a copy of one else's details
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.440]   to I'm managing this and sharing that with you.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.840]   The downside is you're publishing your contact details
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.720]   on your website, but the answer would be
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.080]   to publish the only ones you care
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.320]   that you don't mind anyone clicking on
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.760]   and you can still reject the call.
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.720]   And potentially later, if they've,
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.160]   you can do a login based version of this
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.360]   so you can see different people can see different things.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.760]   But it was an interesting way of thinking about
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.800]   that problem and it's a problem we have all the time.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.280]   It's like, how should I ping this person at the moment?
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.240]   And that's, I thought that was interesting.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.680]   So I find, you know, half the time even with my kids,
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.960]   I'm not sure whether I should be using Facebook
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.320]   or Hangouts or something else.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.320]   - Do you use as the canonical name though for these people?
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.800]   Would you use their email address?
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.560]   - No, you don't need to, that's the point.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.920]   The point is you use their website.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.760]   So--
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.680]   - Okay, your website, you use a URL.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.200]   - Just KevinMarkstalk, call on what time to say.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:01.320]   - Everybody has to have a canonical URL.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.480]   - But everyone has URLs.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.440]   - But you could specify that in your Google profile,
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.960]   for instance, as I do.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.800]   - Yeah, as you do.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.640]   - Right.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.480]   - Yeah.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.520]   - I like that idea a lot.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:13.920]   There's some other, there's a bigger decision tree
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.440]   about how I contact someone,
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:18.160]   then what's their preference and what I have access to.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.720]   I mean, do I wanna tweet, you know,
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.240]   140 characters publicly to Leo?
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240]   Do I wanna send him a link?
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.320]   I can't DM that.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.920]   I have to email, you know what I mean?
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.200]   Like, so--
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.040]   - But you could--
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.720]   - You could put all that in.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.680]   - But you can, if you see the set of icons
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.000]   that Tantec's saying he supports,
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.760]   and you can say, well, I like what did you use that one?
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.600]   - Right.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.440]   - And he'll just stop using the one
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.280]   that he doesn't actually read.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.000]   - This is a missed opportunity for the sites like about.me.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.160]   - Yes.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.680]   - Well, about.me is a missed opportunity because it's,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.520]   it doesn't do it--
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.360]   - Oh, it's my yachts now.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.960]   - You know, or somebody who bought them.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.800]   - It's a mess up.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.320]   - I think Yahoo, AOL bought them,
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.160]   and they bought it back, I think.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.080]   - And then the other one was just sold.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.840]   But it had a weird name that I can't remember, so.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.240]   - Right, but you know, the deeper,
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.080]   indie web thing is now have your own URL,
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.760]   don't have something that could be sold,
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.320]   'cause then it all goes away.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.760]   - Right.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.440]   - So we should all have a canonical URL.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.280]   - Yes.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.800]   - So is Tantec gonna move forward on the way?
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.520]   Would these be done with XF, what is it?
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.520]   XFCN, F.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.360]   - XFN.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   - XFN.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.560]   - Well, XFN is part of this, so you do, yeah, XF,
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.080]   if getting into the, into the techie weeds bit.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.280]   So XFN is just a link between sites saying,
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.200]   this is me or this is my friend or whatever.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.600]   So you would use Realm Me links for these, yes,
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.760]   because they're saying this is me elsewhere.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.400]   And one of the ways you verify Realm Me
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.520]   is you make sure both of them point in mutual directions.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.480]   If I point to Twitter and Twitter points back to my homepage,
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:53.240]   then I'm verified the connection from both sides.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.640]   And so you can actually use that for all,
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.200]   for one of the tricks we use for the indie web is indie auth,
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.560]   where I can use my homepage to log in,
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.400]   despite not having an auth server,
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.320]   because I linked to Twitter and Twitter links back.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.840]   So if I log in with Twitter, you can know it's me.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.400]   So it's a way of putting, of using all the effort
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.440]   that these big companies put into maintaining auth servers,
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.800]   but still being able to use your own domain.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   So there's that idea, but this is an extension of that.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.120]   This is saying my domain is the default place to find me,
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.480]   and here's a set of links to connect to me.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   So I think that was interesting in the lie
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:33.720]   of the Google Voice thing,
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.320]   because they're trying to coalesce the different icons
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.640]   down into one.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.400]   One of those posts was taking the icons
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.080]   and then reducing them down to one.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.120]   And the problem is that is removing the heuristic
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.000]   of how am I contacting this person,
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.400]   which you do by clicking it.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.360]   - Right.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.840]   - If I kick the Hangouts icon there,
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.340]   I'm not sure if it's gonna make a video call
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.920]   or send an SMS or make a text message.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.120]   And if it absorbs voice, it could do voice as well.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.880]   So that's potentially problematic.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.920]   - It seems to be very similar.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:04.880]   - Facebook does the other way around.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.080]   They have a separate messenger and a separate Facebook app.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.480]   And now they have Facebook.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.280]   - And that seemed to be similar with the confusion
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.880]   that I still find people dealing with
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.320]   when it comes to Apple messages.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.600]   It's like, did I send a text message
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.360]   or did I do this iMessage thing?
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.040]   And I didn't know which way it happened
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.680]   and which way it went.
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.240]   - Right.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.080]   Well, that's it.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.240]   - I have messages, yeah.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.240]   - Now we're gonna take a break.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.060]   When we come back,
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.560]   you pick your tips, your numbers, the week.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.240]   I love this idea and we definitely need this.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.640]   And I hope Tantec who has the clout to do it does something
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.440]   and we will promote it like crazy if he does.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.000]   - Yeah.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.440]   - I think it's a great idea.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.560]   We need some way of,
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.480]   but that's what finger was by the way.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.120]   I've got a protocol long lost in the annals of.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.320]   - I figured you did talk to somebody
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.200]   you may have addressed it would give you that plan.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.040]   - Yeah.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:56.880]   Yeah, I had a plan.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.200]   I used to have a plan.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.640]   I don't remember what it was.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.180]   Right now, I just, my plan is to have a nice meal,
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:07.380]   go home, put on my slippers, that kind of thing.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.940]   - We're gonna get back with more with Kevin and Danny
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:11.980]   and Gina, but first I wanna talk a little bit
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.780]   about squarespace.com, a better web for all,
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:18.400]   starting at your website.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.280]   Squarespace is the best hosting,
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.740]   never goes down, really high quality.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.700]   But the best software as well, in fact,
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.380]   one of the things I love about Squarespace,
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:29.580]   sometimes we see companies that do web hosting
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:32.460]   and offer some form of site builder,
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.260]   and they, all the sites look the same.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:36.420]   They all look kind of 1990s.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.220]   No, no, no, this is the beauty of Squarespace.
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.580]   You're getting state of the art modern web design
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.380]   with their templates.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.420]   Click the get started button at squarespace.com
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:46.420]   and you can actually play with these right now,
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.220]   free for two weeks, create a site, import your data,
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.420]   see what it can do.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.020]   First of all, 25 beautiful designer templates,
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:58.020]   more all the time, but also these sites are gorgeous.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:03.100]   Just right out of the box and easy to customize.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.780]   So it is in a cookie cutter situation.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:06.620]   Every site looks different.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.060]   In fact, when you go to a template, like here's Momentum,
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.140]   and look at the, these are real customer websites
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:14.820]   using Momentum, you'll see each of them looks very different
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.260]   as a different style.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.780]   Momentum is great for photographers
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.220]   because it's a full bleed design
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.700]   that goes all the way to the edge,
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.100]   great for giant images, but also great for a portfolio.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.700]   We can take a look, this is a photographer
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:30.460]   who's using the site, let the girls play outside, I like it.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.620]   Actually, I think this is a nonprofit.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.020]   That's the other thing, every one of these sites
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:37.380]   gives you a lot of nice features.
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:39.060]   They're all mobile responsive.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.620]   Looks like they're just setting this up.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:41.460]   Maybe not.
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.700]   Mobile responsive, which means they're gonna look great
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.860]   on any size screen.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:50.220]   I can even, let me squeeze my browser down a little bit here
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:53.140]   and show you that as we squeeze the website down,
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.380]   it resizes, everything resizes beautifully.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:00.660]   So you still get a great experience on the site,
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:03.260]   right all the way down to a three inch screen
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.780]   and all the way up to a 30 inch screen.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.300]   All of the sites have built in e-commerce,
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.820]   which is great too, because it means if you wanna
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.980]   start up a business, you can do it,
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.860]   but also even if you just wanna set up a donations page
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.500]   or a cash wedding registry, or maybe for your school,
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.540]   you wanna have a fundraiser, easy enough,
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.940]   set up a Squarespace site.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:27.580]   In fact, you do it for free for two weeks
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:30.420]   and take those donations when you decide to buy
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:34.140]   very affordable, $8 a month when you buy a yearly plan
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.060]   and that includes a custom domain name.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:38.140]   The professional plan, a little more 16 a month,
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.100]   still very affordable, gives you unlimited bandwidth,
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.020]   unlimited storage, unlimited pages and galleries and blogs.
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:47.860]   So there's a site that can grow as you grow at no extra cost.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.460]   And of course, they have fully e-commerce too,
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:53.220]   as many products as you want, services, products,
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.140]   physical or digital, but it also has real time carrier
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.900]   shipping, label printing, integrated accounting,
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:01.140]   and the custom domain name when you register for a year,
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.540]   24 bucks a month, you're gonna love Squarespace.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.740]   Get over there, start your site two weeks free.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:08.540]   If you decide you wanna buy, that's when you wanna use
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.660]   our offer code Twig, and you will get 10% off
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.900]   on your purchase.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:17.900]   TWIG is the offer code at squarespace.com.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:21.500]   Gina Trapani has our tip of the week.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.860]   - Oh, it's just a cute little Easter egg,
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.100]   but I just couldn't resist it.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.700]   We know that Google is kind of obsessed with the Konami code.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.860]   You know, up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right.
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.380]   They've got that Easter egg on the pixel
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.140]   in a few different places.
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:36.620]   Well, search engine land, thank you, Danny.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:41.300]   Points out that there is a Konami code voice search Easter egg.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.140]   Yes, yes. - Should I try it?
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.180]   - Yeah, try it. - Okay, let's see.
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:49.180]   Okay, Google, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.980]   Oh, so you gotta do it faster.
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:52.820]   What is it?
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.420]   Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, right, B.A.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:55.580]   - That's right. - B.A, right?
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.580]   - That's right. - All right, let's do it again.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:00.780]   Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B.A., B.A.
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:04.820]   - No, B.A.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:06.140]   - No, there's only one B.A. - You got any B.A.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.260]   - No, no, no, just left, right, left, right.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.580]   - Yeah. - Forget the, forget the--
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.660]   - That's not the Konami code.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.340]   - Oh, I'm sorry. (laughs)
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.300]   - Well, I got that, right?
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.940]   - Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:24.380]   - Cheat mode unlocked for limited free Google searches.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:28.380]   - I unlocked cheat mode unlimited free Google searches.
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:30.980]   For how long, Danny, for life?
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.780]   - For life. - Oh!
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.220]   - You know what's funny is we had a video,
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.180]   when we interviewed Amets ago, again,
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:38.980]   they had a Google search, I mean, I was interviewing
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:41.260]   on stage and they, we started out with this little video
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.740]   of all the things that Google conversation search could do
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.780]   and this was how the video ended and everybody laughed,
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.140]   but I don't think anybody thought it was real.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.300]   So no one, so it's been out there for at least a week.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.620]   Nobody actually tried it until today.
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.060]   - That's so funny.
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:59.140]   - So yeah. - Up, up, down, down, left, right,
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.100]   left, right.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:05.460]   - Cheat mode unlocked unlimited free Google searches.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.420]   - I love that.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:08.260]   If only it were true.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.780]   - I forgot the B.A.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.060]   - Yeah, am I wrong?
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:12.660]   Isn't there a B.A. in there?
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:14.340]   - Yeah, at the end, you're absolutely right.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.700]   Yeah, I'm surprised.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.860]   - It's the short code.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:19.060]   - It's the short code.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.060]   - I love it.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.260]   - So thanks Danny.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.100]   - Very nice. - Sure, cool.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.940]   - Kevin, you have said many things,
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:28.380]   but you have not yet said a thingy.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.740]   - So my thingy is 2048.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.900]   Have you guys seen this yet?
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:34.620]   - No, what's happening then?
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.620]   - No, no, it's not a year, it's a game.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.140]   So I've go to the first link, so this is 2048.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.180]   So you either hit arrows
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.020]   and you've got to curl less the numbers together.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.340]   - Oh, it's like threes.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.260]   - It is like threes, exactly,
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.540]   except it's twos, which are much nicer than threes.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:52.020]   You can have all that pink blue white crap.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.340]   They're just purr less much more easily.
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:57.060]   So this is, the danger of this is
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.660]   that you will spend hours doing this now
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:01.140]   'cause I have fallen victim to this.
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.460]   'Cause I did get to 2048 this week.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:04.580]   - You did?
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:05.420]   - Yes.
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.260]   - Holy moly.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.500]   So you're doubling every time,
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:11.900]   but to get to 2048, it's a lot of doubling.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:12.740]   - Yes.
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:14.140]   - Gee-mini.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:15.580]   - Yeah, I clearly, I have to have pressed it
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.660]   the key at least 2048 times.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.860]   - Is there a trick to this?
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.180]   Like, is it better to always go up, for instance?
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.980]   - I find it's better to try and keep things at the bottom,
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:30.260]   always go left down, right down, like that.
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.700]   - You wanna go down.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.940]   - Okay.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:33.980]   - And then, okay, less than,
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:35.460]   and then every now and then you have to move it up,
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:36.300]   but try not to.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.460]   But anyway, yeah, Gina, this will eat your brain
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:39.740]   'cause it's a very program-y game.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.580]   So,
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.980]   (laughing)
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:46.420]   - Oh my God, this is awesome.
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:47.260]   - Isn't it?
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:51.060]   - But then, then there are variations on a theme.
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:55.620]   So the next link is Doge 2048.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.620]   So if you go to that one,
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:59.700]   it takes away the numbers
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.340]   and replaces them with different Doge graphics.
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:03.820]   So as you coalesce the Doge,
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.260]   you get different pictures of Doge's.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.100]   - Oh, coalesce the Doge's.
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.140]   And this is even more relaxing.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:11.980]   And also,
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.540]   - It's even more relaxing.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.020]   - And it says little Doge things to you
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.740]   as you, as you make our lesson.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.420]   So I haven't actually won this one yet
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:21.260]   'cause I realized that I was-
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.100]   - You can win it?
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:22.940]   - In a bad way.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:25.180]   Well, you win it by getting 2048,
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.860]   which is the Doge's case.
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.060]   I'm not sure what the last doggies
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.980]   haven't got that far yet,
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:33.140]   but it gets sunglasses and different things on.
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:35.700]   And then someone did the next one,
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.100]   which is the Doctor Who edition.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.380]   (laughing)
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.540]   Because there are the right number of doctors
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:45.100]   'cause due to the 13 is 2014.
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.780]   So you start off with William Hartnell
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.540]   and then you keep coalescing doctors together
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.100]   until you get-
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.340]   - Here's my favorite version.
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:56.900]   You also have this Jenny Pangs version.
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.740]   - So Jenny Pangs,
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.340]   this one starts with 1024 in every square.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.180]   - I win!
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.600]   (laughing)
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.600]   (laughing)
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.200]   You can't lose!
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:12.960]   - Atticling performance, yo.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.800]   - All right, all right, all right.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.840]   - Then there's the next one.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.040]   - Yeah?
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.080]   - This was, well, if that's too easy for you.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.680]   - Oh, she's Louise.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.080]   Can you get two nine owls?
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.160]   - One, nine, two, five, four,
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.360]   give you the power of two.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.800]   And it's really big chord.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.560]   (laughing)
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:32.280]   - I can't even fit it on my screen.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.120]   - Anyway, it doesn't fit on the mobile phone anymore.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:38.040]   - So this one is actually easier
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.800]   because there's too much space.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.640]   - Right.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.560]   - So you can just see any object here
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.400]   and it'll basically work.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.280]   - It's easier, but it takes a long time.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.240]   - But obviously you're not gonna get to that number
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.280]   because that would take you like 30,000 years.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.880]   So don't play this version.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.040]   - No, I wanna win.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.120]   (laughing)
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.520]   I'll see you in 30,000 years.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.360]   - This is-
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.440]   - Can you imagine if you get all the way
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:03.520]   and then it fills up and you can't get to the number?
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.760]   - I have a feeling it's going to crash and overflow actually.
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.440]   - Fails by them filling up.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.880]   - No, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.200]   there's a number of towels, isn't it high?
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.320]   Anyway, so there's companies,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.320]   one is this is a terrible brain virus
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.440]   that will lose hours of your time.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:21.880]   - This number, by the way, is nine quadrillion,
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.160]   seven trillion, 199 billion,
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.600]   254 million, 740,992.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.440]   - There we go.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.320]   I'm just gonna waste two to the power of what though.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.160]   That's a-
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.400]   - Okay, that's your next challenge, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.040]   Chatroom get to work.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:37.880]   Is there Flappy Bird 2048?
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:40.000]   Yes, there is, you ready to play?
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   (laughing)
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:41.840]   - Of course there is.
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.360]   - Of course there is, where's the link?
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.280]   Where's the link?
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.240]   I'm in the wrong chatroom.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:49.240]   - And it even made XKCD today.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.520]   That's how famous this thing is now.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.600]   - Oh man.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.200]   - I guess I got booted out of my own chatroom.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.600]   (laughing)
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.880]   - So much for that.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:04.360]   - So, but the other fascinating thing for me is that
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.960]   this version, there were versions of this before,
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:09.760]   but this version actually works really well on mobile
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.720]   because the swipe gestures work with it.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.960]   And it runs, whoever wrote the original one,
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.480]   Gabrielle's Gessirulli, did a good job
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.720]   of integrating the swipe gestures
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.040]   and making it responsive.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.440]   So I've been playing it on phones and tablets and things
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.640]   as well as on the browser.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.560]   On the desktop, you can just use arrow keys.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.800]   On the phone, you just use swipe in the direction
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.000]   because it coalesces in the direction you swipe.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:33.840]   - Very cool.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.920]   - But the other fascinating thing is
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.160]   it loads much faster than threes does.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.440]   So I'm not sure what threes doing
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.080]   while it's animating that little word at the bottom.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.280]   - Yeah, no kidding, 'cause this is really not that complicated.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.120]   - But it's also a marker for a web app versus mobile app,
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:51.080]   which is one of those eternal debates.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.680]   It's a marker that the web platform is at a point
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.040]   where you can actually build a game
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.160]   that takes over lots of people's brains.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.920]   And I've definitely seen this sort of gradually eating
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.520]   the geek community over the last week.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.240]   I've done my bit to make that worse.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.080]   There we go.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.680]   - I love the ZXKCD.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:11.320]   The talk, this will be a very,
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.040]   a joke for very smart people in a few weeks.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.400]   The talk is in room 8224.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.360]   What? Oh, nice.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.360]   Sorry, nothing.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.960]   Great, now spend the rest of my life noticing numbers
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.000]   that would make good 2048 compounds.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:28.960]   8224.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.160]   I love XKCD.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.640]   - Squish the two, the four and the four and the eight.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.000]   'Cause the satisfying thing is when you get one,
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.120]   you're poking them around and then suddenly you get like,
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.640]   this set of powers or two that you can collapse together.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.880]   So you have two weights that goes to the 16
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.200]   and the 16 goes to the 32 and the 64 of it.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.000]   You go, shh.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.400]   So it is a very,
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.920]   - It's two to the 63.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.920]   9.22 quintillion itself.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:58.760]   - Yeah.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.000]   Two to the 63, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.200]   - So someone asking, are there cheats for it?
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.920]   There is a long discussion on stack overflow
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.080]   about the best algorithm for solving it.
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:08.920]   Yes.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:12.600]   - Of course there's a long discussion at stack overflow.
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.240]   - I just got 1,024 on that one.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.280]   - Whoa, on that one.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.000]   - Yeah, that one's easy.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:20.840]   - Yeah.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.640]   You've still got to go to two to the 63.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.080]   - But I got two 500s,
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.640]   which I can't imagine how many left rights it took
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.520]   to get to the best.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.120]   - You might be able to get to 9 quintillion pretty easily,
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:30.960]   actually.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.520]   I don't know if it takes 30 years.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.240]   Jeff, I want you to work out a program
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.680]   for figuring out how long it will take.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.320]   - You have to hit the key at least that many times
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.840]   or at least half that many times.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.840]   So you have to hit the key to the 62 times,
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.200]   which is a lot of times.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.280]   - No, no, it's just 62 times.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.120]   - No.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:45.960]   - No?
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.800]   - Oh.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.160]   - If you were really lucky.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.560]   - No, 'cause it only drops in,
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.240]   it only drops in two's fours.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.640]   Okay, so it doesn't drop in anything bigger.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.480]   Okay, so. - Right, you're right.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.000]   I get to say. - Two to the 61 times.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]   You could get away with it if you got a lot of force.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.120]   - Oh, God, I'm lost to this.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:03.360]   (laughing)
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.240]   - I should have done Jeff's thingy last.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.320]   I apologize.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.920]   - I've just destroyed every bit of Jesus' productivity
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.920]   for the next day. - We've lost everybody now,
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.600]   but Danny, if you want to mention something, go ahead.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.760]   - Hi, sure.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.320]   Sorry, I'm not on mute.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.280]   This came in, Mike Elkin wanted to make sure
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.120]   we didn't miss it.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.200]   It just came out today if you have Google search
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.720]   and you go, okay, Google, take a picture.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.640]   Google search's results will open up an app
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.920]   for your hairbrush. - Oh, that's nice.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.000]   - And then you take your picture.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.760]   - That's nice. - Oh, I guess I just took it too.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.800]   - It takes it as well. - And then that's,
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.440]   it's funny, it launched fun.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.960]   I was getting it set up on the Samsung
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.400]   to show that it would do the same thing and it did.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.240]   (laughing)
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.520]   It already did, it's sitting off to the side.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.880]   In this case, it's the, you know,
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.960]   on this was the Nexus 5,
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:57.000]   so it's always listening for those words.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.880]   On like the Samsung, you have to have the Google search
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.160]   and have it open. - That's the trust, yeah.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.800]   - And if you say, okay, Google.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.760]   - Oh, it works. - Okay, Google,
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.600]   we're gonna be here. - I just said that
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.560]   my Nexus 7, that's awesome.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.160]   (phone ringing)
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160]   - I did hit. - Opening app.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.040]   - There you go.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.800]   - And you all have seen the, you know, the Moto X,
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.520]   okay, Google now, what's up?
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.880]   That's awesome, I love that.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.560]   - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.840]   - That made me jealous.
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.080]   - Moto X is awesome.
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.440]   There'll be a new one this summer,
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.240]   maybe you can trade in your HTC one.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.720]   (crowd laughing)
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.280]   Okay, Google. - That's a spike, Google.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.240]   - Take a picture.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.440]   (crowd whistling)
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:40.240]   - Okay, currently he's taking a picture of Danny.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.240]   (laughing)
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.400]   - This is, it's not doing this.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.560]   - No, no, it doesn't, my Nexus 7 doesn't wake up
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.040]   when I say, okay, Google.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.880]   But if I tap, take a picture.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.080]   - I should pretty check for updates, isn't it?
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.880]   It doesn't.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.640]   (crowd whistling)
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.960]   Pretty cool.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.240]   - This freaking game.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.800]   (laughing)
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:04.400]   - I think it'll take 20 more to eight.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.360]   - Totally.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.920]   - Can I real quickly just throw in a pick of the week?
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.080]   If you are on Android, this is really cool.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.400]   Mark Hanson, who does a Twitch Pro for Android,
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.680]   said it was too much to add Chromecast support
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.040]   for the Twitch Pro app,
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.240]   'cause it blew it up by quite a few megabytes.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.120]   So he's made a standalone app,
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.840]   Twitchcast for Chromecast, that is very simple.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.240]   You just put it on your Android device,
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.680]   you need of course a Chromecast device,
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.400]   and those of you in the UK now can use this as well.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.800]   And you can send the live video
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:42.800]   or downloads directly to your Chromecast device.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.280]   Thank you Mark for doing that.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.760]   That is really a nice thing to do.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.880]   And we really appreciate it.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:50.800]   Twitchcast on the Play Store,
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.800]   and of course after you send it to your Chromecast,
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.000]   you can control it.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.040]   Very nice, and it's free,
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.640]   although there are in-app purchases.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.160]   I'm not sure what you get.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.160]   Let's see, what do you get with the in-app purchase?
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.000]   I don't know.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:01.820]   (birds chirping)
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.400]   Be here somewhere, what's new?
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.080]   (birds chirping)
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.880]   Those birds are quite...
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.520]   - It is, spring is in the air.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.880]   (laughing)
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.600]   - Ladies and gentlemen, we just better wrap this thing up,
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.440]   otherwise.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.240]   - It is like the thing in Snowcrash
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.560]   which is selected via text programmers, isn't it?
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.400]   (laughing)
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:20.240]   - Yes!
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.600]   - It's a brainworm.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.400]   - It's a brainworm.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.960]   - I have to load up this webpage
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.080]   if I get on the subway tomorrow.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.320]   I'll play this all the way to work.
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.040]   - Well, I'm sure there's a version on Android.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.080]   - Yeah, there's gotta be right.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.200]   - I think there's an official.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.640]   - So, some of us have to sit in an app, yeah.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.960]   - There's no...
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:36.800]   There's no 24.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.640]   - That's a 24.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.480]   - That's a 24.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.640]   - It just caches everything, 'cause it's a...
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.480]   - Yeah.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.320]   (birds chirping)
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:42.880]   - It doesn't need to download anything.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.880]   - Right, right.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.640]   There's no 2048 on the Android.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.080]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.440]   - Yeah, well, someone's made an app for it, yeah.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.280]   There's a record for it.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.120]   - Oh yeah, okay.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:54.120]   So you can get the app.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.160]   There's a lot of them.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.000]   Holy cow.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.840]   - It won't need...
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.680]   You can just keep it.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.520]   And the other thing I realized when using this was that...
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:01.880]   - Jesus.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.360]   You know what has happened?
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:07.600]   It has captured all the programming cycles of the world.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:10.800]   They've now written 3,048 apps.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:11.640]   - Yes.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.480]   - And more to come.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:14.400]   These are all 2048 apps.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.240]   - Yep.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.320]   (laughs)
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.160]   - Wow.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.680]   - Oh, it's a web app.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.280]   I can make an app for it.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.600]   It's like, why would you need to?
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.480]   No, but the other thing I realized while playing it
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.880]   was that the other reason that iOS people hate web apps
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.600]   is that if you click a link on iOS from Facebook or Twitter,
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.160]   you don't get to the browser,
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.040]   you get a web view inside the app.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:37.600]   And if Twitter goes to sleep and wakes up again,
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.000]   you lose that web view.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.280]   Which means if you click to 2048 in Twitter,
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.040]   and then the doorbell rings
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.080]   and you put your phone in your pocket,
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.120]   you come back and you've lost the game in progress.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.040]   And that was really annoying.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.960]   So I suddenly realized, oh,
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:52.000]   this is why iOS people hate web apps.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.240]   Because half the time they're not actually in the browser
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.440]   when they click on the link.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.680]   Whereas Android people always are in the browser.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.000]   - Mm.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.040]   - So that was one of those subtle platform affordances things.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.640]   - Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna thank you for joining us
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.240]   for this insane edition.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.720]   This was lots of fun.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.560]   Kevin Marks.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:12.640]   - It's a lot of fun.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.880]   Where could people find out more about this great initiative
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.080]   you're doing with the independent, with the IndieWeb?
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.160]   - If you go to indiewebcamp.com,
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:26.020]   that's the best place to look up that.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:28.680]   IndieWebcamp, we run events every so often.
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.920]   We just have one in San Francisco.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.080]   It's one in New York in April.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:33.920]   There's some others planned for Portland
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.720]   and possibly Paris and definitely Brighton.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.560]   So there's more of them there.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.880]   And there's a good set of links there.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.320]   There's also an IOC channel that's linked off that page
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.160]   to talk to people.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.320]   But that's the best place to start,
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.480]   definitely at indiewebcamp.com.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:48.960]   - You're starting a game of Venom, aren't you?
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:50.680]   This is great.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.400]   - Well, there's a nice page on there
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.640]   which we call generations.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:56.320]   And this has been a bunch of geeks doing geeky things
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.600]   and you have basically had to write code
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:59.360]   to do any of it for a while.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.840]   And one of the nice things about the last IndieWebcamp
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.840]   is that Dan Gilmore and Scott Rosenberg came along
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.400]   and were able to get themselves up and running
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.840]   on IndieWeb just using off the shelf WordPress
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:15.120]   and some plugins and things and connecting up to this.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.720]   So, but our sense is that it's getting to the point
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:20.560]   where you don't actually have to have your own site to do this.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.240]   You don't have to write your own code to do this.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.720]   But that was definitely the design center for it.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.120]   It's very much community that was built around.
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.280]   No, let's actually build things
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.920]   rather than talking about building things.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.080]   That's been in its DNA.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.840]   And that means it took a while to ramp up.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.120]   But we've now got lots of people building things with it.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.000]   Here is the official most recent picture.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.360]   And look who's on the computer.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.520]   That looks like a familiar face there on the computer.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:47.360]   What?
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.960]   That's, it's bear.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.640]   It's bad. Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.840]   It's bad. Mike Taylor.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.240]   They were most attended.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:53.920]   Of course he did.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.520]   Bear doesn't leave his cellar anymore.
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.240]   (laughs)
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.960]   Nord is Gina Trappani.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:00.320]   She doesn't leave her mom's cellar.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.640]   We don't love it.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.480]   We love it.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.320]   Still playing this game.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.880]   Yeah, she will never leave.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.720]   Best score, best score.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.360]   Never leave. Gina Trappani is at, of course, thinkup.com.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.000]   Soon to be public.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.080]   Soon to be public.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.200]   Yes, in fact, we're doing a preview tomorrow.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.080]   So if you put your email address on,
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.800]   on to our waiting list, you'll find out about it.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:21.720]   But it will be public.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.840]   Gina, what do you mean you're not public?
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.400]   Nobody can get it yet?
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.960]   Sign-ups are not public yet.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.880]   Yes, we opened up sign-ups for an hour
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.600]   and all of our servers died.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.920]   So.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:35.080]   So when do you, what happens tomorrow with the preview?
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:36.400]   What's happening there?
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.840]   Oh, we're opening up sign-ups for a three-hour window
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.520]   from 9 a.m. to noon Eastern
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:43.800]   to really test out our new architecture.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   We moved to Amazon and added a bunch of more servers
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.000]   into the mix.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.080]   And if that goes well,
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.840]   we will open up to the public entirely next week.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.000]   But if your name's on the mailing list,
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.760]   you get first chance at claiming your username
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:56.680]   and signing up with our new architecture.
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.280]   So fingers crossed, it's gonna go really well.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.960]   I love the insights I get from my think-up.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.800]   I'm lucky you guys.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:03.640]   Oh my God, it's awesome.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:05.120]   Yeah. Absolutely awesome.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.960]   I gotta get something written ahead of you going public.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:08.800]   It's just-
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:09.640]   Show my page, check check.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.760]   My favorite thing is it comes up and says something like,
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.120]   you used I and me.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:13.960]   No, I get that one a lot.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.480]   27 times last week.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.880]   It's like to talk about yourself,
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.280]   but maybe you're talking a bit too much.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.080]   I get that one a lot.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.320]   I get that one a lot.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.240]   Oh, you get to get this question for Niele, was it?
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.800]   That was a meal.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.800]   I just wanna be clear that-
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.400]   Oh, that was a meal interesting, huh?
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.000]   Yeah, that was a meal you wrote that copy.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.760]   I tweeted 33 times last week
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.840]   at 16 more tweets than the prior week.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.840]   It just really is so clever that Twitter should just buy it
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.480]   before you even open it and then just give it to everybody.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.200]   Yeah, yeah. It's just so-
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.040]   Yeah, it's wonderful.
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:45.880]   It's just so great.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:48.120]   I am just thrilled.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.720]   These are my biggest admirers.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.440]   But enough about me, that's the one you're talking about, Danny.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.280]   Lia LaPort status updates contain the word,
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.720]   I mean mine or myself three times.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.720]   That's what I'm talking about to be.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:02.040]   Three times out of 33 is not bad.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.040]   Not bad, it's not bad.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.040]   In fact, I think we're gonna change that super percentage
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.040]   versus total, 'cause I think that that makes more sense.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.440]   Yeah, that's great stuff.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:11.720]   So the problem I have with it is that
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.120]   when I do the live tweeting thing,
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.160]   that reduces my average number of retweets a lot.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.040]   So that, oh, you're average retweet.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:20.880]   Was I any-
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.880]   I also like the one where it tells you that someone saw
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.680]   so much more because you retweeted it.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.520]   Although I want the other people to know that.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.760]   I suppose that's what the sharing fact would allow you to do.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.200]   You can send them little screenshots.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.120]   Look.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.200]   Well, that's it, but that's what I, yeah, it's, I, anyway,
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.800]   it's cool. You can share it and be like, you're welcome.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.720]   Yes, exactly.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.280]   President Obama received 4,000 more.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.080]   Say that, say that, at conference last week,
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.120]   they, I retweeted them and they came up to me
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:51.480]   and he's introducing to somebody else and they said,
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.200]   oh yeah, this is Danny, you know, like 300,000 more people,
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.360]   which is all my thing because of it.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.280]   And I was like, are you using think-up or is it just-
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.120]   (laughing)
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:01.800]   Like, I'm not even wearing that.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.040]   You know, I want to know who's like giving me thousands
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.120]   of retweets.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.840]   So, I have to get them to sign up, so I check it.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.440]   I want to reverse it.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:14.120]   If someone retweets you who has like a significantly more
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.880]   followers than you do, like think-up will tell you that as well.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.160]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:19.840]   Well, that's really nice.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.840]   It has to be a multiple, I think, of your followers.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.720]   I forget what the rules are, but I think it has to be multiple
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:24.560]   of your followers.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.360]   I'm pleased to say I just crossed half a million.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.680]   I'm very happy about that.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:28.840]   Congratulations.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.840]   It'll show up.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.680]   And retweet me more.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.680]   Okay.
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:33.680]   'Cause then I'll get- (laughing)
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:36.680]   Kevin Marks got half a million more views thanks to you.
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.680]   Right.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.680]   Exactly.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.680]   Danny Sullivan's at searchengineland.com.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.680]   I think you probably gathered from watching this show that
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.680]   that is a site you must read each and every day.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:47.480]   He's also on Twitter @dannysellivin.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.680]   So, retweet him.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   Oh.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680]   It's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's- it's
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680]   I think I just told you I didn't post anything to you on
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680]   Facebook last week.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.680]   (laughing)
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:54.680]   Aw.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:55.680]   Gee, what a shock.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:57.680]   I kind of used Twitter in my own side of the-
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.680]   ... at Mooten Facebook.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.680]   And this is one PM Pacific, four PM Eastern time.
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.680]   That's 2000 UTC on Twitter.TV.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.680]   Please tune in and watch live 'cause we love it if you do.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.680]   But if you can't on-demand audio and video, although if you
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:12.680]   listen to the audio, you're just gonna get a lot of bird song
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.680]   available after the fact.
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:15.680]   (laughing)
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.680]   On Twitter.TV/Twig.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.680]   Oh my God.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.680]   It's just really taking over.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.680]   I feel like we're in a Hitchcock movie.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.680]   It's in the video.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.680]   The birds are in the video too.
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:26.680]   Really?
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:27.680]   We haven't- we don't take it out of the video.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:33.680]   (laughing)
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.680]   We'll see you next time on Twitter.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:37.680]   Bye!
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:44.680]   (music)
