[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.280]   This is Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.760]   episode 6 for September 5, 2009.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.000]   All your o's are belong to us.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.840]   This show is brought to you by listeners like you
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.040]   and your contributions.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.200]   We couldn't do it without you.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.880]   Thanks so much.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.720]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.440]   the show that covers Google and cloud computing.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.040]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.320]   And we, as always, have a great cast
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.800]   of characters here starting with Gina Trapani of smarterwhere.org,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.280]   founder of Life Hacker.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.040]   Hello.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.160]   Great to see you again.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.560]   Good afternoon.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560]   Good to see you too.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.520]   Somebody asked me, do you have any formal relationships
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.360]   still with Life Hacker, or is it just
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.440]   as a kind of consulting emeritus kind of thing?
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.800]   I do.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   I write there once a week.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.000]   I do a weekly column there.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.560]   And I'm in close contact with the whole editorial staff.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.120]   And they syndicate posts that I do on smarterware on Life Hacker.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.400]   And my name's still on the sidebar.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.800]   So yeah, I still feel really close to that editorial team.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.360]   I'm just not doing the day to day at the wheel kind of stuff,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.040]   Adam is.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.000]   That's probably a nice feeling, huh?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.760]   Yeah, it is.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.440]   It's really nice.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.280]   To sit back a little bit at your advanced age,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.560]   it's nice to relax.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.880]   Yeah, you know, it's good to be able to retire and kind of let
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.960]   the young and stake over.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.720]   That's what I think.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.080]   Jeff Jarvis and I are going, Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.900]   He is the Buzz Machine at BuzzMachine.com,
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.320]   longtime journalist and observer of journalism.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.160]   And the author of a great book called What Would Google Do?
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.240]   A business really, I guess a business book for people
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.320]   who can use Google as their model for--
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.840]   They have the money to pay for books still.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.360]   They do.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.600]   Like the reason the Wall Street Journal still gets subs,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.280]   you know?
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.400]   So because it's Labor Day weekend, we don't have a fourth.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.640]   Although we thought maybe Matt Cutz would join us the last minute.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.360]   And it's still possible, he will.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.600]   Google Blogger, he works on anti-spam stuff for Google.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.520]   But also, it's very out there and talks a lot about Google.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.760]   Like we have a lot of great people on tap for future episodes of this show.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520]   So there's a lot to talk about.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.720]   I was mentioning just before the show began,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.520]   we have a Friend Feed Room for this show.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.840]   As I'm doing with more and more shows, I finally figure out how to use Friend Feed
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.680]   right at the point where they get sold and are about to go away.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   Maybe, I don't know.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.320]   But the Friend Feed Room is friendfeed.com/twit-twig.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.040]   And that's where our stories go.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.560]   And Gina, Jeff, and I-- and actually, I've added a couple of other people
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.080]   past co-hosts or guests on the show and so forth-- can pipe stories into there.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.480]   So there's kind of a place for you to go if you want during the week to see
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.400]   what we're thinking about talking about on our show on Saturday.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.840]   But also for us to kind of keep in touch with what's going on.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.640]   And the way Gina has set it up, and I've set it up, and Jeff has set it up,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.560]   we have-- we just tag something undelicious with the word twig,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.400]   and it goes boom, right into the room, which is really nice.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.360]   So Jeff and Gina were going back and forth, and Jeff asked for her advice on that.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.800]   And I just thought it was so go-laught.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.560]   His response was, once again, what was it-- it's like asking Picasso how to paint your barn.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.040]   I love that.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.800]   We're getting help from Picasso.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Otherwise, no, Gina.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.960]   Yeah, so are you.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.600]   Here I have this huge-- this little tiny problem, and the best expert in the world
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.440]   comes in and fixes it.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.520]   Isn't that nice?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.200]   Isn't that nice?
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.640]   So kind.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.840]   That's too kind.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.800]   We're very lucky to have Gina around on our show.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.960]   And of course, Gina and I feel the same about you, Jeff.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   So it's--
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800]   Absolutely.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.000]   --it goes around and so forth.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.600]   Are you feeling a little better about Snow Leopard, Gina?
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.200]   I am.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.520]   I am feeling better about it.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.000]   You wrote some blog posts on it saying, you know, it's not so bad.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.040]   Yeah, yeah, I did.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.360]   I wrote up a post, actually, in my column at Life Hacker.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.680]   It was like, here are the things that you get as a user, not as a developer.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.800]   And there are quite a few of them.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.560]   And actually, my tip this week has to do with Snow Leopard.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.440]   It does better seamless syncing with Google Calendar.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.120]   So yeah, I am feeling better about it.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.040]   I'm running it right now.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.280]   I'm using it right now.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.640]   And it's faster.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.160]   It's better.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.800]   I like it.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.240]   I like it.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.920]   Maybe it shouldn't have been free, but it was $30.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.120]   It was just the perfect price.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.240]   Like I said.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   I guess you and I both heard the howls of paint for people like Merlin
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.160]   who foolishly, as it turns out, tried to upgrade all six of his production machines
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.480]   at the same time.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.960]   Yeah, poor guy.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.360]   That was an amazing essay, by the way.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   It really was.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.880]   It really was.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   Quite the meltdown.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.400]   But I think my message is still the same to people is that unless you see a reason
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.720]   that you need it, and there are reasons you might want it, there's no hurry.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.640]   The problem is the Mac world.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.800]   Everybody just upgrades right away.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.200]   It's like, well, I'll get the latest thing.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.120]   And Steve says so, so you do it.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.800]   Exactly.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.400]   And in the Windows world, people usually wait until they buy a new machine.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   I mean, there are lots of people.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.920]   You see Windows 98 and Windows XP.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.400]   There's not that same urgency.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.320]   And so I think Mac people can be told at this point, don't feel that urgency.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   You can relax.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.760]   You don't have to rush out and get it unless you see something you really need in it.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.200]   I completely agree with you on that.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   And in fact, there's an update.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.680]   There's 1061 is in the works now.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.360]   They've seeded it out to developers.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.760]   So I mean, I think there's always a little bit of risk of being the early, early adopter.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   I don't know.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   This is totally subjective.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   But I think Mac users are generally a little more tech-savvy, a little nerdier.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.400]   And they want the upgrades faster, you know?
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   Well, they tend to be enthusiasts, don't they?
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   Definitely.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.240]   So the big story of the week was Gmail out for about a hundred minutes earlier this week.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.000]   I'll tell you, it's funny.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.040]   We've come to just expect such reliability and uptime from Google, more so than almost
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   anybody else, that when it's down, there are howls.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.360]   I mean, people acted as if they were going through withdrawal.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   God died.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.040]   Yeah, it was crazy.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.280]   I was kind of surprised about it.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.360]   You know, it was a little painful for me personally.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   It was September 1st.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.680]   I had an editor waiting for copy.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.040]   I had clients waiting for invoices.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.600]   But yeah, I really didn't think it was that big a deal.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.240]   I mean, a hundred minutes without your email, it shouldn't be that painful.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.760]   I mean, I really think that we need to kind of look at ourselves and think about, you
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.000]   know, what's important in life.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I'm shaking.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.600]   I have an alternate email address.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.960]   It's like, you know, the world doesn't come to an end.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.440]   I don't mean to sound like a Google apologist.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   I don't know.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.040]   I feel like I'm supposed to do like, oh, the cloud isn't ready now.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.000]   I'm supposed to, you know, say that we should all be paranoid about putting our stuff in
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.520]   the cloud because this kind of outage is just, you know, an example of like the horrible
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   things that could happen.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.640]   It was a hundred minutes without our email.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.280]   I map and pop was working.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.600]   I just didn't think it was that big a deal that might make me a bad, a bad blogger.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.920]   Well, you had an alternate email.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.600]   I guess if you didn't have an alternate email losing your email account, even for a couple
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.320]   of hours in the middle of a work day, could be, you know, something significant.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   I mean, it's a little painful.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.040]   I mean, I think this kind of points to a bigger issue about how important sinking your
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   stuff is, right?
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.640]   So like, I map, even if you had synced via I map and I map was down, you'd still have,
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.360]   you know, some of your mail in your client, sinking your address book.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.400]   I mean, I have my editor's email address on my local computer.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.360]   I can email her from an alternative address.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.000]   You could set up, you know, an alternative address and another service, you know, instantaneously.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.880]   I didn't, I just didn't think it was that big a deal.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.520]   I think it's kind of important to have different ways that you, you know, I'm a big fan and
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.920]   we've talked about this before about sinking and kind of redundancy and having, you know,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.000]   a local copy that, as well as the copy in the cloud for, for times like this or when
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.400]   you're on the airplane or whatever.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.920]   Would it be possible to have some sort of failover system?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   No, I don't, I don't, I use Gmail, but, but another other systems, but my main address
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.520]   is through a server of mine.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   So it's Leo at Leoville.com, not Leo@gmail.com.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   Right.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.560]   Couldn't you create some sort of thing that if I'm getting mail bounced that, then it
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.600]   fails over to another system, something like that, that might be a good thing to have.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.240]   This is why I'm such a big fan of Google Apps, which is what I use for my main email address
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.800]   is that it lets you associate your domain name, which you control to the Google services,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   right?
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.600]   You know, my email, Gina, jina, japani.org, if Google Apps goes down or I get locked out
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.040]   of my account, which by the way, that's the thing that I'm worried about.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   I get locked out of my account.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   That's much more serious.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   That's much more serious.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.720]   All I have to do is change my, you know, MX server, whatever the email setting is to
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   say, you know, use this service instead.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.840]   You know, and I, and I take my address with me.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   I'm not, you know, tied to my@gmail.com address.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.400]   So I think, I mean, that's why I, you know, that's why I love Google Apps is because
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.680]   you, you know, you have a domain name, which is separate from Google, which you can, you
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.400]   know, control and you can point to another place, just like owning your own website domain
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.600]   name and saying, you know, this hosting provider sucks.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.080]   I'm going someplace else and you can do that.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.440]   But you'd have to have, you have access to your MX record.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.680]   I mean, there'd have to be some, you'd have to have some sophistication.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.240]   Well, this is true.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.960]   So I've always wondered how you do this because my Google Apps account is tied to my Gmail
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.040]   account, but you could tie it.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   You can you, how do you get it to tie to a different account?
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.920]   Can you tie it to multiple accounts?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.080]   You can, so you can set up a Google Apps account for a particular domain.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.960]   It used to be called Google Apps for your domain.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   They changed the name.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.680]   I think it's just Google Apps now.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.080]   And then you can forward other email address, email addresses to it.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.440]   So you have to have a domain like smartersmarterwhere.org.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   Right.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.680]   And you could tell, and do you have to pay for that?
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.600]   Is that a more professional version of Google Apps or?
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.760]   No, no, there's a free version.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   I'm using a free version.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   I didn't pay Google.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.000]   I mean, I'm paying obviously my, you know, my domain name, you know, registrar.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.480]   You'd have to pay for it smarter where, obviously.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   Right.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   I have to pay for the domain name, right?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.680]   But I could just tell it to use Google Apps and it's, and there is a free version.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.240]   But you can associate with the domain name.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.800]   We're trying to decide in the office because our accountant uses Excel and she's complaining
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.000]   that the Google spreadsheet is too slow to do a lot of data entry.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   She wants to use Excel.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.560]   We're trying to figure out, I guess I have to use Microsoft SharePoint.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.280]   We're having, trying to figure out a way that we could share that Excel spreadsheet.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.080]   I guess that's really, that's, that's where, you know, Google doesn't have those desktop
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.680]   apps that are faster that you could work with and then share.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   Right.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   Right.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   Right.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.680]   It's not your time to the cloud apps.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   Right.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   Right.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680]   Right.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680]   So like Dropbox, I think offers, you know, a syncing service, right?
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.680]   So you can work on a, a file on it.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680]   Oh, we can use Dropbox.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   That's a good idea.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   That's, that's an idea.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.680]   I have friends who swear by it already.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.480]   Clay Shurkey said it's changed his life.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   Dropbox?
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.360]   I mean, having a, just a little tablet now or not, I mean a little notebook and Dropbox.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.240]   And he's, you know, he's a Mac fan more like us.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.840]   We use, we use get Dropbox, we have a 50 gig Dropbox that we use to transfer audio files
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   around.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.940]   And it has been great.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:06.240]   The neat thing about Dropbox is you, you, it works Mac and Windows.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.680]   You, as you said, it's kind of like I disk in the sense that you can have the same Dropbox
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.120]   on all the computers, right?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.120]   Right.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   Right.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.600]   So I have a local Dropbox on this machine.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.400]   She has a local Dropbox on that machine.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.760]   I could share one folder with Clay.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.720]   So he could have it on his machine.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.200]   And then, and then if I change any, if anybody changes a folder, it gets changed on every
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   machine.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Is that right?
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   I think so.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   I do need a complex.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.080]   But, but that would follow the Gina rule that you're synced to a machine as well.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.120]   And so you have a safety if that's the way it works.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120]   Well, and you do.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.680]   You have, you actually have many copies of the file.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.400]   There's, there's issues of locking and so forth.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   But if you could just say, don't, nobody touched this.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   I'm using it.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   Right.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   Right.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.880]   Everybody calculated the downtime percentage for Gmail over a year.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.800]   99.9998.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.920]   I mean, it's not often are they down?
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920]   Is this a common occurrence?
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.840]   I mean, it's happened a few times, but it's always pretty short.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.520]   I mean, I, you know, I was, I visited the Gmail team at the Google campus.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.080]   They literally, they have like a siren in the middle of the workspace, like amongst
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   all the computers.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.080]   Go, go, go.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.080]   That starts.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   That goes crazy.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   Like the minute that there are problems, they're constantly monitoring.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.000]   I mean, you know, you get this kind of insight, you know, just having that kind of access,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.840]   but it's like, you know, they knew about it right away.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   They're going to learn from this.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.280]   Ah, you know, I don't know.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.640]   Again, I feel, I feel a little weird.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.680]   I don't want to sound like an apologist, but it's like it wasn't down that long.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   They knew about it.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.680]   They took care of it.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.480]   You know, it's better than the involved.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.280]   Isn't it nice to have that benchmark?
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.480]   Everything's better than Twitter or in its day, of course, blogger itself.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   Right.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   Blogger.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   It was down in the early days.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   It was down constantly.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   Ever as is a master of the fail-wailing.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   It is.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.240]   Ben Trainor, who is his title is VP Engineering and Site Reliability Tsar at Google posted
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.840]   on the Gmail blog.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.400]   Sounds like Matt cuts.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400]   Yep.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.160]   I will get Matt cuts on the line in just a second.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.080]   That ding was Matt saying, okay, I'll be on the show.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.000]   I told him you were hurt that he didn't follow you.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.720]   No, but then no, that's not true.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   You don't have to follow me.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   I won't be hurt.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.360]   I don't take this stuff personally.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.760]   Anybody watching, if you don't follow Leo, I'm telling you to follow me.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.840]   Yeah, you got to follow me and break my heart.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   You don't want to break an old man's heart.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.320]   I'm trying.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.240]   So as we get Matt cuts on the line, let me just, the story, it's kind of interesting.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:38.000]   Apparently they were putting in new servers.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.920]   He says, this morning we took out a small fraction of Google's servers offline to perform
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   routine upgrades.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   Okay, they were upgrading.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.600]   While this itself isn't a problem, we do this all the time.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.120]   And Gmail's web interface runs in many locations and just sends traffic to other locations when
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120]   it's offline.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   But that's what happened.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   There was a cascade.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.760]   It's kind of like when power plants go down and servers got overwhelmed, shut down completely.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.520]   One after another, he says a few of the request routers became overloaded and in effect told
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.600]   the rest of the system, stop sending us traffic.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.200]   We're too slow transferring the load to remaining routers, which then became overloaded.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.080]   And eventually the whole thing was just dead in the water.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.240]   And you know, if it weren't for real time systems like Twitter, it might not have been
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.200]   such a big deal, huh?
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.320]   The fact that people could Twitter about it's kind of what makes such a big deal out of it.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.640]   But it's interesting too that Twitter becomes a backup for Google.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.080]   In that case, you did have another alternative means to talk to people.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.040]   You could tweet, I have no mail.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.620]   Well, it becomes, you know.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.160]   That was, that was, that was, that was, it was saying like, I'm not going to say, I'm
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   not enough.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.840]   I know Gu Gu G-Man was down.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   Stop.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.040]   That's all I'm seeing.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.240]   It becomes like down for everyone, but just me.com.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.640]   It's just people saying like, hey, is this happening for other people too?
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.880]   We're all sharing this common experience of fail.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.780]   But you know what's it?
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:04.080]   What is interesting that I, that I do notice, you know, I think it was John Belmont, great
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   AP radio guy.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.160]   I've known him for years used to be at, was it NBC or CBS or radio news?
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   Really great.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.000]   Great voices of radio.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Said think back.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.160]   What, you know, for people, our age, Jeff, how did you find out that Kennedy was assassinated
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.200]   or Martin Luther King was assassinated?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.120]   How did you learn, you know, these events, you heard it on the radio.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.160]   Nowadays, we learn everything on, on these real time servers, mostly Twitter, right?
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.560]   Well, and what was fascinating to Michael Jackson death is that an AP reporter called
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.880]   me and she said someone came on her bus and said, Michael Jackson just died.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.600]   And that woman was then a node in a network.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.840]   And all those people became nodes in networks.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:52.160]   And when people talk about, I heard a podcast this morning, which one was, so I was all
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.600]   in the media.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:00.000]   And Ethan Zuckerman at Harvard, who is brilliant and great, was kind of complaining that the
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.040]   Twitter revolution in Iran wasn't as big as we think as not as many people used it.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.360]   And that's true.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.040]   But if you have enough nodes who then talk to networks, it doesn't matter how many they
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.840]   get amplified, right?
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.920]   It gets spread on faster.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.880]   The more nodes you have, the faster it's going to spread clearly.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.320]   But that's what you need is nodes and networks.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   I think we got Mac Cuts.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.560]   I think we have Mac Cuts on the line.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.760]   No matter you there, I think I'm here.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.960]   Yes, we hear you great.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.760]   You don't have a camera by any chance.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   Do you?
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.360]   There's a funny story behind that.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.840]   I'm a PC guy and I tried to hijack my wife's apple to get the webcam, but I haven't figured
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.040]   that out on the fly.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.600]   So maybe for next time.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.200]   We'll accept you without a picture.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:48.400]   It's because you're so devastatingly good looking that the rest of us would just pale.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   You're a two kind.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.920]   Hey, it's great to talk to you.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   I've never met.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   We've never met.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.280]   Of course, I follow you on Twitter, unlike you.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.240]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.480]   And I read your blog religiously.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.480]   What is the great things about you, Matt, is that, and really I think it speaks to one
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.720]   of the great things about Twitter, is the transparency.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.480]   I mean, we really, and the fact that you could even come on the show on the drop of a hat,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.680]   most corporations just wouldn't allow that.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   Google apparently lets you talk.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.240]   Well, and the nice thing is that I've made plenty of mistakes in communicating for Google.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.040]   But most of them I was early on enough that people didn't really pay much attention to
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   Google.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.880]   So now I know not to do at least a few stupid things.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.960]   What's your official job?
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   It's not blogger.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   Sure.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.040]   It's ahead of the WebSpam team at Google.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.720]   So in fact, I was spam fighting on, you know, herbal Viagra stuff and then saw the opportunity
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   to hop on the show.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.360]   Well, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.480]   So since you work on the Gmail team, you must have some insight under this outage.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.560]   What was it like at Google when this happened?
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.040]   Well, and I work in the search quality team.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   So I work on WebSpam.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   That's spam, not the old spam.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.360]   But certainly, you know, we were affected by it as well.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.760]   And we used Gmail and Google Apps for our domain for internal stuff.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.440]   So you know, we feel the pain just like anybody else does.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.000]   And so a lot of people were rooting to get that back up as quickly as possible.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Did you hear the alarm across the campus?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.560]   You know, what happened instead is everybody was out in the hallway chatting with each other
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.480]   because we didn't have the email.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   It's like a fire drill.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480]   Exactly.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.160]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.640]   That could happen once in a while and be probably a good thing.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.120]   Get people together.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   Totally.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.680]   So the cascading failure, which is very much like what happens in a power outage where
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.240]   one by one, these power plants get overloaded and then shut down.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.920]   One by one, these routers got overloaded and shut down.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.080]   It's amazing that it took so long to get it back up.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.000]   I imagine some of that time was just checking database consistency, things like that, kind
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.560]   of making sure that, you know, when they did go back up, everything was working properly.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.880]   Well, it's certainly one of the worst things you can do whenever something goes wrong is
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.080]   to panic and sometimes that can make things worse.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.680]   So it's almost better to take your time and make sure you recover correctly than to just
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.560]   sort of make new mistakes whenever you're trying to come back from it.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.560]   Right.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.440]   But I think in a way, it speaks to the success of Google that this 100 minute outage, which
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.960]   for Twitter would be just, you know, a day in the life, is a huge story.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.920]   And then people freak out and say, well, can we trust the cloud?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.560]   Is, oh my God, you know, maybe we're putting too much trust in the cloud.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.520]   Well, I think you and Gina both made great points, which is that, you know, if you use
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.480]   Google Apps or whatever, then you can just switch your MX record away.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   I love that.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.640]   We don't want to lock you data in.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.200]   You can always, if you don't like Google, you can go somewhere else to get better service.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.400]   Kevin Kelleher writing on giga-ohm said the five things we learned from the Gmail outage,
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.360]   one get used to outages.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.560]   Scale forces history to repeat as the internet matures, we expect it to operate more smoothly.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.160]   But in fact, this is what happens.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.480]   This is how things scale.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.040]   Companies get better.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.200]   They learn to avoid outages.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.280]   But as the things grow, new things, new problems occur.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:19.560]   In fact, in this case, according to Ben Trainor's blog posts, Google has expanding capacity.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   They have more peak capacity.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:31.560]   They're telling the routers degrade gracefully instead of just throwing up your hands and
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   saying, "I can't work here."
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.560]   So I imagine that this will be handled.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   And he says to answer your question, Google is still more than 99.9% availability, which
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   is pretty darn good.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   What else is life?
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.560]   Not to be a Google fan, but what else in life is up constantly?
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   How nor is my cable operation going down.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.400]   My phone comes down.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.320]   The train goes down.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.400]   It's hard to think what stays up constantly.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   Right.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.120]   And who's better equipped to deal with it?
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.480]   I mean, every company is going to have services that goes down.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.440]   At this point, Google has to scale to deal with it.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.800]   Probably the best of all of them.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   How long have you been...
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   Go ahead.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   Dr. Rosen novel a few novels ago.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   I can't remember the name of a dammit.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.400]   There was a massive data failure, but there was one engineer in Google who kept data alive
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.800]   longer than anyone else.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.080]   That was a great short story that he wrote.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.360]   It was like the end of the world.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.280]   They're all trapped in a big building.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.960]   But Google was still working.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   That's a great story.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   I don't think...
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.960]   Is that recent?
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   I don't know if I think that was pretty old.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   Anyway, I'd see if I could find that.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   You're right.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   It is pretty old.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   That's right.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   It's really one.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   You're right.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   It's a great story.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   I just love that story.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.280]   The topic crisis, you can't control how you respond.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   Gmail may have caused some companies to think twice about paying Google for its apps, which
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   include Gmail.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.800]   But when all is said and done, Google swift, forthright reaction to a PR nightmare when
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   it prays.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.280]   I think that's true.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.800]   In a way, the company's response outweighed the bad publicity of the adage itself.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.600]   And I'd say now five days later, that's absolutely true.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.000]   I don't see a lot of blowback from this at all.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.920]   Well, and one thing that I really appreciated was I've seen other outages in the past where
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.680]   it took Google a long time to acknowledge or to respond or even do a post mortem.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.360]   And this time, there was Jeff Huber, who's a VP of engineering at Google and an all-round
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.440]   great guy.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.600]   And he was tweeting right in the middle of it just to let people know, "Okay, it's back
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   up."
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.320]   And the fact that they got the post mortem to let people know exactly what happened so
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.560]   they feel a little more confident that we know what was going on live the same day.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   I think that's a big step forward.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.240]   Ben's blog post was really fantastic.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.520]   I did a radio interview on coast to coast that night because everybody was a big enough
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.720]   story that major media outlets are covering it.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.800]   And I was able to say, "Well, here's what happened according to Google that night and
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.040]   say, 'Here's what they're doing about it.'"
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.960]   And I think that there's a lot to dampen down the panic.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.480]   It is a great lesson to be learned.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.040]   Yeah, I thought the communication was actually quite very fast, better than I'd ever seen
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   before.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.920]   People love that Google could say, "Okay, the web interface is down, but IMAP works."
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.640]   Yes, pop and I'm not continuing to work.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.560]   Yeah, pop and I'm not continuing to work.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.880]   When IMAP launched, I was like, "Why?"
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.920]   I mean, obviously Google wants eyeballs to be looking at the web interface.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.360]   They want you to look at the web interface.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   They don't want you to...
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   Right.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360]   You're not seeing any ads in IMAP.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   Right.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   You're not seeing any ads, right?
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.600]   So they don't really want you to use IMAP, but it's there.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   They launched it.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   You can use it.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   It was kind of awesome.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.000]   When it did launch, I was like, "Great, I'm going to use a desktop client forever.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.840]   The web interface is never going to be good enough, but it is now good enough that it
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.640]   is my preferred way to get it."
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.440]   But even when it went down, it was like, "Okay, you can still get your mail and here are the
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   settings to set it up."
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.120]   Now, granted, you had to start digging around in your service settings and whatever, but
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   you could do it.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.680]   Actually, that's what I wound up doing to get my invoices and my copy in.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.040]   I was like, "Oh, yeah, I have IMAP set up and I had my mail."
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.520]   So it was kind of awesome to have that kind of fallback, which Google offers just to increase
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.080]   the addictions, the product.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.280]   I'm not showing you ads through that.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:13.400]   Also in the GigaOM article by Kevin Kelleher, item three, "Big is bad for Google users.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.200]   G email has become a crucial part of many workdays, but many people had no problem finding
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.760]   alternatives such as Twitter to the point that Twitter itself felt the strain.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   I didn't know that.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:28.200]   Google goes down and what is the joke?
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.600]   Google gets a call of the fluid everywhere else, because the cold recipes first.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   Exactly.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   So Twitter coughs.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.320]   It reminded me why I would hate for Google to buy Twitter or Facebook and other communication
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   channels.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   That's really true.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.320]   You don't want a single point of failure.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.720]   Diversity is really important, not just in ecosystems, but on the internet too.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.840]   It's really nice to have these other alternatives.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:55.320]   That's why I hate it that the friend feed got sold to Facebook, frankly.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.840]   Email is finally a utility.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   Email downtime is not a life or death matter as a power outage can.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.320]   But still, we have come to expect 99.9% uptime.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320]   This main theme is because...
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.560]   Yeah, that isn't a coming of age of email in a way.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.600]   Goodness knows, the corporate email goes out all the time.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:18.600]   Well, I think there was a really good takeaway just from the fact that as engineers, you
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.160]   should always ask yourself, "When you have an outage, how do you fix it next time?"
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.000]   So the fact that we had an apps dashboard is actually because of a previous outage.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.400]   We said, "You know what?
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.640]   We need to have a way where people can know what's going on."
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.960]   And so this time, when we did have an outage, there was an apps dashboard.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.560]   And hopefully, you just keep iterating and find new ways to make it a little bit better.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.200]   And then people say, "Yeah, email can be a utility because it's up or I have ways to
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.960]   know what's going on most of the time."
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.200]   Google.com/appsstatus.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.400]   And that's exactly where I went right away.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.960]   And you can see that you saw red X next to Gmail, and you could click on it and you could
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   see what was going on.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   And that really is a nice feature.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.400]   Although, I did poke a little fun at some of the copy that showed up on the app status
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   page.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.280]   And it was actually wasn't the first when the down-edge happened, the longer outage
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   happened.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.520]   It was the day before, I guess there was a really short outage.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.760]   And the copy said something like, "This will be fixed in the near future.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.360]   Note that this is an estimate."
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   [laughter]
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.560]   Please don't believe this.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.760]   You know, when engineers write copy, this will be fixed in the near future.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   But please note, that's an estimate.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.000]   That's why I like engineers.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.520]   They don't mess around, no marketing speak.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   We don't know.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.000]   We have no idea what's going on here.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.840]   We're doing our best.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.560]   We're going to give you a guesstimate.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.800]   This is probably when it's going to be fixed.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   I think that's great.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   Yeah, I noticed that too.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.240]   I thought that was very funny.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.400]   And what's really interesting is they keep that information on.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   You can go back.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   It's still there.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.720]   You can go back and see what happened.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   I was surprised because you tweeted, "Oh, this week in Google is coming up, getting
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.600]   ready to listen to it."
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.440]   Why would you somebody who works at Google listen to this show?
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.040]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.240]   We live, breathe, and sleep search in Google.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   We think about how to make it better all the time.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.880]   I'm spending the sunny California day catching up on email and everything.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.360]   Last weekend, I was driving up to Fucamp.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.280]   I had three or four hours to burn.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.160]   I ended up listening to every single episode of Twig.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   It was just fantastic.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   [laughter]
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   That was awesome.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.160]   You're not.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.200]   I guess anything better than dealing with spam, I'm out.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.640]   Well, no, it was, I mean, compared to the radio, man, it's, you know, Mary Hodder and
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.360]   Anil Dash and Kevin, you guys had really good people rotating in and just fun stuff.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.680]   So it was great to listen to.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.160]   Yeah, I'm really pleased with how this show has come out and I really give credit to Gina
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.800]   and Jeff.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   And you're right.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.960]   We've had some really great fourth hands, fourth people in our bridge hand and you're
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   the latest, Matt.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.040]   So thank you and welcome to the show.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.600]   So Matt, I've been wondering, what are they asking for ages?
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.120]   Does dealing with spam all the time affect your worldview and your faith in mankind?
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   It does.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.360]   You get a little bit jaded and the bad thing is that once you learn how to see spam, you
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.800]   see it everywhere including in conventional media.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.720]   But the bright side is that it changes your perspective and you try not to, you know,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.120]   you think about how to make the world a better place.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.560]   So that, you know, there's pros and cons, I guess.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.560]   Matt, I'm happy.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:25.200]   Matt, I've always been impressed at how gracefully you handle all the web publishers who practically
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.800]   tackle you at every conference to ask you, you know, how do I get my blog or my site
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.560]   to show up higher and search results?
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.200]   And you're always just so, you always have such great advice and, you know, you know,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.680]   real SEO advice, none of this like BS stuff and you've always been so helpful.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.880]   So I've always been impressed with that because they know you've, you kind of hold the keys
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.240]   to not hold the keys to page rank, but you have, you know, insight in those things.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.640]   Yeah, well, thank you.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.520]   It's funny because I literally was, someone had emailed and their MySpace layout page
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.080]   wasn't ranking where they wanted it.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.480]   And I had to sort of softly break the news to him that all those ringtones and a side
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.960]   very review that they had on their site could be a little bit.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.080]   That's another way you've improved mankind, Matt.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   Yes, thank you.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.400]   Well, it's a lot more fun to be on Twig.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.160]   So thanks for having me on.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:19.720]   Tone down the ringtones on your MySpace account.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   Well, we're glad you're--
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.760]   Slowly, I saw this week that one of the links on our list is that Google News put out a
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.840]   video explaining to publishers how to improve their lot there, including best practices,
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.640]   explaining how things are ranked and so on, which I thought was a new transparency from
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   Google News.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.600]   Well, and I just was reading earlier today, your post, you know, Google Bigotree was the
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.960]   title, which is fantastic.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:51.080]   And I think that video is a good first step because we really do want to show the number
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.920]   one best source if there's someone that is providing value add or original research or
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.520]   is the expert as a news source compared to just reprinting some wire copy without adding
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.520]   any insight.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.000]   We definitely want to highlight, you know, the original source or the source that is--the
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.760]   publication that is adding some value.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.240]   So I think that video is a good first step, but we can definitely do more to talk about
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   that.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.400]   Let me quote a little bit from Jeff's post because it really is actually a good starting
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.800]   point for a conversation.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.440]   Google has an image problem, not a PR problem.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.520]   That is, it's not a problem with the public, but a press problem with whining old media
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   people.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.840]   Jeff's an expert on them.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.960]   I'm an old media person, but I try not to whine.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.480]   Never whine, but he knows a few that do.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   Google is trying hard, too hard perhaps, not to argue with the guys who still buy ink by
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   the barrel.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.080]   Google is only causing them to buy fewer barrels.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.880]   And newspaper people will use their last drops of ink to complain about Google's success
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.840]   and to blame it, unfortunately for their own failures rather than changing their own
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   business.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.360]   What should Google do?
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.480]   You hear it all the time from everybody from the AP on down.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.600]   You know, Google News is killing our business.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.160]   Well, I got fed up because I got another French reporter.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.160]   It's something about the French.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.080]   I have a thing about Google.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.400]   And the reporter came in and the presumption of the piece was that there was a rising tide
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.840]   of discontent with Google and that people were going to get mad at Google and go running
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.160]   to Bing as a result as if we've got choice that way.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   Well, it's the French.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   It's the French.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.600]   Yeah, all gonna use Bing.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.800]   I got another one like this during the week from an Israeli reporter who wanted to deal
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   with Google's failures.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   You know, it's fine.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.200]   I criticized Google in my book for a few pages and there are things to criticize Google about.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.120]   But this media presumption that I see again and again, I saw it this week with the New
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.160]   York Times and the Internet in general, a story that said that this rumor about Chelsea
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.240]   Clinton's wedding was passed around because of an Internet media culture and then the story
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.280]   proceeded to do nothing but quote newspapers, no Internet.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.040]   So there's this media presumption that the Internet is bad, Twitter, Google, Facebook,
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.280]   all these things are leading to our ruination and reporters who start with that basis and
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   their stories.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.160]   I just kind of had it and wanted to complain about it.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.880]   But at the same time, I think that just trying to be constructive about it, what should Google
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.160]   do part of the proximity to the title of a certain book?
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   A fine book, yes.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.320]   Thank you very much.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.480]   And I think that Google has to do more to prove and demonstrate that it is a friend of
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.520]   news, not newspapers, but news.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:31.440]   It has so much power to be able to, as Matt said, send links to journalism at its source
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.240]   to provide tools and platforms and revenue and R&D and things like Wave, which we've
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.000]   talked about at NOSM here.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.080]   And so I think Google has to have a different relationship with news because right now it's
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.360]   getting hammered by these whiny old news people.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.200]   Well, not just the newspaper people, the book publishers too.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.080]   And there's now, of course, a fight over this book settlement.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:33:00.920]   Google had a press conference on Thursday calling for the press to support Google in
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.840]   the benefits of the settlement.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.720]   We've complained a little bit about the settlement because there's this notion that it's a public
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.080]   domain book if nobody asserts the rights to it.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:18.080]   Is that where the debate is all about, Jeff, who owns these books that are still technically
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.600]   in copyright?
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.200]   I think that's most of it, but Steve Avadnathian, who will have on, I think, in a future show,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.080]   is a far better spokesman for the problems with Google Book Search.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.200]   My argument about the Google Book Search, and he and I don't disagree about this, is
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.760]   that the book industry could have done everything on their own long ago.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   And in so many areas, whether it's serving advertisers differently or book search, Google
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.640]   just filled a vacuum, a vacuum that other industries could have filled before it.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:50.040]   The authors' guild accuses them, essentially, of dumping, of price fixing, as they said,
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:55.480]   well, actually, this is Amazon, but it's the same, let me get this right.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.840]   The authors' guild is settling with Google, I'm sorry.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.560]   They are attacking Amazon for dumping books at below cost.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   That now, yeah.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.120]   But then I saw that argument in my comments on my blog post today from, I think it was
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   Daniel Tuckling who said that free is an issue now in terms of dumping, but in a Chris
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.440]   Anderson free world, we can't accuse every opportunity to give away something for free
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   as dumping.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.960]   It's just the Internet economy.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   Some stuff's free.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:33.280]   And if that gets stopped because people want to protect old industries from the benefits,
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.480]   the Internet dividend, well, then we're in big trouble.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:40.000]   It's interesting that the authors' guild likes this settlement because, of course, they
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   were the people who were really--
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   They negotiated.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.440]   They negotiated this settlement.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.200]   They say it's a way to make millions of out-of-print books available again, which is what everybody
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.320]   thought was the benefit of this initiative.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.080]   And they're saying, look, Google's not going to get exclusive rights to these books because
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.760]   of the agreement.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.640]   Now there's a scan of this book and there's a digital copy of this book, but Google doesn't
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.040]   assert that we are the only people who can use it and own it.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.880]   And they say that's going to open a market for these new books.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.720]   Now, it is going to go to court.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:20.640]   Denny Chin on October 7, which is a month and two days from now, will preside over a fairness
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.560]   hearing over this-- and maybe a healing.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.240]   We can only hope it's a healing.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   Hands on.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.760]   Between Google and US publishers and authors, he's a guy who presided over a Bernie Madoff's
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.840]   trial, interestingly enough.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.480]   Because Chin is reading right now all of these submissions, all of these complaints, all
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.880]   these briefs.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.160]   Do you think there's a chance that he may reject this settlement?
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.880]   I'm not an expert at this at all.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   We'll get C-Von.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   We've got to get C-Von.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.920]   There's a lot of complaint about it.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.760]   There's also a lot of support for it.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.000]   And it's a very complicated issue.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.800]   For books going forward, they're digital.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.640]   I mean, my book is online, but not searchable by Google, which I kind of don't like.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.040]   But yours would not be one of the books scanned.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   Exactly.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:16.360]   So we're talking about books from some date prior and what happens to them from the beginning
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.080]   of their copyright life until today if they're not digital.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.920]   And that's where the issue really lies.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.840]   Things beyond that, it's up to you whether or not to put it up and make it searchable
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.400]   or do it, don't follow.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   Right.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.640]   The settlement described as the biggest copyright licensing deal in history was hammered out
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.080]   after American publishers and authors objected to Google's scanning of books without permission.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.120]   So Google paid $125 million into a fund.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.640]   And publishers and authors can register works, receive compensation from digital book sales
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.920]   or institutional subscriptions.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.480]   Authors and publishers would get a 70% royalty.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.880]   Google keeps the rest.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.120]   Same, by the way, percentage at Apple keeps of the iTunes music sales.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:03.640]   Google says it's going to scan 32 million in print and out of print books.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.680]   Wow.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.800]   That's an amazing part of the fear is that no one else could have the resource goes this
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:17.160]   argument to do that and so to put Google in, you know, a driver's seat there.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:23.680]   But again, I don't necessarily agree if every library in the US chose to scan 10 books,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.880]   if they could get their act together, if the book industry could get us act together
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.080]   and scan their own books and put them up, no, Google wouldn't necessarily do it all.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.440]   And they're making it, I think, rather a gift to readers and to knowledge.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.480]   I mean, it's the best possible, I mean, you could say, well, if Google's the only people
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.880]   who have the resources to do this, then nobody does it, then we don't get it.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.840]   So at least we get this and then we're trying to hammer out a way to make it fair.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.000]   And I think this seems close.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.120]   Amazon is really the, I think is one of its chief fleet complaining because they want to
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.680]   have an ebook business in which they sell books.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.600]   And they're saying that this is price fixing and violates antitrust law.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.680]   In a sense, Google will have a monopoly.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.960]   Well, I think a lot of people kind of missed the fact that there is a lot of really interesting
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.800]   good stuff that happens.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.960]   You know, this is not my area as much, but I think on the Google Books blog, they just
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.160]   mentioned that they released a million books in public domain, open formats.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.160]   So you know, that's fantastic.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.600]   That's something that a lot of people can benefit from.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.120]   Well, and this is why Amazon hates it.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.480]   Because what is the first thing Sony says when they release their new ebook readers?
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.720]   We've got more books than Amazon because they have this, this ePub library from Google,
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.000]   a million books.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.320]   So it is in a way, I could see Amazon saying, well, this is bad for business.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.120]   Sony can compete with us.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.280]   But the truth is Amazon is trying to preserve its monopoly.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.680]   You know, it's, it's lock on all of this stuff.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.800]   Amazon is the one that's dumping by charging under market rates for books and trying to
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   get us addicted to it.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.880]   And, you know, I still get the proper money for my book or when Audible, God bless them,
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.720]   gives away a book they still choose to pay.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.600]   It's not unfair to the author, but the argument is that it resets the prices for books.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.360]   Hey, the best test is the EU likes it.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:17.680]   If the EU likes anything, the US corporation does, I think we've got a good, a good, but
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   not the French.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.320]   But the French, well, that's okay.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.720]   That's their job.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.120]   I love the idea of having these, these books searchable.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   I don't even care if the full text is online in that sense, but the ability to search these
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   books and find out what's in them is great.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:40.280]   Well, if you haven't seen, there was a post from 2007 where you could take the content
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.400]   of books and look for things like cities that are mentioned.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.080]   And so I can send out the URL in a little while, but you can actually watch westward
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.200]   expansion across the United States over, you know, 1800s to 1890s.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.040]   And you can see that the cities that get mentioned spread to the west.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.440]   So you can do all sorts of interesting analysis like spot someone who plagiarized back in
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.600]   1900 and never got uncovered until now.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.960]   There's metadata in there.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:12.240]   You can do things like, you know, look at how language, you know, evolved over time, you
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.840]   know, the frequency of words.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.560]   You really can do some cool stuff.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.560]   That's interesting.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.560]   That's fantastic.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   I really, I love that idea.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   Let's see.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.760]   Any other stories we want to talk about?
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.320]   We had the Gmail outage, the book publishing deal.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.640]   And as we try to get Siva, who is a good friend of Jeff's on the show, but he will
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.240]   be on at a later date, of course, his labor day weekend.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   So a little difficult sometimes.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.360]   In fact, we're just glad Matt's stuck with all that spam.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.720]   Well, you got lots of stories here.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.680]   You got YouTube is going to be selling movies too.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.880]   I think that's a good one.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.240]   Yeah, that's a huge story.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:54.840]   So they're going to go compete against Apple and Amazon and Hulu in a sense.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.640]   What movies are they going to have the rights to?
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.800]   I don't know if it's known yet.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.880]   I think it's just reported negotiations, but I think it's an interesting way to try to
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:10.840]   make YouTube finally pay for itself and, you know, a bit of paid content there.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.160]   And what it says for us as consumers, I think, is we'll have lots of different places to
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   watch lots of entertainment.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.800]   We're really heading in that direction.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.320]   You know, I just got a, I mean, it's clearly this is the future.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.800]   I just got to Roku, which makes that great $99 box that you get Amazon and your Netflix
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   streaming.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.880]   Now is a deal with Major League Baseball for 20.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   This is amazing.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.640]   For $20 a season, you get every game.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.640]   And it's streamed.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   It's streamed in high def.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   It looks fantastic.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.560]   You can watch your local, you can watch any team and you can watch the local broadcasters
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.920]   or the away broadcasters.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.240]   You get your choice.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.640]   You can watch it later in the day.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   You can rewind it.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.520]   I mean, TVs and network televisions are trouble.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.920]   When these really valuable assets start moving to IP TV.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.600]   And of course, what they do is they disintermediate because now the money goes directly to Major
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:07.440]   League Baseball and not to NBC, ABC, CBS.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.760]   This is great for the, I think it's great for the end user.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   I love it.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.440]   Do you use a Roku box?
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.760]   I have a Tivo and I've been, I really enjoy watching web video on my regular TV.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.200]   So I download like, POGS, New York Times videos and Bitman's New York Times videos.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.120]   In fact, just last night there was an ad for a Dignation actually on my Tivo and I watched
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   like my first episode of Dignation.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.200]   So I was going to say to Leo, I want to see, I want to see Twitter on my Tivo.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   We're going to do it.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   We're going to do it.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   We're going to do it.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.120]   This show and all of our shows, since we make video anyway, we currently don't offer
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   it for download.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.320]   We actually are in the process of doing that.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.200]   And one of the things I didn't want to do was just be another iTunes download.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.400]   So the idea of getting this into somebody's remote control in their big screen TV is very
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.480]   a very attractive yet Tivo opened that up a couple of weeks ago.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.640]   Any producer, in fact, you can enter content directly if you want.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   Oh, really?
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   Interesting.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   Interesting.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.120]   Yeah, you can do any video URL I think.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.080]   The other thing that I do, you know, I'm a big fan of the Guild, just Felicia Day's
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.800]   web series and I fire up my Xbox 360.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.560]   I'm not much of a gamer, but I turn on the 360 just to download the latest episode every
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   week.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.000]   I look forward to it the way I would look forward to a new episode of 30 Rock.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.440]   So that kind of stuff makes you really wonder the mesh between network television and web
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.480]   video, it's happening.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.920]   You were talking about SEO earlier and how open Matt is about SEO.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.080]   It's not just Matt.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.840]   I saw this video on the Guardian site.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.760]   I think Jeff linked to it.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   A 15 minute video from Google on how they rank news stories.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.960]   And that's kind of transparency.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   You don't even get from newspapers frequently.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.880]   Well, and the funny thing is a lot of that we've been doing behind the scenes, even
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:51.160]   for years, trying to find the best source to show because if there's one store, you'd
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.520]   rather show either the outlet that broke it or the outlet that's closest or the outlet
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.200]   that knows the most about it or is this the most expert somehow.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.000]   So that video kind of exposes a lot of the hard work that Google is already doing to
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.160]   kind of send people to the best possible source or publication or publisher so that
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.960]   people can find out the highest quality information.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.160]   So I think it's good.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.320]   I think that's moderately new that part of it.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.400]   I think it's very, very important.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.600]   We have to say in the link economy, we've got to send links to journals, but it's source
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.560]   to support it because that's where it's going to be monetized.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:32.840]   The problem that Google News has in daylight for I'm a partner is that the natural reflex
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.760]   is to favor the latest, but the latest is often the AP rewrite of a story rather than
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.880]   the original reporting where it occurred.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.920]   And when AP rewrite stories, it cuts that link to the original journalism.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.080]   And so you want to try to suss out where was the original reporting being done, where is
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.600]   the value being presented, and then link to that.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.800]   So Google ranks newer articles higher, but does take into account a citation?
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.640]   That's what I found interesting is you're looking at the citations now to see if the
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.960]   LA Times breaks the story, the more people who quote the LA Times on that story, they're
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.160]   taking that.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.720]   I think there's also an opportunity in the closed world of news organizations to start
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.960]   some measure of metadata about original reporting.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.800]   It's very easy to see how that'll be spammed, and then there's a map to the rescue like
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.320]   a white blood cell.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:24.440]   I think in a small closed fraternity of news organizations, you could say abuse this and
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.560]   you're out, but use it wisely and you're going to get more value to the original reporting
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.560]   you do.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.200]   Well, and you see more willingness on the part of news organizations to do things like make
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.760]   these topic pages, which are sort of a living URL to talk about a story.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:45.520]   So you can get really fresh information, but you can also get a lot of background and context.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.080]   And that's also fantastic because then you have one URL that talks about the fires in
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.280]   Los Angeles that can persist for a while.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.480]   And so it's not as if this is an expendable URL that won't rank well the next week.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   Right.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.200]   So it was interesting Matt in the video, they said that they want to see an ongoing news
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.480]   story, not a permanent topic page for Google News.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.240]   However, at the same time, you have Marissa Meyer and Google saying that the article was
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.240]   basically outmoded.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.680]   And I've been arguing this in my blog as well, and then what you need is a one page home
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:24.560]   for a news story that is constantly updated so it can gain the Google juice over time.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.760]   And I think there's room for both.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   You know, stuff like Wikipedia, they'll have topic pages, the New York Times ends up having
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:35.120]   topic pages, but sometimes having like the exclusive breaking headline at the top of
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.560]   your title really makes a difference on getting users to click through as well.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.640]   The other thing Marissa talked about, I don't think I talked about on this show yet, is
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.880]   the, she, you know, I had all these mockers from news organizations out at the Aspen Institute
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.840]   when I was presenting CUNY's new business models for news project.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.000]   And just as they think they're getting their hands around the neck of the notion of having
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.720]   a website and a web page, she blows it all up and talks about hyper personal news streams
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.480]   and how we have to get our news insinuated into an individual's personal news stream.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   Uh oh.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.760]   Do newspapers, I mean, it's great that Google's giving them this SEO information.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.040]   Jeff, is it your experience that newspapers are listening to this?
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.080]   Newspapers are skits on this because on the one hand they want to blame Google and argue
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.680]   that it steals value and they don't understand the link economy.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.200]   On the other hand, they want every link they can get.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.080]   Do you understand it?
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   Really?
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.760]   I mean, they do understand it, except in France.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.680]   I'll stop the French news.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.800]   Do you have something against France?
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.200]   No, they just plain about things.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.600]   My book, not to plug the book, no publisher would buy the book because they all said that
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.720]   they wanted a diatribe against Google.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   Right.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.920]   When I blogged about that, one publisher came forward and took the book.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   Oh good.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.320]   It was that hard, really?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.120]   The market was saying, no, no, no.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.880]   There's no market for a book that says Google's doing it right.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.680]   There's a market for a book that says how awful Google is.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   Right.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.680]   Because that's the French presumption here.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.880]   When Josh Cohn of Google News goes over to France, he comes back every time with scars
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.800]   on his back as if he's been on True Blood.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.720]   How funny.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.680]   How funny.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:20.360]   So if you go to Google today, September 5th, you'll notice a little something strange about
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   the Google logo.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.960]   There's an alien abduction going on here.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.480]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.080]   There's a flying saucer stealing the "O" in Google.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.720]   I think it's really interesting what days Google chooses to commemorate.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:43.880]   In this case, for some reason, unexplained phenomenon is the source for that Google doodle.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.440]   And the funny thing is the very first story.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.160]   If you Google it is the mystery of Google's unexplained phenomenon doodle.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.600]   Matt, can you explain what's going on here?
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   What is that flying saucer?
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.080]   That was one of the more cryptic logos that I've seen.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.880]   I saw it lately last night and I said, "Okay, I have to drop an email to the webmasters
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.280]   and ask what's going on."
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.960]   A couple pieces of speculation that I've heard was there's an Exeter UFO Festival, September
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   5th.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.960]   Oh, that's obscure.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   It is.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.400]   But then I think the Voyager also launched on September 5th.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   So those are all the popular.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.920]   And I believe Google's commemorated Voyager in the past.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.720]   I seem to remember doodles for that.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.360]   Yeah, I think it might have.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.920]   Well, truthfully, I'm not 100% sure what the logo is intended for.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:35.740]   And Google tweeted this, 1.12.12.25.15, 21.18, 15.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.320]   A long number, they tweeted it.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   What's that?
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   Matt, you've got to know this.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.000]   And by the way, you do know this?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Yes.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.080]   It turns out it's just a simple code where A is 1 and B is 2 and C is 3.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.760]   So if you decode it, it works out to be something like, "All your O are belong to us."
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.600]   And she's all your faith.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.920]   I love the sense of fun.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   I have to say.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.560]   Yeah, the playfulness is really fun.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.840]   I just think that's great.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:08.880]   Well, and have you guys seen the Easter egg where you can search for recursion on Google?
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.480]   That's the best.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.720]   All right, let me try it.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.640]   So I Google recursion.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.640]   Yes.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.040]   All right, let me just see what we get when we Google.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.480]   We'll do this live, Google recursion.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.480]   Do you mean recursion?
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   Yeah, I mean recursion.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.480]   Do you mean recursion?
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   Yeah, I mean recursion.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.280]   Oh my God, that's hysterical.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   That's awesome.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   That is hysterical.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.480]   We have a geeky sense of humor.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.600]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.800]   So nobody really knows about this particular flying saucer, Doodle.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   Not yet.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.080]   Maybe more details will come out in a day or so.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.400]   Usually when you click it, you get something.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:50.960]   In this case, it's a recursive, another recursive response, which is the mystery of Google's
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.600]   unexplained phenomenon, Doodle.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.560]   Who has to approve that, Matt?
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.720]   Yeah, it does have to go through an approval process.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.600]   So it's not, I don't think it's a rogue webmaster or anything like that.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.360]   Is it Marissa who says yes or no to these or?
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.080]   I think that team reports up to her.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:11.160]   I don't know whether she approves every single Doodle by hand these days, but there's a Doodle
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.560]   team at Google.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:20.840]   You know, unfortunately, but not surprisingly, there's a lot of, can it even be controversy
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.840]   over these doodles?
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.440]   Your choice to honor some holidays, but not others.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.480]   And why do you have a flying saucer for this, but you don't have a Ramadan Doodle or whatever
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.120]   it is?
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.720]   So it's funny, you can't just have fun nowadays.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.120]   Did you also, the other one Marissa tweeted last week, if you Google ASCII art, take a
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.120]   look.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.120]   Do that one too.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   Oh, I love this.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:47.200]   I love it when engineers are, don't you love it when engineers are in charge, Gina?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.520]   Engineers should always be in charge.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.520]   They take over the world.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   Take a look at the logo.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.520]   The logo in the ASCII art is ASCII art.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.160]   Yeah, that's, yeah.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.000]   See, Saturday, Labor Day weekend, it doesn't get better than this.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   It doesn't.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.480]   This is what we do.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.680]   These are not holidays, weekends.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.080]   We look for strange Google search results.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.080]   I think it's hysterical.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.080]   I love that.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:14.780]   Matt, I wanted to ask you what the, kind of to change the subject a little bit, I was
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.160]   curious to know what kind of phone you use, what kind of phone operating system you use,
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.960]   and what the culture at Google is around Android.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.040]   I mean, is everyone walking around with an Android phone?
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:28.000]   Is it cool if you have an iPhone or I know, you know, at Microsoft there for a while,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   people couldn't have an iPod.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.600]   There's some rumors about that.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.440]   So I'm curious to know what that's like on campus.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   Absolutely.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.800]   It's funny because Google is pretty heavy towards Android and iPhone.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.680]   So for Christmas holiday last year, everybody got an Android phone.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.760]   And so you saw awful lot of Android phones around.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.120]   But people don't look at you, you know, sideways if you have an iPhone.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.000]   I have both and I kind of go back and forth on which one I use.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.440]   There's some really great programs like Listen just came out for Android, which is a great
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   podcasting client.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.280]   So you could, you know, download Twig and you can either stream it or download it and listen
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.520]   to it in your car later.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.120]   So it's, Android is really coming along.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   Yeah, it is.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   Well, it's nice to know you don't get the stink eye for using your iPhone.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.000]   What hand said did you get on that phone?
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.320]   It was a developer version of the G1, which is nice because it's unlocked.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.960]   So you can use the Android scripting environment, which lets you program Android with Python.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.640]   So you don't have to write hundreds of lines of Java code.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.400]   You can write like a proximity detector in 10 lines of code, which is really a lot of
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.400]   fun.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.440]   So there's a lot of people that tinker with Android for fun.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.440]   It's really cool.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.440]   Very cool.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   And yet the Google search app.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   Go ahead.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   Go ahead.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   I was just going to say the Google.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.440]   You can't get your mind off the shoot.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   Okay.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   One more time.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   You for it.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   All right.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   I'll start then you.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.360]   I was just saying that the Google search app on the iPhone is easily better than the one
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   on Android.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.800]   I mean, it's a really, it's the one with the voice activation and all that.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.600]   It just really works really, really well.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.720]   So obviously some Google engineers have iPhones.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   Yes.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.760]   And the voice recognition has gotten a lot better.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.160]   A lot of people sort of railed at it when it first came out.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:14.000]   But what we've done is by using voice recognition data over time, it's gotten remarkably better
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.080]   to the point where I've made a video and I'll post it at some point in the next few
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.000]   weeks where you can do like six or seven queries in a row and it will nail each query.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   No, I've noticed that.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.400]   And you're using data from Google Voice to improve that?
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.600]   I think we've said that we use Google 411 data.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.840]   I'm sorry, Google 411.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:39.480]   And then also I think the voice recognition app at Google mobile app itself will use.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.720]   So I think a lot of Googlers volunteered to help out and read a whole bunch of queries
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.920]   to help bootstrap it.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.480]   But then beyond that, you can use the data to help improve search quality.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.760]   Although I have to say, you know, with Google Voice, sometimes the, and it's a challenging
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.040]   environment because you're listening to voicemail messages.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.680]   But the transcriptions of some of the voicemail messages are quite humorous.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.240]   In fact, I think there's a meme on friend feed of comedic Google voice transcriptions.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.720]   They get kind of funny.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.560]   The cool thing though about the Google Voice app for Android is that the words and the
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.120]   transcript are a darker color.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.160]   The more sure Google is of them, which is really cool.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.840]   So when you play it, it's kind of like karaoke.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.120]   You know, like you can see the words kind of highlight as it plays.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.560]   But I wish there was a way for me to say like, no, this word is, you know, my name is
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.560]   Gina.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.560]   It's not Tina, that kind of thing.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   Right.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.680]   But maybe a future.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.440]   That could be your on your wish list.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.400]   It felt like the voice transcript, voicemail transcription in Google Voice right now is
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.200]   still sort of the 1.0 version.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.680]   But if history is any guide, it will probably get better over time.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.680]   So that's definitely something that would be nice.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.280]   Here's one from a Lindsay on friend feed, my funny Google voicemail transcription for
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   the day.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:56.920]   Quote, my name is comma Chuck and I am at the lots of Walmart branch over at gorgeous
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.520]   nipples and thank you very much.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.040]   You know, it never bothers me when I get transcriptions like that.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.880]   It's kind of almost a challenge to figure out what it was that they said.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.600]   And then you can always listen to the audio.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.600]   It's always fun.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.600]   I enjoy it.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.600]   I know.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.520]   It's like sometimes you get an unexpected laugh and I don't have to listen to my stupid
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   voicemail.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   I mean, that's the best part.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.760]   Like I don't have to listen to it unless it's really bad and then you do have to listen
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   to it.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   It's kind of funny.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.760]   Here's one.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   So Jeff, I'm sorry I interrupted you.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   Go ahead.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.360]   No, no, I was just going to say some Jake wanted one of those developer androids and
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.720]   I think you can buy them, can't you?
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.760]   But there's some limitation if you do.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.440]   Yeah, I think that it's pretty interesting.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.880]   They make the developer and droid available for last I checked it was $400 less price.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.400]   It might be lower now.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.040]   And the nice thing is that lets you control basically everything.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.040]   You can flash ROMs.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.400]   You can do almost everything that you want.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   As a consequence, they don't let you buy paid apps from the market because if you did and
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.520]   you have complete control of the handset then you could presumably pirate some binaries.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.160]   So that's the choice.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.160]   That's the trade off.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:13.640]   The other news is that Sprint announced it's using the HTC Hero.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.120]   I'm looking at that.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.880]   That looks like a nice handset.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   It does.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.880]   It has a headphone jack.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.680]   Have real headphone jack, hallelujah.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.080]   So would you go to Sprint Gina?
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   Yeah, I might.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   I would check it out.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:32.600]   Sprint's customer service is so awful and yet they have the best data of all.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   I think they're even better than Verizon for data.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.800]   I thought you could date it by the problem is if you can't use it in Europe.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.360]   It's not a CDMA.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.920]   They may, I don't know about the hero.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:47.800]   You can't it's possible to make Verizon sells them multi-band phones that do both.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   They have some world phones.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.200]   I don't know but no Sprint does that.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.520]   Who cares?
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.520]   Let's get it.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   Who cares?
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.280]   Let's see all of this.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   You're going to do it?
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   Are you going to do it?
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   I'll buy one.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   When's it come out?
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.040]   I'll at least go to the store and handle it.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.640]   It's like I suppose I'm daring you to.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:14.120]   I suppose yeah I suppose I should say something you know judicious like oh I should try it
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.920]   first but no I'm buying it.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   I don't care.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.640]   No, it's part of my job.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   I got it.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.640]   I got it.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   Let's see.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   I'm just seeing if I can find the release date.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.280]   Best Buy will offer it.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.480]   October 11, 1979.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   That soon.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.160]   All right.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.160]   I have a Sprint account.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.280]   I have a account on all the carriers just for.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.560]   What's your communications bill every month?
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   Oh you don't want to know.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.560]   I can't.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.560]   And does your wife kill you?
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.640]   No because it's my job.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.640]   It's a beautiful excuse.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.560]   I just you know I know honey I have to have all of them.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.000]   And the other end of the spectrum I unlocked my G1 so I could use my AT&T SIM whether because
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.480]   I was too cheap to pay the you know the contract termination fee so.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   I do feel guilty.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.560]   I mean my G1 is sitting behind me just you know I leave it on the charger just sits
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.560]   there.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.800]   There's a new now this is sad.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.280]   The next update firmware update will not be available for the G1.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.280]   Is that true?
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.080]   Is that been confirmed that don't have work on the G1?
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.080]   I do not.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   I don't think that's been confirmed.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:20.360]   I think what happened was someone tweeted and said we can't 100% promise that it will
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.760]   be supported and someone wrote that as donut won't be supported.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.960]   So I don't know what it is one way or the other but the only substance that I've seen
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.280]   the tweet said we can't guarantee which is completely different from it definitely won't
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.280]   work.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Stupidly I should never believe those tweets.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.240]   It sounded like a developer just really nervous.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:43.840]   I'm like oh how are we going to make this thing small enough to fit?
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.800]   Would that be the issues size you think?
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.040]   I think it would be.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:52.960]   Yeah I mean I haven't looked at it myself but some of these ROMs can get a little larger
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.640]   but certainly I'm sure there's people on Android trying to make sure that it does fit.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.880]   So I don't know the status one way or the other but.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.440]   You know cupcake was a huge upgrade.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.040]   It really made a big difference I think.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.000]   And usability.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Really liked that a lot.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.800]   Well I'm going to get a hero so what do I care?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:17.040]   Well the hero will be a donut phone or I love just saying donut.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.120]   Will it be a donut phone or will it be a cupcake?
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.080]   I don't know my guess would be donut.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.520]   But it seems like that would be the timing.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   Okay.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.520]   Oh this is so good to have Matt on.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.640]   We think of all the things I can ask him.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.840]   All the Google questions we've had for so long.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   I won't put you on this.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   I won't make you do that.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   I won't put you on the spot.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   Although.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.640]   Which cafeteria do you eat in Matt?
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.200]   43 most of the time.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200]   Building 43.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   Yeah baby.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   Probably.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   Which one is 43?
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.000]   What kind of food they have there?
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.520]   Well there's Andalei which is great burritos.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.360]   There's no name which is fresh food but Charlie's is one of the famous ones because they have
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.240]   so many stations you can just browse around and get a little bit of everything.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   So jealous.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.800]   I would be so fat if I were to Google.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.000]   Do you eat the green the green mark stuff Matt?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.840]   The good stuff or do you have sinus?
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.840]   No comment.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840]   No.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.400]   A lot of people joke that there is the Google 15 because there's so much good free food
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.640]   that you gain 15 pounds.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.760]   But the nice thing is they have a very nice workout gym as well.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.680]   So I've been maintaining.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.800]   I haven't been gaining too much weight.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.560]   I won't put you on the spot with the Google Apple voice thing.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:45.920]   Although Wired.com apparently is doing a sunshine request to get Google redacted its answer.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.400]   Oddly enough since Google was the victim in all this and Apple gave a lot of details.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.760]   Google said redacted.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.440]   So everybody's kind of curious what was it that they were redacted.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.400]   But I'm not going to put you on the spot for that one.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.440]   That's not something we should talk to.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   Matt.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.840]   It's not my area if I had to guess from the outside probably they were trying to respect
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.920]   whatever the replies from Apple were and not those without.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.040]   Which was very genteel frankly.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.840]   But I have no direct knowledge I'm afraid.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   All right.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.840]   Here's one.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.040]   When are we going to get invites on Google voice that we can send out to her?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   That's great.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040]   Wave or voice?
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   Wave.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040]   I want my wave invite.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.040]   Wave I want.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   I think that's coming soon isn't it?
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:38.040]   You want to write a friggin book?
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.640]   I got scared this week when I saw last week Adrian Hall of Adi who did every block said
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.840]   that it looked like Google wave was too complicated for him.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.840]   Oh yeah.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.840]   That's not a good sign.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.720]   I showed two people around Google wave this week with my test account and both of them
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.880]   like within the first five minutes were just like whoa.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880]   Whoa.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.880]   Whoa.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.880]   Good.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880]   Whoa.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880]   What is going on here?
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.480]   One of them was like can I please call you on the phones we can talk?
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   Oh boy.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.760]   But you know I think there's a little bit of a learning curve.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.280]   But wave is it's cool.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   It's really cool.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.440]   Well and some of it looks scary like the scroll bars look different but you know once
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.760]   you start to wait and it's not that much.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.280]   And what's also nice is when you have a lot of people you get that network effect where
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.440]   everybody's talking on a wave whereas if you just buy yourself.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   That's what I'm.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   There's no point really.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.880]   I'm not excited to have an invite until 100,000 people get their invites and then it'll be
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.880]   an interest.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.000]   So Gina you've had one for a while then.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.760]   I've had an invite for a while thanks to some good friends or someone I don't know an angel.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.800]   I'm not really sure actually how it happened but and yeah I've been playing around with
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.240]   it and you know you get an account it's for developers so you get an account and you
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.720]   get a test accounts that you can test bots that interact between two you know different
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.400]   accounts and I'm playing around with it and I've talked you know not a lot of my friends
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.240]   are on it because not a lot of people have invites so I haven't you know I haven't done
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.960]   you know I haven't spent a whole lot of time in there but I'm going to do I'm going to
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.400]   do a little talk of like a Q&A session at a local tech event here in San Diego this
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.240]   week so I showed a couple people around in it so that you know just a prep for that this
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.720]   week so so I like it I mean it's amazing it's looking a long ways to go I actually when I
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.600]   logged in this week it had been a few weeks since I had and I kind of expected to see
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.440]   maybe a little more a little more progress so you know I don't know it would be interesting
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.360]   to see they said later this year would be the launch I'll be impressed if that had
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.160]   happened I don't know I don't know if you know anything more about that Matt.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.880]   Well I think they've been setting themselves pretty aggressive goals partly as a forcing
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.840]   function to make sure that they do get out like you know for Google I/O they said well
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.960]   better to get it out there and start getting a lot of people trying it then then to hold
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.080]   on to it for too long and you know end up with something that looks really polished but the
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.960]   rest of the world can't use but going back to Google Voice for a minute Leo and Jeff if
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:00.920]   you guys don't have invites maybe you know direct message me a Gmail email address and
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.360]   I'll ask around and see whether we can do something.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.240]   But I just also for just in general because I mean this is such a great service and I
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.280]   was so happy as a longtime Grand Central user that voice came along because you've really
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.280]   improved it it's a wonderful service very useful but I just would like for instance I'd
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.560]   like everyone in my family to have a Google Voice number because I think it'll be the last
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.640]   number they'll ever have and so are they going to put invites on the page I guess is the question
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.720]   you know are you going to give users invites as they did with Gmail.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.240]   I know it worked really well with Gmail because they could control using the invites just how
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:38.080]   fast it grew so they could throttle you know according to machine capacity so I think that
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.480]   model makes a lot of sense whether that's the exact model they'll use I don't know but
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.760]   it did work well for Gmail.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.080]   Yeah I hope they do that soon.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   I think that's it.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:50.920]   Question for you if you've now that you've used Wave and I'm jealous.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.840]   There's some argument that sometimes you can release a beta too early.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.720]   There's a long time to release it.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.880]   Do you think Wave is released too early?
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   I don't think so.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   I don't think so.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   Not to the developers that are released too.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.560]   I mean I don't know what the numbers are of how many people are on there but I think
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.440]   I think it wave is such a big paradigm shift I think it needed to go out early so that people
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.120]   could start getting ready for it and start thinking about the possibilities and really
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.680]   test it out.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:21.720]   I don't know maybe too much of an extreme I'm a big fan of just releasing early as long
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.960]   as something works kind of just enough to get the idea across and I think that Wave
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   does.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   But it's broken.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.480]   I mean I've crashed it a few times.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:34.160]   You get the error messages are funny actually and you know when you try again and it's like
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.160]   okay this is a beta and these are developers here you know working on it but no I didn't
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.480]   think it was too early.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.160]   It's actually kind of neat to see Google do that.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   It's great.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   Like hey here it is.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.160]   It works at all.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.000]   Yeah I love it.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.920]   And this is something that you need to kind of work out with a large group.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.280]   You can't just kind of try it in a small lab so I think that you need to do this.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.440]   Definitely and you need the early adopters the developers the tech savvy folks who see
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.240]   the value to see it grow up and to get in there and to have that kind of paradigm shift
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.880]   and then to show other people.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.800]   Much like Gmail when that went out and they were just invites that went out I think that
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.240]   you know that you really kind of had these early adopters say like look how cool this
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   is.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   Look at conversations.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.320]   Look at conversation view labels you know that kind of thing was such a big deal back
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   then remember that.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.600]   I mean it was a big paradigm shift so.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.600]   Well we'll see.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.520]   I'll hold a Gmail.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.400]   I'll hold a Gmail now.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.840]   April 1st 2004 is when it started out so five years.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.080]   It was April 4th day and everybody thought it was a joke when it was first.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.080]   I remember that.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.360]   Is this a joke?
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.640]   Maybe that's not a good day to launch a new product just for future reference and blogger
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.000]   you were just saying bloggers 10 years old right.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.400]   10 years old 1999 that made me feel really old.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.440]   God I remember my first blog.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.080]   What old is.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:02.440]   Jeff and I are guys.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:07.320]   Everybody's first blog was on blogger right it was Leo Jeff you guys both started on blogger.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.120]   I don't know if it was my first blog it certainly would have been one of the very first if not.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.680]   I think I used gray matter first and then I used blogger.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.200]   Okay okay maybe it was the other way around but yeah.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.800]   Blogger was definitely a product that I used to go like is this thing on you know hello
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.360]   world in my first blog post ever so I have all this you know kind of nostalgia about
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.320]   it and I actually I went on to work with with with with Meg her hand for quite some time
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.680]   after that so it was really cool to spend time with her and hear about you know what
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.960]   the what building blogger was like but you had 10 years I can believe that.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.880]   It was actually Meg and and the third founder who's the fifth beat of life forget his name.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.880]   Oh well forgot about the anniversary.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.320]   Yeah it was about three days later when they said oh that's right it's been 10 years.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   That's pretty cool.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   That's pretty cool.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.320]   That's pretty cool.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.320]   Yeah that's not unusual actually.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.080]   Actually I think it's my experience.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.640]   It's the other people who noticed not the not the people who did it you know they've moved
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.480]   on they're doing other stuff now.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.160]   And the other birthday was this week was chrome as a year year old.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.720]   Yay.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.320]   I love chrome.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.280]   I've been using the Mac version and it's very stable now or at least you know it's it's
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.480]   totally usable now.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.200]   I'm really happy about it.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.720]   Yeah well we're shipping with the bio.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.080]   So the bio is going to ship with chrome now.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080]   Really?
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080]   Wow.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.080]   Wow.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.760]   In in lieu of well no.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.680]   No I got all excited when I read that I thought man a bio with the chrome OS.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.440]   I got all excited that I said no no it's just the chrome browser.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.440]   So my question is when chrome actually you know officially supports extension so that
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.680]   so the version of the dev channel does right now but when it ships you know that when the
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.120]   when the final version ships extensions is it going to get as slow as Firefox.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.880]   This is this is my this is my worry and my my interest in this because Firefox is just
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   it's slow.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.160]   It's extensions that blogged it down.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.720]   I think there's maybe it's just a software like anything else gets old over time and as
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.040]   it creates you know new features and extensions and stuff it just starts to bog down.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.840]   I mean I just saw a tweet from Catherine Coric who's a online media person in the UK and
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.840]   she said oh good grief I'm about to give up on chrome currently varying one to fifty
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:18.480]   percent one to fifty seven percent CPU nine processes only six tabs open not refreshing
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.720]   pages so yeah it does slow down sometimes.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720]   Hmm.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720]   Hmm.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.120]   But the cool thing about chrome that I wish the Firefox has is that that ability to sandbox
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.720]   that you know the tab that crashes right that's the really cool really cool feature that I'd
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:37.040]   love to see and so they could sandbox the add-ons in a similar way that would be that
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.280]   would be revolutionary.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.120]   And I believe that is one of the features of Safari and Snow Leopard now is that those
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.320]   processes if they crash it does not crash the browser.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   Hmm.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.320]   Which is funny.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   Oh go ahead.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.320]   No no.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.880]   No I was going to say Matt your full time your full time Chrome user.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.160]   Oh nothing but Chrome.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.760]   I had to fire a Firefox earlier today which I love and used before Chrome and I counted
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.080]   and it took twenty seconds to fire Firefox up from a cold start.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.480]   And certainly Chrome does you know sometimes run into issues but that Jeff that tweet that
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.400]   you read out boy in my experience Chrome is much much faster especially for stuff like
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:22.000]   Gmail so I have to stop myself from sort of you know talking about chrome too much because
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.200]   I just I'm a really big fan and when you add extensions yeah you have to be careful I
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.360]   don't think you want to add too many or else it could slow down but just on a day to day
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.160]   basis every time I open up a new tab it's so fast I just I'm a big girl.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.240]   Is there a limit to the number of tabs you can safely drive?
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.000]   Not that I've hit but I try to be pretty good hygiene.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.920]   You know I don't keep more than twenty open at a time or so.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.720]   It's pretty common that geeks have hundreds of tabs open at once.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.080]   I think we will hear if there is a limit we'll find out fairly soon.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.560]   And Matt you don't miss your extensions your Firefox extensions at all or to take a little
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.160]   time for you to get used to not having you know whatever.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.000]   Yeah that's what I'd miss.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.840]   You know my brother is a mechanical engineer at a company that makes laser printers and
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:12.600]   I went to visit him at work one day and he hadn't even changed his background image his
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:19.240]   desktop wallpaper and I realized sometimes we get so caught up in being more productive
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.400]   that we spend more time on that productivity.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.240]   And so every time I've gone back I think Chrome has made good decisions where you know maybe
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.920]   I'd prefer that the tabs open all the way to the right instead of right next to it or
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920]   something like that.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.680]   But in general once you get past that if you can take that leap and say you know what
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.280]   there's no one extension that's so incredibly useful I can't do without it.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.880]   Boy it's the speed more than makes up for it.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   I will be glad to see extensions get finalized though.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.720]   Something like Flashflop stuff like that.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.040]   Well I think there's so many things we could talk about still there's still a lot of stories.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.800]   We've started talking about Donut but we didn't talk about the new Google Marketplace.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:05.840]   We'll table that for another day because we want to start wrapping this up with our usual
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.720]   wrap up which is starting with Gina's tip of the week.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   Gina?
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:16.280]   The tip of the week this week is for Mac users who upgraded to Snow Leopard.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.760]   Now in iCal you can sync your Google Calendar which supports CalDav in pretty much just one
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.680]   step and I have the screenshot on my site which will include a link in the show notes.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.040]   Basically in iCal if you just go to preferences and settings and accounts you type in your
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.560]   Google account credentials whether it's a vanilla Gmail account or Google Apps account
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.680]   and your Google Calendar shows up in iCal it's two ways sync so any changes you make in the
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.160]   web interface or within iCal get sync back automatically.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.680]   It's a lot easier in 10.6 in Snow Leopard than it was in Leopard.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.760]   In Leopard you had to know some CalDav server settings or you had to install this separate
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.280]   application but right now it's one thing that Snow Leopard did really well was make that
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.680]   synchronization super easy.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.000]   You can also sync and I didn't know this in the post but you can also sync your address
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.880]   book to your Google contacts very easily too and that was available in Leopard.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.400]   In fact now that they've got both of those in address book and iCal you just give it
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.840]   your Google credentials and you're done that's really the way it ought to be.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.840]   I think that's huge improvement.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.200]   I did that immediately.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.640]   Now I used a program I used to use Busy Sync Merlin Man recommended that to sync my calendar
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   with Google Calendar.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.080]   Now they've come out with a standalone calendar application for the Mac called Busy Cal and
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.960]   I've been playing with that and it's a little bit better than iCal with the built-in sync
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   but I don't know.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.520]   I mean with this built-in now to iCal I don't know if they're going to have a market for
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.080]   Busy Cal.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.800]   Jeff you're a number of by the way smarterware.org that's Gina's blog and her tip and screenshot.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.880]   Whoops there's tip and screenshot are right there on the webpage.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.600]   Smarterware.org now it's time for our number of the week.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.560]   Well first time by the Jarvis family wants to thank Gina because Jake installed your
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.320]   tip from week before last on a permanent little tiny tab windows.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.320]   Is that cool?
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.320]   That's great.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   Awesome.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.320]   Cool.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.880]   So the number is 1 and 51.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.400]   One is that Google News added a new language which is Arabic which I think may be important
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.680]   for the world and then Google Translate at the same time is now speaking 51 languages.
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:28.880]   They've added Afrikaans, Belarusian Icelandic which actually I would find very handy during
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.040]   the crisis I wanted to read some Icelandic sites.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.960]   Irish, Macedonian, Malay, Swahili, Welsh and my favorite Yiddish.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   Finally some good cursing out of Google.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.080]   Who does anybody publish I mean is there a Yiddish paper out there?
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.080]   I guess there must be.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080]   There's gotta be.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.080]   That's cool.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.080]   I'll just ask.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.160]   So what's your experience with those translations equality of those translations Jeff I mean you
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.280]   are you able to read newspaper articles?
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:58.160]   Well no but but you know it all starts and ends with my ego and so if I see you know a
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.320]   French site complain about me I can go on to translation tools and get a sense of it.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   Right.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.400]   My German is really really bad but I use it to supplement and help out my translation.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.760]   So it's it's a good aid and I have to believe it will only get better.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.800]   I'm surprised there are more feedback tools.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.600]   That's what Gina said before about wanting to tell the transcription of messages that
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.720]   she's Gina and not Tina.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.520]   Similarly here I wish I could tell we could all tell Google translation when they got it
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.280]   right and how to improve the syntax but I guess it's more complicated than one for
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.560]   one word swap.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.560]   That's true.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.760]   Boy that would be the way to make it better wouldn't it?
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.600]   I use it if exactly as you do my French isn't great so I'll kind of give it use it to get
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.560]   a little jog and then take that and say oh yeah that's right but maybe I need to change
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.800]   that syntax a little bit and it's been pretty good.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.400]   It's pretty good on French I asked my daughter who's fluent in French.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.760]   She wants to learn Arabic next so there you go.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.720]   And my Google tool has been around for a couple of months now but boy something people probably
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:01.280]   don't know about and should have known about is Google squared.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.080]   This is a new way of looking at a search result if you go to google.com/squared.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.960]   It gives you a kind of a spreadsheet table of results which in some cases is really good.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.400]   This for instance use the sample that they offer of roller coasters.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.200]   You can get a list of roller coasters and in the table you get a column of images, descriptions,
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.920]   weight, length and so forth.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.240]   I mean this is amazing that this does this.
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.560]   What a useful way to get some information.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.040]   You can even export it out to your Google spreadsheet.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.240]   I love Google squared.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.200]   It depends on what you're looking for.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.840]   Obviously it works best for data where there are a number of representative items in the
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.200]   set for instance US presidents.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.320]   Here it gives you a great table of US presidents and that sort of thing.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:57.480]   Google squared, a clever way of tallying Google search results data in a much more useful
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.480]   way.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:04.440]   It just shows you once you get the data, as you were saying about the Google Book Initiative,
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.040]   once you get the data in there the sky is the limit on the kinds of massaging you can
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.440]   do and manipulation you can do to it.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.720]   There's a lot of great structure on the web and there's a lot of fun things to be discovered
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.760]   about how people work well on the web.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.000]   It's exciting that people can do a lot more now than they could even a few years ago like
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.800]   when Gmail rolled out or when Blogger rolled out.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.960]   Matt, I'm so glad that we were able to get you in through the good graces of Twitter
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.440]   direct messaging.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.760]   Thanks for having me.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.200]   I'll try to have a webcam next time.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.920]   We'd love to see your crew max.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   It does make it a lot easier I have to say.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:50.640]   If you want Matt, if I had known ahead of time I could send, we routinely send out contributors,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.480]   headsets and cameras and anything you need.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.960]   Next time before you come on I'll make sure we FedEx you.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.800]   We sent out a Logitech QuickCam 9000 for it.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.840]   I think he'll need a little more notice next time.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.840]   Yeah, I think the problem was that you actually got notice that we wanted to go on the show
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.000]   15 minutes into the show.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.200]   That's got to be our new record for our last minute invitations today.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.600]   Matt, you're awesome for being so quick on your feet.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600]   Thank you.

[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840]   Yeah, I'll...
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.640]   And not Viagra.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   Not Viagra.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.640]   No, no.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   And then back to targeting some spam.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.640]   So I appreciate the break.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.960]   We're glad we could give you a little break.
