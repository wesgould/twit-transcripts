[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.200]   Carrier-humping net neutrality surrender monkeys.

[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.280]   This week in Google that show the covers,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.240]   Google and the cloud, and online with us right now,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.360]   of course, the great Gina Trapani of smarthereware.org.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.120]   Hey, Gina, how are you today?
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.760]   I'm fine.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.360]   Thank you, me.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.880]   Thank you for the wrong picture.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.080]   Oh, don't worry.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.480]   Pay no attention to the man.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.240]   There you go.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.960]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.880]   How are you today?
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.800]   Hello.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.280]   Gina.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.480]   Good.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.280]   How are you doing?
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960]   Gina's been in mourning all week over Google Wave,
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   biting the dust.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.560]   But you still--
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.320]   Did you see that there was a protest group started?
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.800]   Well, of course--
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.320]   I did.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.160]   You're ought to be.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.360]   Save Google Wave.com.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.200]   Save the Wave.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.360]   It's a sizable protest.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.320]   I'm impressed with the pluck of my fellow Wave enthusiasts.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.160]   Well, they said there were a million users.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.760]   That's a lot.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.440]   I mean, it's nothing compared to Farmville, but it's a lot.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.200]   Oh, that's just sad.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.720]   You should have written the complete cows and wave.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.600]   It was a fun.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.920]   The complete guide to Farmville, you
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.840]   would have done much better.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.720]   But anyway, you could still get the book.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.640]   It's a collector's item now.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.120]   Complete guide.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.440]   He is a collector's item.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.000]   You notice I changed the lower third, though.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.720]   It's going to say smarter where.org from now.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   Yeah, thank you for doing it.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.440]   Wave?
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   Wave.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.940]   Wave?
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.440]   I don't know.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.040]   Also with us, as you've probably heard,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.520]   Jeff Jarvis, he is the author of What Would Google Do?
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.560]   And Google is still in business, so the book is still available.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.160]   For now.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.320]   For now.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.560]   I think Google will last.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   But there is a copy of it.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.440]   What would Google do?
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.520]   I keep it by my side at all times.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.480]   It's a book for all business people.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.320]   What would Google do in this situation?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.120]   That's a question I ask myself all the time.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.760]   Oh, if we were asking this week.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   This week, we have a very, very big question
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.600]   in joining us to help us with a discussion.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.720]   I can't show her because she's on the phone,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.400]   because her power is out in Austin.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.360]   Stacy, hit the hit and bottom of gigaohm.com.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.640]   Stacy, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.560]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.920]   Nice to have you here.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.680]   Stacy wrote a very good article talking
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.040]   about your blog post, Internet Schmitternet.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.400]   Mr. Jarvis.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   Stacy, would you summarize what happened this week
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.000]   between Google and Verizon?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.440]   Sure.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.280]   Together, the two of them came to a compromise agreement
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.960]   over net neutrality.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.720]   Net neutrality has been an issue for almost five years.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.480]   And last year in September, the FCC
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.080]   had opened up a whole proceeding trying
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.920]   to establish regulations for net neutrality.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.760]   And they kind of got bogged down.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.640]   And so Google and Verizon, they've been working together
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.800]   for a while on this since the proceedings were opened.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.040]   And on Monday, they just launched with,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.740]   basically, this is how we see net neutrality
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.800]   with net neutrality, we think it should work.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.400]   Yeah, I accept that everybody in the world went, what?
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.640]   In fact, some people even said this was a sure sign
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.600]   that Google is evil.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800]   Somebody called them surrender monkeys on one.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   Why are you doing that?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.600]   Failure humping surrender monkeys.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.760]   OK, let's get it all out.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.040]   That was wired.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.800]   It was awesome.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   Yeah, it was.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.680]   A lot of anger about this.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.000]   Google said, well, what was Google's response
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.320]   to the criticism?
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.800]   I haven't heard yet.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   No, their response-- the only response we've
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   had from Google and Verizon, other than the editorial
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.400]   in the Washington Post, was that press conference
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.840]   on Monday.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.560]   In both Eric Schmidt and Ivan Seidenberg
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.200]   were terrible on the press conference.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.880]   Eric is very bad at this stuff.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.640]   He has consistently proven that he does not know how to spin.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.920]   Which is maybe-- maybe that's--
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.720]   that might be a good virtue, actually.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.040]   But-- so Google's position was kind of--
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.840]   in my understanding was, well, look, it's not everything
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.600]   we would want, but we wanted to take this opportunity
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.320]   to at least get some rules about net neutrality.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.800]   Essentially, what it sounds to me-- correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.640]   And Jeff and Gina please weigh in on this.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.120]   But it sounds to me what the Google Verizon Pack did
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.720]   is say, yeah, they'll be net neutrality
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.600]   for everybody except wireless carriers.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.120]   And wireless carriers, like Verizon and AT&T,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.040]   who recently weighed in with--
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.360]   Yeah, we agree.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.160]   Wireless carriers should be allowed to do basically anything
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.360]   they want, including tier, differentiate services,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.800]   charge more for some, less for others, essentially,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   completely abrogate any idea of net neutrality,
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.440]   and build, in effect, what some critics have called,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.600]   a dual internet, a public internet,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   and then a private telecom-based network
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   for value-added services.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.200]   Just the fact that we're using the term public internet
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   makes me want to stab myself in the eye.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.800]   Because that implies that there's another internet, which
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.400]   is exactly what Jeff wrote about, internet internet.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.760]   There's a couple of internets, right?
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.200]   I mean, it's that, yes, you have this old dog internet
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.480]   showing you cat videos on YouTube.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.200]   But oh, you're not in your house right now?
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.240]   Oh, that's not the internet, I said in my post.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.480]   That's the Schmittternet as an internet Schmittternet.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.440]   And so, oh, it's a news service.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.120]   It's a, you know, an education service that didn't exist before.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.560]   Oh, sorry, sir, that's the Schmittternet.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.320]   And on the Schmittternet, we'll take you through all
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.520]   of our new fees and restrictions and regulations.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.560]   Please hold.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.320]   Well, let me be the devil's advocate here.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.960]   There's some precedent for stuff like this
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.360]   in the early days of cable, for instance, cable internet.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.680]   The FCC gave cable companies a lot of concessions.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.320]   For instance, the power of monopoly saying,
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.800]   in order to justify the cost of building this out,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.680]   we believe the internet's important.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   We're gonna give you some concessions here.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.080]   Isn't that what's going on?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.360]   That because of the, it's clear that anybody who's using
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   iPhone understands that when it comes to wireless internet,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.880]   it's a different beast.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.240]   And so, doesn't it make sense?
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.040]   Well, yes, no, we don't.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.480]   I think it's not, it's not the guy who's doing that now.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.560]   Okay. Sorry, Stacy, go ahead.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.280]   Go ahead, Stacy, and then we'll go to Jeff.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.840]   No, no, I was just gonna say, so the wireless stuff,
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.240]   I will 100% agree that you cannot have
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.480]   the same exact network management practices
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.320]   or wireless. It's clear.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.920]   Yeah, I mean, they're just not in the band.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.360]   They're not gonna work. Yeah.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.600]   But the way that they've phrased this,
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.440]   they've, instead of fighting for as much as one could hope for
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.880]   in terms of getting some kind of reasonable network management
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.160]   and coming up with some ways to define that for wireless,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.080]   that may be different from wired.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680]   Google and Verizon have hijacked the whole process,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.920]   taking it outside of the realm of the FCC.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.600]   Yes.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   And what's likely is Congress is going to listen to this
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.720]   and say, oh yeah, and that's,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.360]   basically is already in a position right now where Congress
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.040]   is looking to scan that and saying, whoa, there,
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.440]   you don't wanna regulate the internet.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.840]   Right. Right.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.600]   Yeah, I think that's exactly right, Stacy.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.480]   I think that the problem here is that this was not the FCC
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.920]   or the government giving concessions.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.200]   This was the companies asking for their own concessions
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.160]   and saying this is their ideal.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.960]   And you know, you have Google, which only a year ago,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.000]   was pushing for the white spaces around broadcast
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.160]   to be freed from regulations so that they could become,
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.480]   quote, "wifi" on steroids in their words
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.000]   and could provide competition to the wireless providers.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.320]   And the whole idea of mobile and wireless becomes
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.040]   an oxymoron, becomes ridiculous, becomes meaningless.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.560]   So I walk with my iPad, which I don't have,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.440]   if imagine I did, I walk with my iPad from my home
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.400]   when it's on wifi, I walk outside, it goes to cellular.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.360]   Oh, sorry, you've just gone to the Schmitternet.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.080]   Now you can't get this and this and this,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.240]   now you have to pay for this and this and that.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.160]   And if that wireless so-called, that mobile so-called,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.560]   came from some new provider like white spaces,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.240]   like, you know, new technologies, where does that go?
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.960]   The internet is the internet is the internet, damn it.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.400]   And if we end up with multiple internet that sucks,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.600]   what Stacy's really quite right about is,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.080]   the problem is these guys,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.840]   but I still don't understand why Google did this.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.320]   I do not get why Google did this.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.160]   I don't have--
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.320]   It feels like capitulation.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.960]   It really does.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.440]   And the problem is that these guys negotiated the future
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.680]   of the internet without the owners of the internet sitting
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.280]   there and the owners of the internet are us doing it.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.680]   And we've got to yell and scream and have a fit
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.880]   because the internet is not Google's, it's not Verizon's,
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.680]   it's not the FCC's, it's ours.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.720]   And I hate to plug this whole post that nobody cares about,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.160]   but this is why I wrote this Bill of Rights in cyberspace.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   Love this space.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.120]   Because if we the people don't stand up on principle
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.680]   and say, butt out, ass wipes, get out of here.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.280]   This is not yours, this is ours.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.080]   Yeah, we pay for the broadcast.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   What we want is more competition, more choices, more openness,
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.520]   more development, more people on the internet.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.040]   And if we start doing this, it's going to clamp down on this
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.320]   and it's going to clamp down on our economy as well.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.160]   Sorry, end of should be.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.560]   - Axel Librias in our chat room quotes a past Google
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.840]   statement that says, there's no network problem allegedly
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.400]   solved by prioritization that cannot also
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.840]   be solved by additional bandwidth.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.160]   Google in the past has said, just throw more bandwidth at it.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.920]   Now I guess that you still haven't answered my devil's advocate
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.240]   question, which is, because of the bandwidth constrain nature
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.840]   of wireless telecommunications, is it not unreasonable to say
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.200]   it should be treated differently than land?
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.840]   - It's legal by that logic then, should
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.000]   fly over to the house, be treated differently from Calc Hopper.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.760]   - Because it's more capable.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.480]   All right, go ahead Stacey.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.520]   - Well, I was going to say carriers can treat it differently
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.720]   in a way that's perhaps competitive.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.400]   So things like congestion pricing.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.120]   And I know people hate when I'm--
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.040]   I mean, people hate cured pricing.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.560]   I'm against it as a principle.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.640]   But if you're worried about congestion on your network,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.600]   don't limit people to five gigabytes per month.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.440]   - Discharge the network.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.840]   - Charge the more for it.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.240]   Charge the more during times when you're experiencing
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.520]   usage, recognize the fact and tell consumers about the fact
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.440]   that if for some instance a hurricane hits,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.760]   yeah, their YouTube streams are going
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.160]   to be deprioritized below voice calls.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.680]   That makes sense.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.080]   - That's interesting.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.320]   - I had never heard that before.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.840]   Is that a solution that people have been proposing?
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.440]   - That's what-- I mean, Eric Schmidt will talk about that.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.560]   I mean, when he was at the thing in Tahoe last week,
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.120]   he talks about figuring out how to prioritize traffic.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.760]   And he made it sound like what Verizon and they were agreeing
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.040]   to was something like that.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.920]   And the carriers will also say that that's
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.760]   kind of their friendly face of this.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.120]   But there's no rules in place for that.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.560]   And it's hard to write those rules into legislation
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   without them being kind of subverted later on.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.800]   And that's why this is such a contentious issue.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.040]   I don't know if you guys want nuance or not, but that's--
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.680]   - We do want nuance.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.000]   We're absolutely-- that's kind of what the show is about.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.680]   - We feed on nuance.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.080]   - Nuevances are middle-day.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   - And I think that that's to me, you know,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.080]   what you're going to see is a very--
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.920]   and we already have seen is very black and white.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.200]   I'm again at-- or I don't know what my name is in favor
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.600]   of what Google and Verizon have done,
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.360]   but presumably somebody is AT&T anyway.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.920]   But I think there is more than just the yes or no to it.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.960]   That's what I'm trying to get at.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.840]   It seems like there's some rationalization
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.960]   for giving at least temporarily--
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.040]   and maybe that's the mistake here--
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.480]   that this doesn't sound like a temporary measure--
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.800]   but temporarily giving wireless companies a little pass.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   No?
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:13.600]   - I think there's a place for doing real case-by-case adjudication.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.720]   That's probably the wrong word.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.680]   At the FCC for net neutrality kind of rules.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.920]   The problem is right now, the FCC doesn't actually--
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.840]   unclear if they have the authority--
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.160]   actually enforce any of that,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.320]   which is what this whole process is designed to do.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.960]   So implementing some kind of network neutrality
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.360]   in talking about reasonable network management
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.800]   on wireless networks by saying that you at least get
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.440]   something down.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.000]   And then when cases come up, the FCC actually
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.640]   has the ability to go in and say,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.920]   hey, carrier, don't do this.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.560]   Right now that doesn't exist.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:52.920]   - Yeah.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.240]   - The public space isn't a part of that
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.560]   is the FCC, of course, as of right now,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.640]   does not have authority over this.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.760]   - Well, there's some question about it
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.640]   after the Comcast reversal.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.120]   Although I've talked to--
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.240]   I have a number of offline conversations
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.160]   with people who say, well, you can't interpret
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   the Comcast reversal too broadly.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.000]   The court didn't say the FCC doesn't have the right to do it.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.480]   They just said it wasn't doing it correctly in this case.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.560]   So it's very unclear.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:25.040]   It's very unclear what the FCC's mandate is.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.880]   And of course--
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.640]   - What the FCC is trying-- do you want to know?
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.120]   - Yes, I would love to know.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.720]   What does the FCC think of this?
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   I guess they'd be another group that's against this
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.840]   because it's undermining their authority.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.760]   - So my sources of the FCC are--
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.200]   they're staying silent on it.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.040]   They don't want to comment basically on this
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.880]   because it's something that they feel like talking about it
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.320]   can don't with this as a legitimate solution.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.200]   - They don't want to legitimize it at all.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   - But there is a clear power vacuum.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.640]   There's a clear lack of leadership from the FCC right now
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.080]   because of the whole reclassification debate,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.040]   which is what you're talking about after Comcast,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   where they're trying to figure that out.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   And net neutrality is actually tied to that
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.160]   because if they don't have the authority
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.720]   to legislate and attribute or regulate broadband,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.760]   they can't implement net neutrality.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.520]   So they're really closely tied.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   And the FCC is trying to work this from all angles.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.600]   And I personally think it's failing miserably.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.720]   And that gave Verizon and Google the ability to step up
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   and pose this and get so much traction.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.040]   - I mean, Google says that this is really--
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   they're proposing a blueprint for legislation.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.000]   It sure would be nice if Julius Genikowski or somebody--
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.320]   you know somebody at the FCC, Gina.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.400]   You were talking about it.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.440]   If somebody steps it up and said, hey, wait a minute.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.040]   This isn't what--
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.680]   - There was a comment.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.320]   There was an official comment by Michael J. cops.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.800]   He said, some will claim this announcement
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.520]   moves the discussion forward.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.320]   That's one of its many problems.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.920]   It's time to move a decision forward,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.200]   the decision to reassert FCC authority
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.800]   over broadband telecommunication
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.280]   to guarantee an open internet now and forever--
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.760]   - Yes.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.920]   - And this is my favorite part.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.160]   But the interests of consumers in front of the interests
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.480]   of giant corporations.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.000]   - Yes.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.480]   - That was the most heartening response I could have possibly.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.320]   I mean, that was like--
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.120]   - He's just one of five commissioners.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   Sorry, he's just one of five commissioners.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.160]   And so cops is coming out strongly.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.960]   So you at least now see some discussion and some fighting.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.840]   I just put on the friend feed, Susan Crawford,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.200]   the brilliant Susan Crawford wrote a post this morning
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   basically telling the FCC to grow a pair.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.680]   - Yeah.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.080]   - And I think that's the point.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.520]   I think I think Stacy, you're right, there's a vacuum.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.960]   I think Gina, you're absolutely right
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.920]   that what cops says is what they should all be doing.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.000]   But the problem is he's basically protesting
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.960]   against the FCC from inside the FCC.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.920]   - Well, there's a long history of that, by the way.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.760]   - Yeah, right.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.120]   - Of division among FCC commissioners.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.320]   That's not at all unusual.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   I'd like to know where Jenna Kowski stands on this
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.360]   because I mean, he's the one who needs
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   to take a leadership role here.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   And he's been very outspoken for internet neutrality.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.840]   He, I think he had a lot to do with the broadband plan
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.240]   that the FCC put forward.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.840]   - He did have, when the New York Times had that story
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.000]   on Monday saying that they had reached a deal
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.280]   and presented it somewhat differently than this.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.520]   Jenna Kowski did say that basically he was pissed about this
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.280]   and that there would be no more meetings under their ages.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.960]   - That's right, they did call off that,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.120]   the conferences, that's right.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.240]   Stacy, go ahead, you're gonna say something.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   - Well, those conferences weren't going anywhere.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.640]   And so Jenna Kowski called those off because
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.720]   those weren't, they weren't making progress.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.200]   So once this whole thing became public,
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.640]   he knew he was gonna fail.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.600]   You might as well just fail without being castigated
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.280]   for having all these secret meetings.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.880]   - Right, so instead we've got this backroom deal
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.920]   between two major corporations with,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.160]   what we thought were different interests,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.640]   but apparently are maybe not so different.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.680]   - Well, it's not really a deal.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.960]   I mean, it's not policy, right?
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   I mean, Verizon Google don't create policy.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.600]   - It's proposed policy.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.440]   - It's a proposal, it's a proposal.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.040]   And also, let me just say,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.800]   the wireless thing broke my heart,
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.320]   but the rest of the document is great.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.560]   Like I'm within the whole way.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.160]   - The new services part, Jenna?
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.600]   - No, the new services part.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.200]   - Okay, what is the new services part?
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.360]   Let's hear that story.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.040]   Jeff, what is the new services part?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   - Maybe Stacy's probably a better position to say it,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.520]   but it's another carve out.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.640]   - Stacy?
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.400]   - Yeah, there's three big, I mean, there are three problems.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.360]   One, it emasculates the FCC.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.160]   Actually, one would be wireless, but we've talked about that.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.160]   - Right.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.280]   - And then there's a carve out for managed services.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.520]   They don't call it that, they call it
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.000]   Oh, additional network services.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And that's things like Uverse or FiOS TV.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.040]   Or anything that the carrier and the FCC has been
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   all the way back in October and September
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.400]   was worried about this because it's a way to say,
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.920]   in the worst case scenario, I have, you know,
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.520]   this may not happen, I may be crazy.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   But to say, we're gonna develop our broadband infrastructure
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.400]   and we're gonna allocate X amount of it
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.560]   to our advanced network services, which cost extra,
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.520]   which, you know, you may have to pay as a consumer.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.560]   And if you wanna get on it as a service,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.800]   like a web service, maybe you have to pay.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.840]   Maybe you don't, we're not sure.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.800]   And then what happens is you got just like a little ghetto.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.640]   - Yeah, but what's wrong with that?
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.760]   If Verizon has a VCAST service
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.520]   that lets you watch broadcast television,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.440]   what's wrong with them saying that?
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.480]   - That's fine.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   That's, this is a private service.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   - But here's the problem, yeah.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.320]   - Okay.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.600]   - It's a big open door.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.760]   It's a hanger door sized exception
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.200]   because it says, the example they give
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.400]   is that if an Opera wanted to broadcast in 3D
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.640]   and it used a lot of bandwidth, that's new
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.960]   and then that's outside of neutrality.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.120]   Well, so anything new is just internet.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   - Right.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.800]   - That, yeah.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   - And that's an example they call.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.040]   - So the E-Fap makes a really good point.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.880]   - Go ahead, Gina.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.080]   - No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut off Stacy.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.920]   I was gonna say, you know,
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.200]   the additional online services is very vague, vaguely defined,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.040]   right?
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.880]   We don't really know what that is.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.720]   I mean, they're trying to future proof.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.560]   They're trying to say, you know,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.400]   new things are gonna come out.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.240]   We don't wanna squatch innovation.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.160]   We want those new things to happen.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.080]   We don't know what they're gonna be,
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.240]   but we're just gonna call them additional online services.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.360]   That's troubling.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.520]   Also, the definition of reasonable network management,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.600]   you guys all seem to agree,
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.840]   you're like, oh yeah, mobile networks are different.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.760]   I don't, I mean, yes, they're technically different,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.680]   but are they really different?
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.560]   Like, what is reasonable network management?
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.120]   What does that mean?
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.960]   Exactly.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.800]   Like I felt like the--
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.240]   - It could be as much as blocking YouTube over wireless.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.080]   Right.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.400]   - So, network, I mean, like wireless networks,
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.920]   like the constraints that they are under,
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.640]   I mean, you've got a certain amount of spectrum, right?
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   And you have a certain amount of bandwidth that fits
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   into each like megahertz of spectrum.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.840]   And the issue is if you're,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.560]   you send that to towers and people are moving in and out,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.320]   it's actually really complicated to keep track of.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.680]   And so,
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.960]   there's the limited amount of spectrum, right?
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.480]   Which kind of limits the capacity
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.200]   at anyone place in point in time.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.240]   And then there's also the issue of tracking these users
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.680]   as they're trying to like stream,
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   which is really hard and like intensive
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.240]   over the wireless network.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.720]   While other people are trying to do like voice calls.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.160]   And, you know, maybe we shouldn't be prioritizing voice calls.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.200]   And in all, in like a 4G network,
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.960]   we won't have to because they're all IP.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.800]   - Right.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   - I don't know.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.240]   - We know from-- - There are issues with that.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.720]   - We know from the Wired article,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.000]   or we, at least the Wired article asserted, for instance,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.640]   that AT&T wanted to, but did propose to Apple
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.080]   that YouTube videos stop after 10 seconds on the iPhone
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.120]   because it was killing their network.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.880]   That's, I'm sure, the exact kind of thing
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.800]   that these wireless carriers would like to see.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.040]   Is that a violation of net neutrality?
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.960]   Or is it just a reasonable statement
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.560]   that we just don't have the capacity yet?
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.840]   - It's a really good reason for AT&T
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.000]   not to build up their capacity.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.760]   Every single network has limitations.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.120]   And the fact is that you have to build up
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.200]   your infrastructure. - Right.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.400]   - The demand is there and do it.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.840]   Yes, I appreciate the technical limitations
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.480]   of the mobile network, but figure it out.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.880]   It's a technical problem.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.400]   We can figure it out. - Right.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.240]   - I don't know.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.720]   It's the same thing like Jeff said earlier.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   Why treat internet over copper differently than broadband?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.240]   - It seems-- - It isn't some of this
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.480]   because we've seen how anti-competitive
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.240]   the wireless companies are in the past.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.080]   - Right, I think that's it.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.680]   And Google says, Google acted as if, well,
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.760]   wireless is different 'cause there is competition there.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.600]   No, there's not.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.720]   - There's no other way around.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.560]   - Yeah, the other way around. - I still have the way around.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.440]   - Exactly.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.760]   Let me try it this way.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.080]   - Oh, Leo, just three steps.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.440]   Step one is that imagine if this document came not
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.840]   from Google and Verizon, from Verizon and AT&T.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.680]   - Oh boy.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.160]   - We would not probably never be very surprised at all.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.000]   - There'd be no discussion.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.240]   - There'd be like a few moves, a few inches.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.680]   Well, but they do a few things.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.960]   They make a few concessions.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.440]   Okay, we see what they're negotiating, right?
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.360]   That's step one.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.440]   Step two is what shocks us so much
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.680]   that Google's involved in this.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.840]   And I'm gonna come back to that.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.720]   And I don't fully understand why.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.280]   I think Wired came to the closest to say,
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.000]   "Well, because Google is now a phone company."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.120]   They're a carrier hunting net neutrality surrender monkey.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.000]   - So that's where Google's shot.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.920]   - That's why this is so heartbreaking.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.840]   - Well, by the way, this is the only,
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.960]   this might be the week we say Google suddenly stopped
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.640]   not being evil.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.160]   - It's not happening evil.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.800]   - Because there's also this document
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.480]   and there's Eric Schmidt going around.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.800]   Eric Schmidt says, "The future of the web is no anonymity."
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.640]   - Right.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.040]   So let me try one more step on this.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.960]   One more step. - Okay.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.080]   - Which is that if someone were speaking
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.480]   on behalf of the internet,
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.800]   of what we used to call consumers, sorry, Doc Serals,
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   then how would any policy be written?
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.840]   Now, to answer Gina's question about mobile,
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.320]   or agree with Gina, the answer would be,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.280]   "If you say you deliver the internet,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.000]   you deliver the internet, damn it, period."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.560]   And we have standards for what it means
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.600]   to deliver the internet and delivering crappy internet
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.320]   is something you can, consumers can sue for.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.680]   - Right. - Because if I tell you
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.360]   I give you milk, really, I really give you
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.920]   is water and with chalk in it, you can be sued.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.760]   - Right. - You give me an internet
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.080]   that's not really the internet.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.120]   F you! - So this is good.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.600]   This is, so what it really comes down to,
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.160]   and this is what you've been saying,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.720]   it's what is the definition of the internet?
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.880]   - Right. - And what this is--
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.720]   - And how is that? - Right.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.000]   - We do. - Right.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.280]   - But we're not doing it, people.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.320]   - This is letting-- - We're not doing it.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.160]   We're not-- - We're not getting it up
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   and making these principles.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.760]   - It's letting these big companies decide
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.840]   what the internet is, and it's not what we've all said it is.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.520]   - Well, here, Leo, I got an idea, just now.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.800]   Uh-oh, watch out.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.520]   Coming out before your very eyes.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.320]   The tweet twig community should deliver their principles
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.560]   of the internet.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.560]   - I think we did it, Jeff. - We did it, Jeff.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.920]   You have that great bill of rights.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.200]   I would point people to-- - Yeah, just a great hard version.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.440]   It'll be geekier in this case than just big principles.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.120]   But we should say what we expect the FCC
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.400]   and Google and Verizon to do, because no one's saying it.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.360]   - When you do it, can you file it, you want it?
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.160]   - You can, I'm sure you can, and I don't know
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.440]   if you'd file with the FCC, but you could--
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.400]   - No, no, you have to file with the FCC.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.240]   That's what I'm saying. - Okay.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.000]   - We have a proceeding open and want comments.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.720]   - Great, where do we do that?
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.880]   - Oh, God.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.320]   - Well, find it, I'll find it.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.200]   The other thing is the EFF has gotten involved in this,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.560]   and I think the EFF might be the people
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.200]   that we need to look to try to defend us in this regard.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.520]   - Yes.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.040]   - You know, I didn't mean to walk over your statement,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   because I think there's two big things
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.880]   you were talking about there.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.440]   One is what the proper view of what the internet is.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.400]   Now we do that, but the other one is this being twig,
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.000]   Google, and I, as Google fanboy,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.040]   just really can't figure it out.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.920]   I think that they're gonna hurt themselves.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.960]   I don't get the strategy.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.120]   What did they gain?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.800]   Now, you know, again, if Verizon--
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.480]   - They said they said they realized
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.160]   that they'd have to give some concessions up
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   in order to get some other good things.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.680]   And so they gave this part, by the way,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.840]   it's not theirs to give up, but--
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.040]   - What, right.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.480]   - But they said we're gonna give up on these items.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.800]   By the way, the EFF says there's also another troubling,
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.960]   as long as we're gonna get into this.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.280]   There's also another troubling part of the proposal
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.880]   that says it applies only the lawful internet content.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.280]   - Yes, that's scary too.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   - Yeah.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.480]   - Who would, is copyrighted material?
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.680]   Well, it sounds like a copy distribution
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.120]   of copyrighted material by somebody other than
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.000]   the copyright holder is unlawful.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.240]   And then that, the EFF says, opens the door
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.040]   to an entertainment industry and law enforcement efforts
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.680]   that could hinder free speech and innovation.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   Of course it would.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.240]   They wanna do this desperately.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.480]   - They're already talking, I mean,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.000]   they're already commenting on the net neutrality,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.080]   feeding the EFFPC talking about.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.120]   - So you've got this axis of evil,
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.000]   which I'm sad to say that Google has joined
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.760]   between the big content companies,
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.000]   the big carriers, the wireless carriers,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.560]   now Google's involved.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.800]   And the feds, of course, the Congress is just gonna say,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.400]   "Well, hey, if Google says it's a good thing,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.680]   "Verizon says it's a good thing."
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.520]   Actually, I'm sure they--
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.360]   - But one of the, just sent me that a resolution
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.000]   was just put in the house,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.600]   commending Google and other companies for advocating
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.080]   uncensored internet, adhering to free speech principles
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.200]   and keeping the internet open for users worldwide
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.280]   from Representative Carolyn McCarthy.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.120]   - Yeah.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.400]   - July 13th, 2010.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.240]   Oh well.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.720]   - And the truth is a lie and black is white,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.800]   the peace is war.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.600]   - I just don't, I just don't get it.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.880]   So, so, so Leo, you just said Google got things.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.720]   What did they get?
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.800]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.520]   I mean, I guess they got on the land-based internet,
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.400]   they got a concession of net neutrality.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.240]   So--
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.080]   - Right.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.600]   - Old steam-powered internet.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.100]   - Yeah.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.960]   Of course, everything's moving mobile.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.040]   So I guess that's what they said.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.480]   Well, hey, at least we were able to get some rules made
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.080]   for net neutrality on the ones that,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.040]   why Google is not fighting for net neutrality globally
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.960]   is beyond me.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.560]   And this is one of the reasons we've given Google
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.760]   a pass for so long is because it was always my understanding
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.520]   that Google made its money by the free flow of the internet.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.880]   And for them to say, no, yeah, okay.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.720]   But when it comes to wireless services,
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.760]   maybe that's not the best thing.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   What are they getting a cut?
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.320]   - Well, yes, they are.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.360]   I mean, in the sense they're now in the phone business.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.200]   - They're in the phone business.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.560]   - They're in the phone business?
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.200]   - Part of the deal too is giving up the Nexus One.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.520]   - It's all part of the same thing.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.640]   They had an opportunity to say we're going to be in,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.480]   we're going to forward things along
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.360]   by creating a carrierless handset
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.920]   with an open source operating system.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.160]   We're going to support the open handset alliance.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.880]   We are going to break the monopoly
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.840]   of the cell phone companies in the US.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   And instead, they said,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.240]   well, maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.080]   We make so much money with Motorola and an HTC
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.080]   making these handsets for Verizon and AT&T.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.120]   Maybe we just go along with that.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.440]   You know, it's wow, 100,000 handsets a day.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.760]   That's a lot of handsets.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.200]   - It's really difficult not to go down that road,
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.240]   even for someone like me.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.760]   I mean, basically what they're saying is,
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.640]   you're good, your typewriter is going to work
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.880]   for the next five years.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.720]   - Yeah.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.960]   - You know, there's that.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.800]   - You know.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.000]   - They have, it doesn't affect them anymore.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.800]   And I mean, so just thinking,
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.600]   Google is a corporation, they're out there to make money.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.040]   And frankly, they have the infrastructure built up
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.080]   that they don't have to worry about wired net neutrality, right?
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.840]   So, I mean, they can do,
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.200]   they have, they have a CDN like services.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.280]   They're, they have the demand on the consumer side.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.920]   So maybe they thought, heck,
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.240]   we just bought wired net neutrality for everybody,
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.080]   but wireless, it's too much for us.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.640]   And frankly, we can go it alone because we're--
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.360]   - Yeah, but Stacy,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.000]   Eric Schmidt has said that they're going to make more money
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.360]   from mobile than they make from the internet today.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.880]   This matters greatly to them.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.840]   He said that in the past, he said that a year ago
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.280]   to Jim Kramer.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.880]   And so mobile matters,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.260]   then the thing is, if you get a whole
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.400]   Balkanized internet of a bunch of internet,
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.160]   that hurts Google, they can't search across it,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.600]   they can't place ads across it,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.400]   they can't get data across it.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.840]   So that's why I don't understand is that
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.400]   for Google's worldview and way of operating,
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.100]   a Balkanized internet, I think is bad for them.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.100]   - Well, yeah, you would think it's bad for everybody,
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.820]   except for Ryzen and AT&T and Comcast.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.780]   - I mean, are we taking it too far though?
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.260]   Is it really going to be a Balkanized internet?
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.020]   So okay, so maybe this is going to happen.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.660]   Maybe this becomes policy
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.660]   and we all have a choice of wireless providers
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.140]   and some of them let you stream,
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.340]   get your 3D, television or whatever,
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.740]   do those social services and some of them don't.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.220]   And it forces better, more competition,
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.380]   it forces more carriers to build up their infrastructure,
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.660]   to be more competitive.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.460]   Maybe it'll be a good thing.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.300]   (laughing)
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.500]   - I'm gonna get you a good day scenario.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.980]   (laughing)
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.380]   So here's the issue, right?
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.940]   We have no, we have very little competition
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.660]   in wired internet and that has brought us to a point
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.180]   where some people have fiber and some people
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.620]   like barely have brought in, band, right?
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.300]   And they pay a lot for it.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.900]   And then on the mobile side,
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.820]   the FCC, if you look at their broadband
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   and they're really trying hard to address all the areas
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.180]   that don't have sufficient broadband competition
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.940]   with mobile, they're really like banking,
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.780]   they're banking on that.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.780]   So if we go to a place where people in like four years
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.660]   are reliant on Verizon's LTE network to get,
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.300]   you know, their internet basically,
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.500]   their own internet, no wired,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.380]   then suddenly they're stuck on an internet
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.860]   where maybe they only get 10 seconds with YouTube.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.700]   And that's a problem.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.540]   - Bingo.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.380]   - That's the problem.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.100]   - In AT&T and Verizon have been buying up spectrum
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.220]   and they own a huge chunk of the seven megahertz spectrum
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.860]   that the LTE, the next generation of wireless
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.060]   is gonna go over and they're actually doing
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.540]   a lot of things right now, like policy wise,
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   to make sure other people have a harder time
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.700]   like competing with that.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.460]   - So.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.500]   - Well really, like Stacy Stacy,
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.500]   more about that, what's happening in the future?
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:31.580]   - So they filed petitions with the FCC to make,
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.100]   to claim like interference in certain channels
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.340]   of the 700 megahertz section near where rural carriers
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.140]   have their own 700 megahertz stake.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.500]   If they get that through,
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.860]   that lessens the incentive for someone like Qualcomm
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.900]   or a chip maker to make chips that work across the spectrum.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.820]   And instead those guys will choose to work with AT&T
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.500]   and Verizon because they have a huge customer base
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.060]   leaving their world guys with like handsets and devices
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.900]   that could cost a lot more.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.740]   So that's like--
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   - So I'm back in the HTML,
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.100]   HTML versus CDMA.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.180]   - Well no, you're really, I mean, it still might be all LTE,
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.780]   but it depends on like what frequencies you're tuning to
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.340]   and how many you want to tune to.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.740]   I mean, these are really nitty gritty,
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.740]   but Verizon and AT&T have really awesome lawyers
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.660]   who like really work with stuff.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.700]   They have the best congress money can buy.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.860]   I mean, Google, I don't know how much Google spends
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.460]   on congressmen, I don't think they spend much,
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.100]   but Verizon spends an awful lot.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.140]   And--
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.060]   - Well, and they have these workers.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.740]   They have unionized workers who vote like they're supposed to
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.940]   across a bunch of different congressional districts.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.540]   Silicon Valley has Silicon Valley.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.380]   - Right.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.980]   You point out in one of your articles on Gigahome
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.820]   that in effect, this sold tech companies out.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.700]   Companies like Pandora and Skype are the companies that lose here.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.380]   - Yeah.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.540]   - Because they're the ones that are gonna end up being blocked
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.100]   on these wireless networks 'cause they use so much bandwidth.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.060]   - Or they could be bopped,
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.140]   or they could have to do deal with carriers.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.540]   - They'll have to do deals with carriers.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.940]   We're already seeing that.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.460]   That's what's really happening in a very rapid way
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.660]   is that the carriers are rapidly asserting themselves
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.420]   in these markets, making deals.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.780]   This is a deal with Google.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.740]   Who knows what really happened behind the scenes.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.580]   These guys-- - No, you go back to it.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.960]   - Go ahead.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.800]   - Oh no.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.980]   If you go back to AT&T and they're deal with prodigy,
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.660]   they bought prodigy and then they had this deal with Yahoo,
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.500]   there's still tons of AT&T subscribers
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.300]   who go online through Yahoo, right?
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.140]   - Right.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.660]   - Because I mean, they do.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.820]   - That's their Syrian Net Service Provider
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.460]   and their incumbent carrier is AT&T.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.380]   - And they, I mean, so--
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.380]   - It's the Yahoo Internet.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.780]   - Those kind of feel good happen.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.740]   - Yeah. - Yeah, the Yahoo Internet.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.620]   - Yeah, they have a great history of this.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.500]   You also, this boy, this is a quote, a pull quote
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.860]   from the framework that you put in your article.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.300]   The FCC basically says the FCC doesn't have anything
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.140]   to do with this.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.380]   The FCC would enforce the consumer protection
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.180]   and non-discrimination requirements
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.020]   through case by case adjudication,
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.540]   but would have no rule making authority
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.820]   with respect to these provisions.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.780]   Parties would be encouraged to use non-governmental
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.100]   dispute resolution processes established by independent,
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.260]   widely recognized internet community governance initiatives
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.660]   and the FCC would be directed to give appropriate
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.260]   deference to decisions or advisory opinions
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.100]   of such groups.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.700]   It basically pulls the rug out entirely
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.500]   from the FCC's ability to regulate net neutrality.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.340]   It kills it.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.780]   I mean, I can see why your commissioner
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.000]   is a little upset here.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.260]   And the fine, $2 million, up to $2 million.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.780]   Nothing, it's chicken feet.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.380]   - It's more expensive to say bad words on here.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.500]   - Yeah, and they can't actually, yeah, that's right.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.620]   Howard Stern's much more at risk than, you know,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.220]   Verizon is.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.180]   And it can't make any rules as a consequence.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.420]   All they can do is fine.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.300]   - Right, and those fines could be overturned in court.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.020]   I mean, look what happened with Comcast blocking PDP.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.140]   - Right, they have to do it just right.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.420]   It's basically a tightrope that the FCC has to walk
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.620]   and they're kind of doomed.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:31.620]   - And the EFF was in support of this limited FCC jurisdiction.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.900]   They felt like this was a good thing.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:37.180]   - Well, I could tell you from my friends in the EFF board
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.700]   that there is dissension within the EFF, exactly.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.580]   You know, I mean, there are those who say,
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.900]   "Well, you gotta have net neutrality
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.380]   who's gonna enforce it besides the FCC."
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.260]   And people said, "Well, the government shouldn't be involved at all."
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.860]   By the way, and the chat rooms brought this up a number of times,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.900]   we're talking about the US.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.340]   Does this impact anybody else around the world?
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.140]   Or is this a US only issue?
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:03.060]   - There net neutrality things happening in Canada?
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.460]   I wanna see the UK, maybe France?
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.180]   I know that people are saying...
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.660]   - Does this become the template?
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.820]   This becomes a template for other countries then.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.380]   - Pretty much.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.740]   I mean, obviously not for every country,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.220]   but many countries are watching.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.060]   - Right.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:26.660]   - So Stacey, politically here,
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.420]   you've got the phone company at Google
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.100]   basically putting the FCC on warning
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.260]   that we're gonna have our own government screw you.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.380]   Where does this go?
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.860]   Congress is or isn't involved.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:47.300]   The FCC was planning this fall to claim provenance over the internet again.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.140]   I'm trying to understand the politics of this.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.060]   Where, what happens next from whom, how, why?
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.980]   Small question.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.380]   - Little questions.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.580]   This is a midterm election year.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.100]   And I am not deeply steeped in politics.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.140]   I am like a network nerd kind of person.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.980]   But my understanding is very little will happen,
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.300]   but Congress will bluster and threaten.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.860]   And the issue is, you know,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.660]   no one wants to vote to regulate the internet in an election year.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.460]   And that is what people are saying the FCC is trying to do
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.580]   when they do this broadband reclassification process,
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.900]   which is basically them trying to get back power
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.900]   to regulate broadband the way they regulate copper voicelines.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:41.220]   And so I don't think,
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.540]   I don't think much is gonna get done quite frankly.
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.420]   - So that's good.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.660]   So why did they do this?
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.820]   That's what I still think is a little,
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.820]   it must have been a tin year.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.620]   I must not have realized what the reaction would be to this.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.900]   - Oh, no, I, do you really think so?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.100]   - Well, I don't know, well, then why did they do it?
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.340]   If they knew that this would be the reaction,
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.820]   if they knew that whatever they said didn't really matter
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.860]   because we're in a midterm election year,
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.860]   if it didn't, doesn't even seem to really help their cause,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.820]   I don't know.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.980]   - Well, it'll get Congress, Congress will say,
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.300]   this is reasonable, we should do it, go FCC, go.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.580]   And the FCC will be like, really?
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.420]   Okay.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.580]   - Well, FCC lives at the pleasure of Congress.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.660]   They can only do it, Congress mandates.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.500]   Right?
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:35.980]   - So if Congress says that, FCC's, what are they gonna do?
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.700]   - Well, yeah, Congress writes legislation
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.780]   or changes the communications law to strip them of power
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.420]   and the FCC would have to take support.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.100]   - No choice.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.420]   - Well, here's the thing, I'm ruining my number of the week,
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.140]   but flick up for the greater good.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.980]   I'll do it.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.660]   - Oh, don't do it, Jeff, don't do it.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   - Yes.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.940]   - In the Pew study on broadband,
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.460]   that's just out of the states he mentioned,
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.140]   at the beginning, 53% of Americans polled
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.100]   do not believe that the government should make
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.700]   spreading broadband a government priority.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.620]   - That surprising is important.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   - That ain't good.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.460]   - Yeah.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.700]   - Because then there's not the, you add this all up
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.660]   and you'd think, well, there's a political will
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.060]   to say, stay off our internet,
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.820]   but I'm guessing this number comes out of a fear
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.100]   that that's gonna cost tax money or something.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.940]   And, or cause new fees like we have on phones
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.420]   to guarantee coverage.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.020]   And so, Congress will look at that and say,
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.140]   fight for your internet.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.060]   - Oh, why?
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:41.060]   - Let me kind of mix into this batter,
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.460]   this confidential seven page Google vision statement
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.780]   that the Wall Street Journal leaked,
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.500]   that shows that Google is right now grappling
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.660]   with this notion of how far it should go
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.860]   in profiting from our private information.
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:06.740]   Google's considering building a vast quote trading platform
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.100]   for buying and selling web data.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.540]   Should it let people pay not to see ads?
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.940]   I mean, it's not like they've made a decision,
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.540]   but it seems to be this is all part and parcel
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.660]   of the same thing, which is a Google that has decided
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.240]   to go for the gold.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.340]   And is somewhat leaving behind the principles
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.720]   that we kind of celebrated Google for.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.460]   I mean, they're a private, I mean,
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.460]   they're a public company, they're a business enterprise.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.300]   They're--
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.100]   - Yeah, this is what Seva and I will,
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.740]   Seva button up here and I will probably,
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.380]   if we get selected in, debate at South by Southwest.
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.980]   His proposal is, and right now I'm losing the debate,
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.900]   thank you Google.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.180]   But--
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.020]   - Yeah, his argument is--
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.340]   - South by Southwest is until his spring,
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.340]   this could get a lot worse, Jeff.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.860]   - Yeah, I'm, I want points, not gold.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.500]   - You could be in trouble.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.300]   - I want Tiger Woods, New Handy Cap.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:03.780]   So what Seva says is Jarvis, you know,
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.500]   when it came to China, you shouldn't expect Google
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.500]   to do anything but what an evil company does,
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.660]   which is make money, and to expect any more of them
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.340]   is on the case and I quote Umer Hake and others
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.740]   and say, "Well, no, nowadays doing evil is bad business."
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.140]   And because we can all talk about you
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.260]   and we can all things can happen
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.540]   and you're gonna be screwed if you do evil
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.340]   and that's why Google's don't do evil,
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.220]   a pledge is not a matter of grace from God.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.860]   It's a business decision to say that if we do evil,
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.380]   well, we're gonna screw ourselves.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.220]   - Well, this is that you're now in the test case.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.620]   - Yeah, we sure are, man.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.460]   We sure are.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.780]   - And here's the, as users, I think we all wanna stand up
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:48.100]   and say, you know, if we care
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.900]   and we care a lot and let's see if we can influence
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.080]   this company and keep it on the true course,
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.100]   I'll be very disappointed.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.940]   - So what do we do then?
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.340]   I mean, the problem is, you know, boycott Google now.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.340]   - Well, I'm willing to boycott Google.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.340]   You know, there are choices out there.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.660]   - You know, I don't like boycotts as a rule.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.380]   I think it's more about what we say in Google does a lot
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.460]   that is good and I still basically like what they do.
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.380]   I just am baffled by this.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.300]   We should say, by the way, that we did invite on Google
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.340]   and Google PR was looking at trying to get someone
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.500]   on the show and they didn't.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.500]   - And we'll leave that door open.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.340]   That's possible.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.180]   I'd love to hear it.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.620]   I know they listen to the show.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.820]   I'd love to hear their response.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.300]   And I'd love to use this opportunity to influence them
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.460]   in the direction that I know that probably Larry Page
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.460]   and others would like them to go in.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.820]   I think there are a lot of people within Google
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.660]   who believe firmly in net neutrality across all platforms
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:50.140]   who believe firmly in privacy and in doing no evil.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:55.140]   And is this maybe Google's sitting at a joint,
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.820]   you know, fork in the room?
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:57.860]   - No, I think you're right, Leo.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.100]   One thing I say that this versus other companies
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.300]   is that at least Google asks and as a result,
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.860]   it defines evil every day.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.420]   - Well, and that's what they said about this document,
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.620]   by the way, they said this is not,
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.780]   this was a private document.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.460]   This was none of these, some of these were non-starters
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.300]   to begin with.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.020]   It wasn't even showing to higher level executives.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.300]   It's just discussion points.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.220]   And I think it's appropriate for them to discuss this.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.740]   I don't, you know.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.700]   - Well, Chinga, let me try one on you.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:24.340]   Was not giving Wave the fair shot evil?
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.700]   - No, I didn't think it was evil.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.580]   I didn't, I can see it on the Wave front.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.180]   I can see that Wave didn't have the users
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.140]   that they wanted, that they expected.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.820]   It didn't reach milestones, it didn't perform.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.660]   So they killed it.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.420]   I didn't think it was evil.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.260]   My question for you, Jeff, is this China compromise
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.860]   again, all over again?
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.540]   So you kind of gave Google a pass right at first
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.140]   for being in China, and then they changed their mind
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.900]   later on, because you said, well,
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.340]   they're getting some information there.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.580]   And so, I mean, can we look at this the same way?
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.900]   - No, no, I was on the side.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.460]   I was on the social media, I was on the side
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.780]   that said they were wrong to go in China,
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.620]   I don't know those circumstances.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.980]   So I was glad when they stopped censoring.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.780]   - But did it trouble you the same way that this,
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.940]   see, that didn't trouble me as much as this does.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.900]   Does this trouble you more?
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.420]   - Yeah, it does, because it's the heart
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.540]   and essence of the internet.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.660]   China was a case where I think they found that
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.540]   they put themselves in a stupid position.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.420]   They violated their own standards to make the business,
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.140]   they were dealing with people they couldn't trust,
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.860]   it came back to bite them in the butt,
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.340]   and then they used principle to justify getting back
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.940]   on the track where they should have been in the first place.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.540]   And I'm glad they got back on the track.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.460]   Fine. - Right.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.980]   - In this case, in this case,
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.300]   and what you just said, Leo, about,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.820]   well, Larry and Sergey believe in net neutrality
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.780]   and believe in privacy, we think.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:49.100]   I want them to believe in this because it is good business.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.780]   Because-- - That's the only thing
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.300]   that will keep that belief going forward.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.740]   You can't do it in the, you know,
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.460]   you're not gonna give up profits in the long run,
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.260]   you are a publicly held company.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.380]   You have a fiduciary responsibility to your stockholder.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.060]   - Well, I want them to be smart enough to do that.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.780]   Well, that's why I push entrepreneurial journalism,
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.940]   because I don't want to be a charity,
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.620]   I want it to be a sustainable business.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.660]   I want the internet to be sustainable and successful.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:08.500]   - And frankly, that's-- - And frankly,
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.940]   the reason I got that about AT&T
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.420]   going to blockades was because it was gonna limit use
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.700]   and use more use is what makes the internet grow
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.460]   and goop knows up better than anybody.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.220]   - And that's the only reason I've ever had any faith
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.740]   in Google is because it made sense from a business point
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.020]   of view that they support net neutrality
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.780]   and privacy and all these things, that they do know evil.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.780]   - Okay, so if we move from a wired world
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.940]   to a wireless world, let's try to just,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.020]   'cause again, I honestly try to figure out
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.540]   what could Google's business rationale
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.980]   for what it did this week be.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.420]   So if we move from a wired world to a wireless world,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.860]   Google sees that's where all the money is.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.700]   And Google is antagonistic with all the carriers.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.020]   Well, they're kind of screwed in their business, right?
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.820]   Because they can't sell, even though they got a free OS,
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:55.220]   thank you very much, we're gonna use it
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.700]   to try to limit it as much as possible,
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.620]   limit your chances to make money as much as possible,
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.860]   which was wired's argument.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.460]   Is that what's this behind?
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:07.700]   I mean, did the idea of defending the internet stop?
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.580]   And in fact, mobile isn't the internet,
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.820]   it is the Schmidt internet and it's all new rules.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.420]   - So what is evil?
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.740]   Somebody's asking in the chat room,
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.600]   what would be evil?
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.820]   Using the information Google knows about us against us.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.660]   - Sure. - Not protecting our privacy.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.620]   - Not looking out for us in terms of usage.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.460]   - Net new to put nuts.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.700]   - Yes, serving corporate interests instead of users.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:34.540]   - Right.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.860]   - Period, not furthering the open internet,
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.060]   not supporting the open internet.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.620]   - That's what Google's whole thing, open internet.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.660]   - That's what Google started,
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.020]   it's founded its business on,
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.020]   that's what is good for its business.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.820]   And that's why Jeff keeps asking that question,
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.380]   why Google, why?
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.260]   What is the business case for what you've just done
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.260]   with Verizon?
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.140]   - Maybe it gets it further,
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.420]   I mean, maybe it gets it enough of a base.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   So when this becomes a real issue,
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.260]   and I know it is an issue today,
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.580]   but when it starts really hitting home for people,
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:12.580]   then maybe they'll have the influence to step up
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.860]   and actually act.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.700]   I mean,
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.340]   - Yeah, could it be they're playing a lot?
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.740]   Could it be they're playing a longer game?
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.300]   - That's why I raised the idea of the Munich Accord,
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.660]   and the problem was the Sudan land just went to Germany
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.820]   and without Czechoslovakia at the table.
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.340]   And it didn't work out very well,
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.740]   Mr. Chamberlain passed the summer class
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.820]   to the Netherlands version.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.420]   Yeah, yeah, so Stacey, I could,
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.940]   but they're too smart for that.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.820]   They know that they sit at the table
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.060]   with the double phone companies.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.140]   They're the ones who went in the spectrum auction
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.140]   to push openness.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.820]   - That's right, they were in this on the side of the angels.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.060]   What happened?
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.380]   I wish they bought that spectrum and opened it up.
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.020]   They compromised there too, by the way.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.020]   Of course, I can't blame them for saving
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.700]   three and a half billion dollars or four,
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.540]   four point nine billion, but nevertheless,
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.540]   another opportunity missed.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.180]   - All right, all right, so is this the week,
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:09.140]   should we mark it?
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.980]   The Google stopped being not evil?
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.060]   - It took us just over a year, yeah.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:15.900]   (laughing)
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.740]   - This is the test.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.260]   (laughing)
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.420]   - I am feeling you very much like a filthy lover.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.500]   The most colored glasses I've fallen on.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.220]   - You know, we used to be the big, you know,
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.380]   I used to be the guy that said,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.420]   "No, I trust Google because it's in their business interest
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   to be trustworthy."
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.060]   And they're clearly not,
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.420]   they're playing some other game now.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.500]   I don't know what it is.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.380]   - I know. - Somebody suggested earlier,
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.940]   I'm not endorsing this idea,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.620]   but we should change the name of the podcast in--
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.740]   - This week in evil.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:41.580]   - Protests.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.700]   This week in cloud.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.540]   - We could do that, actually.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.020]   - That you can open internet.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:50.820]   - Yeah, you know, look, there's no question in my mind
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.780]   that every single person listening to this show,
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.420]   every single person who cares about technology,
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.740]   wants an open internet.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.860]   The only people that don't want an open internet
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.580]   are commercial forces that want to capitalize on the internet.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.700]   They want to, they balkanize the internet.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.220]   They want to use it against us.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.460]   It's very clear, I don't see any gray there,
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.940]   it's black and white, isn't it?
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.260]   - And the one party we had the faith
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.220]   that saw that in its interest,
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.820]   so our interest were aligned, was Google.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.100]   - We're gonna rename the show this week in Bing,
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:21.940]   somebody said.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.220]   (laughing)
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.940]   - I'm gonna start to cry any time ago.
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.580]   We have to go to commercial.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.100]   - All right, we're gonna go to commercial.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.580]   Stacy, I know you have to run.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.820]   - Thank you so much for being here, Stacy.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.980]   - Thank you, Stacy, it was great.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:36.780]   - Stacy Hagenbottom writes for gigaohm, g-i-g-a-o-m.com.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.340]   And if you go to gigaohm.com,
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.220]   right there on the front page,
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.180]   you'll see a link to all of Stacy's articles.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.100]   And I like net nerds, so we'd love to have you back
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.740]   if we may, Stacy.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.580]   - Thanks, Stacy.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.380]   - I'll let you be back.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.220]   - Next time, when your power is out, we can--
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.220]   - Yeah, I can't.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.140]   Get some air conditioning.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:57.460]   - Yeah, of course, Stacy's in a minor power outage,
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.940]   but her my fire is surviving.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.780]   - Thanks, Stacy.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.620]   - You're on my side, I--
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.460]   - Oh, it did?
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.300]   - All right, thank you.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.500]   - All right, well, take care.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.180]   Well, thank you for joining us and--
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.500]   - Is it Verizon?
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.820]   (laughing)
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.660]   - It is.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.420]   (both groaning)
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.100]   - Gonna be something you wrote.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.780]   - Thanks, Stacy.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.580]   We'll talk to you again very soon, I hope.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.020]   Take care, bye-bye.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.860]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.700]   We'll come back.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:24.540]   There is more Google news.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.820]   In fact, there's a mysterious announcement tomorrow
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.140]   from Google will get speculation
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:31.260]   from our guests, our panelists, our hosts, Gina Trapani,
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.940]   and Jeff Jarvis in just a minute
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.940]   before we do though, I wanna thank our friends at Ford
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.820]   for the support they've shown this show.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.300]   And in fact, the support they gave us to go to Detroit
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.580]   last week, we had such a good time.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:48.580]   I am a Ford fan, I use that incredible Ford Sync.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.740]   It's in my 2010 Mustang,
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.620]   and if you wanna know more about Ford Sync,
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.500]   go to SyncMyRidepodcast.com, that's the website.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.820]   It is the true hands-free calling, and by the way,
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.500]   works especially well with Android.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.500]   I don't wanna say anything, but...
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.100]   - And it is really sweet with Android
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.340]   because for instance, on my Droid X,
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.060]   Sync reads my text messages.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.740]   It just says, "See them coming in."
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.860]   Reads them out loud in a lovely female synthesized voice,
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.500]   which can be make for miles of merriment,
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.660]   depending on who's writing the text.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.940]   You get turn-by-turn voice directions, true GPS,
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.220]   without having to purchase additional hardware.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.740]   911 Assist, which is great.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.220]   I just repaired my Droid X with the car
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.540]   'cause I did that reboot last week, that reset,
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.380]   which by the way, fixed all the problems I was having
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.980]   with the lag on the Droid X.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:41.220]   And so I had to rebond it and it said,
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.380]   "No, make sure you want the 911 Assist on
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.220]   'cause it's not on my default."
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.580]   And I said, "You bet."
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.820]   That's when the airbags go off in the car.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.860]   The car uses your...
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.380]   This is what's kind of interesting about Sync
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.420]   as opposed to other things like OnStar.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.780]   It's using your phone.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:00.140]   So Sync gets better as your phone gets smarter.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:00.980]   It gets better.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.860]   So that's a very interesting idea.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.220]   It's kind of a partnership between the technology
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.180]   you bring into the car and the car itself.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.220]   So if the 911 Assist is a good example,
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.980]   it'll call 911, gives you an opportunity to say,
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.540]   "No, forget it, I'm all right."
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.700]   But if you don't respond, it calls 911,
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:19.700]   it feeds the GPS coordinates from your phone to 911,
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.140]   and then plays a recorded message
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.620]   and then turns on the microphone and the phone
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.660]   and gives you a chance to speak.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.500]   Help me!
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.780]   Great for the...
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780]   Okay, that's the kind of...
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.700]   That may be a little bit more,
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.580]   but there's also some positive stuff.
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.780]   You can play podcasts just by asking for the name.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.460]   The whole idea is you never take your hands off their wheel,
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.300]   your eyes on the road.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.060]   So it is safer.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.220]   Traffic alerts, weather, movie times,
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.060]   and so much more.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:43.900]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.820]   Here's a couple of ways you can do it.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.540]   Go to the website, SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.780]   There's some great videos there.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.580]   You can take a look at.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.660]   Or, maybe easier, just go to your favorite Ford,
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.980]   Lincoln and Mercury dealer and test drive.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.940]   I love my 2010 Mustang.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.220]   I'm looking at the 5.0, the new 2011 Mustang,
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.220]   and thinking, "Hmm."
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:08.060]   And Jennifer, I showed her the flex.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.860]   And now she wants to trade in the Toyota for the flex.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.180]   So we may become a Ford family.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.780]   You know, it's kind of neat when you go to Detroit
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:18.780]   and you see American workers in a really high tech plant,
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.340]   it's got a living roof.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.380]   It's got seat 'em on the roof.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:23.940]   So it absorbs the water.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.060]   I mean, and they have solar.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.580]   It's really neat to see, you know,
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.380]   what is considered one of our oldest industrial companies
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.180]   move into the 21st century so aggressively.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.940]   And you gotta give Ford props for that.
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.580]   SyncMyRidepodcast.com
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.260]   or your Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicle dealer today.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.660]   So let's see.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.620]   What do you think tomorrow?
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.340]   Now the latest I'm seeing is that it might be
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.660]   an Android announcement.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.580]   New Android feature coming tomorrow.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.420]   - No, I think we're gonna hear
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.020]   that Google is now a paid service.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.700]   (laughing)
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.140]   - A penny a search.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.500]   Hey, we gotta make some money here.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.500]   The Google blog posts,
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.940]   according to Google spokesperson,
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.740]   it's a small event.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.100]   - It is a mobile event though, isn't it?
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:10.940]   - It's mobile, yeah.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.220]   They say it's gonna be Android, a mountain view.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.820]   Is it a new app?
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.060]   - So this is kind of odd, right?
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.580]   Because Gingerbread's not supposed to drop
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.620]   until next quarter, right?
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.860]   So we've still got some time for that.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.260]   So it's not gonna be Gingerbread.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.300]   Most likely it'll be an app
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.980]   or a new feature functionality.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.820]   - Is this typical?
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.980]   - I think it's not a simple last time.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.060]   - Do they do this typically?
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.740]   They have an event?
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.500]   - The last event like this,
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.420]   they announced turn by turn directions.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.900]   That's what Gizmodo said.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.180]   So that's a good feature.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.020]   - That was huge.
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:41.860]   - That was huge.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.100]   - Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty cool feature.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.860]   So I'd love to see something like that.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.660]   The first thing that came to mind was the streaming music
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.180]   that they talked about at Google I/O,
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.740]   which I kind of assumed would come with Gingerbread,
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.340]   but it was during the Froyo demonstration.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:58.300]   And that was that you'd be able to purchase music
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.180]   through the Android market.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.740]   And I think even stream music from your desktop,
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.820]   that would be pretty neat.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.220]   So I don't know if there's gonna be--
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.780]   - That's what I thought.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.860]   I thought this was the month
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.500]   that we're gonna announce Google Music.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.780]   - Yeah, like a Google Music app, right?
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.260]   That lets you stream and so so that.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.100]   - Oh, okay.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.100]   That could be--
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.180]   - That'd be my guess.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.260]   I don't know, what do you guys think?
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.620]   - That sounds right.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.460]   I'm gonna put my money in--
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.540]   - That's the service like that, yeah.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.500]   - Yeah, Google Music.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.580]   We knew they were gonna announce that.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.740]   It would be an Android app, of course, that makes sense.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:26.740]   - Yep.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.900]   - Okay, I'm going for it.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.660]   - They have, they have,
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.660]   so if I media, Vic did that demo at Google I/O in May.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.260]   So, I don't know.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.020]   I mean, what else could it be?
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.700]   It's not Gingerbread.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.740]   I mean, we know it's not Gingerbread.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.980]   - That's 3.0.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.420]   - Dell Street came out, or it was coming out tomorrow.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.340]   Maybe they'll show the street.
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.180]   I'm excited about the street.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.580]   I think I'm gonna run out and buy one.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:57.580]   That is a seven inch Android 2.1 based tablet from Dell
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.580]   that is priced below the iPad,
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.700]   of course, it's a smaller screen.
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:02.860]   - Seven inch or five inch?
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.700]   - Is it five?
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.140]   I'm sorry, five.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.580]   Yeah, seven is what the rumors are
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.140]   that Apple's next iPad will be seven, it's five.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:12.260]   You know, the 4.3 on the Android X or the EVO
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.380]   is almost iPad like.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.340]   I get even a little bit more, it might be enough.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.820]   It's interesting, I wonder,
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:23.140]   this is by the way why I really like the Google space
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.300]   for phones versus the Apple space for phones
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.860]   'cause you know what happens at Apple.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.580]   Somebody makes prototypes of the iPhone in, you know,
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:34.020]   3.5 inch, 4.3 inch, 4.8 inch, 5.4,
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.220]   but make, you know, the whole range.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.060]   Steve comes in there all on the table, Steve looks and goes,
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.060]   yeah, let's do that one.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.180]   And that's it.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.660]   There's no discussion.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.980]   There's no consumer testing.
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.180]   They don't ask anybody that Steve goes,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.460]   that's the one we're gonna do.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.900]   Versus-- - There's no data.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.220]   - There's no data.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.580]   And I admire that, I love that.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.260]   I'm a big fan of the O-Tur principle.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.820]   You know, I like the idea that some great thinker
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.140]   with vision can do something.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.140]   But I also love the idea that, you know,
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.780]   anybody can take Android and put it on any size they want it.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.980]   However stupid it is and let the market decide.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.180]   - And you could go to a store,
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.980]   that same table is there with all those choices
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.660]   and you get to decide. - You get to decide.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.500]   - That's it.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.900]   That's the thing, you know?
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.300]   I just, that's the difference right there in my mind.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   That's choice.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.100]   And who wants a carrier
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:23.100]   humping net neutrality surrender monkey to choose?
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.660]   Oh, I'm sorry, that's the wrong company.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.060]   Plastic Logic is killing the, I'm sorry,
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:28.780]   I just love that phrase.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.700]   In fact, that's going to be the title of the show.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.540]   You know this.
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:35.020]   Plastic Logic has killed their Q-Reader, which everybody--
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:36.460]   - They earned it.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.620]   - They earned it.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.060]   The Q-Reader, everybody was excited
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.940]   about this Kindle killer,
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.940]   just shows you how hard it is to Kindle the Kindle.
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:49.340]   In fact, Amazon is reportedly working on other devices.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.060]   Amazon wants to be in the hardware business apparently.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.340]   More, come on, the more the merrier, that's great.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:59:00.100]   If you were in Russia, you might have been a bit
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.420]   by a Trojan in the Android marketplace since removed
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:07.420]   that steals from you by, it's an SMS Trojan
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.820]   that sends messages to a paid service
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:13.020]   and you get the bill for hundreds of dollars,
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.340]   premium rate service.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:18.740]   Just a word of warning, it's not out there anymore.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.260]   We should mention Ted Stevens passed away,
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.380]   died in a plane crash.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:27.380]   Sean O'Keefe, the former head of NASA survived, thank goodness.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.300]   Senator Stevens, known in the cloud circles
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.660]   for coining the phrase, the internet is a series of tubes.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.300]   It's kind of sad that that's how he's gonna be remembered.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:44.180]   South Korean police raided the Google office.
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.460]   This is again the backlash
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.060]   on this Street View collection, I think, right?
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.500]   - Yeah, it is Street View and it's gonna start
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.220]   up again in Germany, Google's about to start
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.660]   to go Street View again in Germany.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.300]   Did you see the other great story this week?
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.460]   Viewshafts VOCA, otherwise known as Vivo,
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.940]   the business week of Germany reported
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.260]   that Google was buying photo drones
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.380]   and the company that was selling them was bragging about this
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.060]   and it was doing no one any favors
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.700]   because the drones were shown focusing on a woman
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.660]   in a bikini on a blanket and then looking
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.940]   in the windows of houses and all kinds of things
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.060]   that got picked up or sold around.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.100]   So I pinged Google PR and it was a Saturday
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.420]   so they couldn't do it on a Monday, first thing I heard.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.900]   No, no, no, no, that was eight, the company did not buy them,
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.060]   is not looking at them, eight executive at the company
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.580]   bought one of these to experiment with it.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.300]   - Well, I'd like to experiment with it actually.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.500]   - That's fun.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.220]   - I'd like my own predators.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.700]   - That all on Ireland, I think I put this in the feed,
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.060]   on Ireland local governments are using Google Earth
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.860]   to find illegal pools.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.140]   - Yes, I thought that was hysterical.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:52.980]   - Yeah.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.300]   - So is this combination now you imagine the droid,
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.340]   I mean the drone rather or the droid drone,
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.900]   perhaps it'll come to that, can look and find
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.580]   illegal deck construction or something.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.940]   - Well, I hope that there's a student at UCSD
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.100]   who has developed, Arturo Flores has developed a program
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.500]   that removes people from Google Street View
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.940]   automatically and quite effectively.
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.860]   I didn't realize this, apparently according to this article
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.460]   in Tech News Daily, Google Blurs, people's faces,
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.260]   I never really-- - In Germany you have to, yeah,
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.100]   it's more than the other one, brother,
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.180]   it becomes part of this.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.900]   What I loved about this story Leo is if you look at the picture
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.820]   on the left and the person is gone,
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.660]   but the dog with the leash is still there.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.100]   (laughing)
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.300]   - I think it's a very, I really hate this,
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.260]   'cause I think it's, remember the neutron bomb,
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.860]   it filled people up the buildings intact?
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.220]   This is a neutron bomb version of the world
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.780]   because we're also scared now, no, don't show me.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.300]   - I'm in it. - I'm walking down a street.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.540]   - Oh no.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.100]   - What could happen, folks, what could happen?
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.740]   And it presents a very strange view, I think,
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.100]   of now we have streets filled with little ghosts
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:58.940]   that are up there.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.780]   (laughing)
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.140]   - No, it's not under, you know, and by the way,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.620]   the other thing that happens is sometimes the shoes are there,
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.700]   which reminds me when I came through the wall,
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.860]   what World Trade Center ran up to the planes hit,
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.180]   the mezzanine was filled with nothing but shoes
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.460]   as people ran out of them, it's really, I don't like this.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.260]   - Yeah, yeah, I don't wanna see a world
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.980]   with just shoes and leash dogs.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.100]   (laughing)
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.380]   - A couple people in the chat room are suggesting
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.380]   that maybe Google me will get announced tomorrow,
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.460]   but I don't think that's gonna happen,
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.940]   it's definitely a mobile event,
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.220]   and I think Google me will be another whole other thing.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.540]   I think, I don't think that's gonna be just a small event.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.300]   - We're in agreement. - Can we now imagine?
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.140]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.660]   - Well, you're gonna say the same thing.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.500]   - Go ahead.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.740]   - We're in agreement that Google is doing a me,
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.380]   a Facebook thing.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.780]   - I'm pretty sure, I had a long conversation
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.460]   with a former Googler who shall not be named,
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.940]   and there's definitely a social product that's getting built,
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:58.420]   and it's kind of a black hole in terms of engineers
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.180]   from all over the company,
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.620]   kind of getting pulled to work on it.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.620]   - And they never emerge.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.860]   - And so, it's a big secret.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.260]   I mean, no one knows what's up.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.020]   - Really, I like that.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.460]   - Well, I don't think we do executives.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.300]   - What's his name is,
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.540]   Vinz who was in charge of mobile?
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.900]   - It's Vin Gunatra, right?
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.740]   - Vic. - Vic.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:18.580]   - Yeah, Vic.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.420]   - Yeah, Vic.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.580]   - So, Gina, didn't you hear that Vic was assigned to this as well?
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.580]   (sniffing)
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580]   - There was a story to that effect.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.420]   - Oh no.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.980]   Oh, was there?
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:30.580]   - I didn't hear that specifically.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.420]   - Yeah.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.380]   - But I believe that Rick Clow,
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.420]   who we were gonna have on the show,
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.260]   has been to do with it,
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.660]   'cause I think that this new social product
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.700]   has to do with profiles,
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.020]   and I think that he wants to come on the show
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.620]   when this product is.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.460]   - And what did he say?
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.540]   What did he say, September?
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.100]   - He said, "When I have something to talk about."
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.220]   (laughing)
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.540]   - He was very careful.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.420]   It was Liz Gaines writing in Gigahome,
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.940]   Google's social czar is Vic Gunatra.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.020]   He is officially,
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.340]   well, he's the guy who did the keynotes at Google I/O,
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.220]   and did so well, I thought.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.340]   - Yes, very well.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.420]   - Google was looking to the outside for a head of social.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.700]   Did apparently hire a recruiting firm.
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:16.260]   However, ended up giving the nod to Vic.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.220]   - Vic is a good bet.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.700]   He's charming, developers like him, he presents well.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.780]   - And he's technically good bet.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.620]   - He's got big things.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.260]   He's not a marketing guy.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.340]   - Yeah.
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.700]   - Been there since 2007.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.140]   He's relatively new there.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.020]   - Well, let me ask you this,
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:35.620]   because Google has now left the Nexus One behind,
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:39.700]   and we see nefarious motives in that,
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.100]   does this mean that Google will never do a pad?
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:46.020]   - Oh, because they said,
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.140]   Eric said they were gonna do that
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.940]   at that famous party in Los Angeles.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.780]   - Right.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:50.620]   - We would do our own pad.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.460]   I don't know why.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.060]   - I think Eric talking with a German accent.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.300]   I don't know why.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.820]   - If you're to a pad, yeah.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.460]   Why is that?
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.300]   Is that, no, no, no.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.620]   - I don't know.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:05.100]   When Cara Swisher wrote about my internet internet post,
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.860]   she didn't understand the Yiddish joke that was there,
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.660]   and said I was actually making a play on Eric Schmidt's name,
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.500]   which I wasn't doing.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   - Oh, internet schmooly.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.340]   - Internet schmooly.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.180]   - Internet.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.340]   - It didn't even occur to me.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.300]   (laughing)
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.980]   - How are you all, how I feel about him?
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.780]   - So I think this whole thing is just my really music.
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.140]   - Cara's such a wasp.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:23.980]   - Is she a wasp?
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.820]   - I don't know.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.500]   - She's such a wasp.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.660]   - So I thought of the other one was the other one.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.580]   I said, I can't give her examples.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.820]   I said it's like Cara Schmara, Jarvis-Marvis.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.660]   - Right.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.060]   - And Verizon for Climped.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.480]   (laughing)
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.300]   - And there is our Yiddish expression for the day.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.140]   Any other stories before we get to our tip and tool
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.780]   and deprecated number of the week?
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:46.620]   - No, wait a minute.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:47.700]   I'm a second number.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.540]   - Go ahead.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.380]   - A slight gmail rollout this week.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.220]   - Oh yeah.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.060]   - A little design.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.500]   - I didn't want to say it 'cause I thought maybe you'd,
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.940]   I don't know, mention it.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:56.860]   - Yeah, well, yeah, I don't really have a tip related to it.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.620]   I'm actually a little dubious about it.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:02.580]   We kind of re-ended some of the links on the top left side.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.940]   It puts contacts and tasks above the compose button.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.180]   So tasks is really high up on the left side,
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.780]   which is interesting 'cause it's still just
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.500]   this little pop out product.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.780]   You know, it's like on one hand,
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.500]   it's like, oh, there's a commitment to tasks.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.340]   And on the other hand, it's like,
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.700]   it's just a little pop up.
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.700]   - I should show that it has all these phone numbers in there.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.380]   - Whoopsies.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.060]   - It is cleaner and there's a little more
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.140]   room for your messages and the contacts section was big,
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.740]   was really, was overhauled and is looking much better.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.860]   - Yeah, that's a big change in contacts.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.780]   - So it's one of the Gmails.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.700]   Yeah, it was one of their Gmails weaker points.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.180]   So I think that they're definitely improvements in contacts.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.340]   And this, it's a reason,
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.220]   it hasn't rolled out to Google Apps accounts yet
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.340]   'cause they're saying that they want to do a little more
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.500]   work with contacts.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.180]   And I think that probably has to do with grouping contacts
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.820]   on your domain and that kind of thing.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.020]   But hopefully our app users, we app users,
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.700]   we'll see that soon.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.300]   - Gina, yeah, just this is off topic here.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.340]   But I just saw on Twitter, usually Leahy asks,
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.020]   how come nobody has talked about ORCIT
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.580]   moving to using Google Wave codebase in UI?
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.420]   - What?
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.260]   - Is that going to happen?
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.940]   - No, that's a joke.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.100]   - Oh, not that I know.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.940]   - Is that a joke?
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.020]   - It's got to be a joke.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.180]   I lost the irony, sorry.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.980]   - Maybe not, I don't know, let's go.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.020]   ORCIT's gonna start looking like Wave.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.140]   Let me see, I'm going to ORCIT right now.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.500]   (laughing)
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.740]   - This is someone from England, they have irony.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.500]   You know, some from New Jersey, they have no irony.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.900]   - Yeah, I think that's the problem.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.620]   I don't really see Wave becoming merged
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.260]   into the ORCIT codebase anytime soon.
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.660]   - I'm actually still not really clear on what waves,
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.140]   you know, what's gonna happen with Wave.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.540]   Is it gonna, I mean, I know that novel
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.700]   has that pulse product, which is based on Wave.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.780]   I'm not sure, you know, where else it's gonna live on.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.620]   - It's gonna take over Wave and make it live.
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.540]   I mean, it's open source, right?
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.940]   Or is it open source?
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.620]   - Much of it is open source.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.620]   I, from what I understand, not all of it is open source
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.300]   and like decoupling parts of it,
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.540]   some of the most crucial parts from the Google codebase
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.340]   was kind of a, was a challenge.
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.220]   And I don't know that they've done,
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.180]   I don't know that it's a totally standalone
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:07.300]   run your own server product yet.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.500]   And they're not developing anymore,
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.900]   so I'm just not sure if that's possible, you know,
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.580]   so once they're, hey, we'll, can't just people
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.380]   install it on their own server and run with it?
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.660]   And it's like, it just hadn't quite gotten
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.260]   to that point yet.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.420]   So, yeah, the outlook is grim.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.860]   (laughing)
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:24.700]   Fortunately. - Aw.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.300]   - All right, let's get our tool tip
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.100]   and the number of the week starting with you,
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.900]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.820]   - A quick tip for Android users,
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.340]   this week, and this comes from Kevin Pirthy,
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.420]   who's writing in the book on Android.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.220]   You can hang up phone calls by hitting the power button.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.860]   So you don't have to hunt for the button
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.900]   on your touchscreen.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.220]   You can set this up in the accessibility settings.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.220]   If you go in Android, into settings and accessibility,
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:52.300]   you just check off, use the power button to hang up calls.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.140]   So if you're doing something or driving or something,
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.780]   you can easily, you know, hang up your phone call
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.100]   without having to, you know, hunt on the touchscreen
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.980]   by just tapping the power button.
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.820]   - Very cool.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:06.980]   - JF charms.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.780]   - Well, I got a thanks to the Twitter people.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   I got some numbers, so I'll use them real quickly.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.020]   The few numbers are interesting.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.140]   They're out about broadband.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.620]   And this one, I'll highlight this as well.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:22.500]   In 2009 to 2010, the percentage of white Americans
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.100]   who have broadband went from 65 to 67%,
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.420]   which is a leveling off of speed.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.500]   But among African Americans went from 46 to 56%,
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.780]   which is a huge growth and nears, you know,
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.780]   starts to narrow in on the digital divide,
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.740]   which I think is very good news.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.060]   That's one number.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.460]   Another number is of course,
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.980]   129 million, 864, 880.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.180]   We know what that is.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.700]   - Oh, say it again?
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.340]   - 129 million, 864, 880.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.020]   The number of wave users who are now on our foot.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:54.860]   I don't know.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.700]   (laughs)
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.900]   That's the number of books that exist
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.980]   in the world Google says.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.980]   And they're gonna let us scan the ball.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.820]   Two more real quick.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:03.900]   One is 129.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.380]   That is the number of blogs that TBD.com,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.860]   a new political, local service in Washington, DC
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.940]   is working with in their network,
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.420]   which is the way to do it, folks.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.260]   I wanna give a call.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.580]   - Tell me about TBD, 'cause I've been reading about that.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.620]   What exactly is it, the post?
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.060]   - No, no.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.780]   It started by people who used to be the post,
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.220]   Jim Brady, who used to be the online editor,
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.540]   now working for Politico,
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.700]   and Albrighton is starting a new local service
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.060]   that launched this week.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.780]   That is doing all things right.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:33.100]   It's policy is in my favorite line
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.340]   from bumper stickers near you.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.100]   Do what you do best, link to the rest.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.860]   If somebody else does it well, they'll just link to it.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:43.420]   They are working with 129 local bloggers
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.660]   and sending traffic to them,
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.180]   and making them the store, which is the way it goes.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.260]   - Not like the Huff Po, or is it like the Huff Po
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.060]   where they kind of put the bulk of the article there,
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:52.900]   or is it?
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.580]   - No, what they do is if you get a blogger
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.780]   and the network has a really good article,
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.980]   they will promote the hell of it
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.660]   on the homepage of TBD and link directly to the blogger.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.500]   - That's smart.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.340]   - Not the blogger at the site.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.260]   - That's very smart.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.100]   - I think it's really good.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.380]   And finally, the last number of the week, of course,
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:09.540]   has to be 19.75, the number of hours per week,
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:13.540]   but the now fictional Spencer spent on farm films.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:14.380]   - The hope of.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.220]   (laughing)
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.980]   - I put the link up, and we all see now
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:20.980]   that it's an actress named Elise, and it was a hoax,
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.220]   but it was such a wonderful hoax.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.180]   - You know, I have to say, when I first saw it,
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.380]   I had no thought in my mind that it was a hoax.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.620]   This is the woman who, it was 33 whiteboard things
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.740]   where she quit her job and then outed her boss
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.740]   as being a complete farmville junkie.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:39.100]   All because he called her an HPOA.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.940]   And which I'd never heard of.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:41.780]   - I hadn't either.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.620]   - Yeah.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.380]   - Honestly, you know, I had never heard of her.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.060]   (laughing)
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.340]   - And it was a creation of two brothers who do
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.220]   thechive.com, and they've done it before a couple of times,
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.780]   and fooled the mainstream media.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.940]   I loved it that it was Tech Crunch that they wanted to fool
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.340]   and did in fact fool with that story.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.660]   And then it was Tech Crunch that outed the actress.
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.620]   So.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.140]   - I also love the fact that it got,
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:08.940]   as great, quit moments go, it got upstaged by
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.300]   the guy from JetBlue.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.500]   - By the JetBlue guy.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.900]   - It was real.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.740]   - It was real.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.580]   - Right.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.420]   - Although. - We think.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.180]   - Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was real.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.300]   (laughing)
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.220]   You know, it's hard to say, you know,
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.460]   of course he endangered, it was a,
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.380]   you know, you don't do it.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.900]   But boy, what a great way to make an exit.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.980]   And I hope, I'm actually having an exit slide
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.380]   built into the studio here, just in case.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.020]   And I got a couple of beers and a special break glass
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.020]   in the case of emergency.
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.580]   - You're not gonna grab your cell phones
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:38.420]   and slide out.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.260]   (laughing)
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.660]   - You're gonna put this whole cell phone.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.980]   - It was a little bit of a screw you, Mike Harrington moment.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.300]   I kind of had some sympathy overall with him.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.180]   It's one of those things you do,
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:48.700]   it feels good at the time and you deeply regret.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.220]   But, but, and boy, he's gonna benefit.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.260]   - You gotta laugh about it after.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.100]   - Oh yeah.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.980]   I mean, and this guy's a, he's a hero.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.980]   He's a hero.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   He's a robin.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.820]   - He's gonna make a fortune.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:58.660]   He's gonna make a fortune.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.900]   There'll be TV shows, speaking engagements.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.180]   He can pay for the slide.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.020]   - Yeah.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:03.860]   - Yeah.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.420]   (laughing)
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.100]   - I have one little plug.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:07.940]   - Yes.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:10.220]   - I have one little plug this week.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.780]   I'm doing a new video series for a fast company.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.580]   Doing kind of a tech help Q and A.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.300]   So I'm doing personal Skype consultations
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.820]   for folks who have questions about Google,
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.500]   cloud, personal productivity, software,
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.340]   whatever questions you want.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.660]   So if you hit my blog at smartaware.org,
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.580]   submit your question.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:30.220]   If we, if we choose it, we'll record a little Skype Q and A
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.700]   video action and it will publish it on fast company.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.060]   - And of course, if you'd been reading my pulse blog,
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.860]   you would have known that because I immediately
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:42.020]   bookmark that in pulse and that's my tool of the week.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.340]   And this is a Android app,
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.500]   although it is also an iPhone and iPad app.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.380]   And as I was traveling around,
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:50.580]   I use it quite heavily to try to pull stories for the show.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:55.260]   Pulse is a really awesome news reader that,
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.940]   you know, we talked a lot about Flipboard when it came out.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:00.100]   This is predated it, but I think does a nice job.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.500]   And they've recently added a feature where you can,
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.580]   you can heart something, any story,
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.620]   and it will add it to a postrous blog
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.740]   that it sets up for you automatically.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:12.500]   And you can then follow people's postrous pulse blogs.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.940]   I'm having trouble getting to mine right now.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.300]   I don't know if it's down because I've just sent everybody
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.620]   there or what, but I have one.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:24.100]   It's leoloport.pulsememe.com.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.340]   And that's actually one of the first stories
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.300]   I, I bookmarked on there.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.580]   Gina was. - Awesome, thank you.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.380]   - Yes, was that video series you're doing.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:34.660]   'Cause I think that sounds really, really cool.
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.620]   Pulse is a dollar 99 in the Android store.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.940]   You know, I have to say one thing that's really become clear,
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.340]   a bunch of big Android applications came out,
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.180]   big name applications that have been on the iPhone
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.580]   only in the last couple of weeks.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:50.460]   It's very clear that developers of portable applications
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.340]   are no longer seeing the iPhone as the only platform
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.380]   that they realize you have to do it for Android
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.300]   if you're gonna do it.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.460]   And so anybody who is saying,
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.620]   oh, you know, I wanna use Android except that XYZ
[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:03.460]   isn't on it, I think those days are now gone.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460]   I can't think of a single major app.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.380]   - That was pretty quick too.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.020]   - Yeah. - For the time,
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.660]   Android came out to that, didn't take long.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.180]   - Big ever node update.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.540]   There were a couple of apps that just came out
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.340]   that were iPhone only for a long time,
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.380]   I was very pleased to see.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.060]   And click set, and I haven't tried it.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.540]   I was gonna make it my recommendation,
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:19.860]   but I haven't tried it yet.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:24.660]   Click set just put out Android and iPhone apps.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.060]   Click set is a kind of a friend feed replacement
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.460]   that I've been on for a while that a similar idea,
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.700]   it collates all of your social media
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.900]   into one Twitter style stream.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.540]   And they've got 70 services,
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.820]   it's kind of an amazing real time thing.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.140]   They just released an Android app.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.140]   And I would have recommended it
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.780]   except I haven't had a chance to really play with it yet,
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.620]   but I suspect I'm gonna be doing that a lot.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.100]   And then there's one other app that I've been using
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.620]   in conjunction with Four Square,
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.620]   it's called Pick Please, P-I-C-P-L-Z.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.380]   And it allows you to do a Four Square check-in
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.380]   with a photo, which I really like the idea
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.340]   that you do the check-in with a photo
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.140]   'cause it just gives you a kind of this neat visual
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.420]   of what people are up to.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.260]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.260]   - Yeah, a lot of times when I--
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.100]   - That is the kind of the kind.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.740]   - Yeah, and then you can see what people are up to
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:18.500]   by location as much as by the person you're following.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.740]   And so they're trivial photos,
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.780]   it's what I'm eating or what it's,
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.300]   but I think it's a lot of fun.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.980]   I used it quite a bit while I was touring around,
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.220]   and I think I probably will use it more and more.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.420]   And it's on the Android platform as well.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.660]   And I don't think it's on the iPhone,
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.940]   I haven't seen it on the iPhone on the platform.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.300]   So there's a few recommendations,
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.220]   it's hard to just pick one when it comes to Android.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.980]   We love downloading those Android apps.
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:42.780]   There's SFO, there's my son on the plane.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.460]   There's my son waiting for the plane.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.540]   You know, a lot of times they're silly,
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.660]   I don't even know what that is.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.380]   Oh, that's somebody else, okay.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.300]   There's Hyde Park had a beautiful time
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.580]   at, that's the Vanderbilt mansion.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.780]   - Oh, that's a beautiful mansion.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.620]   - Have you been there?
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.900]   - Incredible, I love that area.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.140]   - I went to school nearby.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.460]   - Oh, you did?
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:02.220]   - I did, I went to school in Poughkeepsie.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.300]   - Oh, you went to Vassar?
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.300]   - Marist.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.340]   - Marist, okay.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.700]   - Yeah, the other Vassar.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.700]   - The other Vassar.
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.620]   (laughing)
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.100]   One next door.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.380]   - That other school, it's a beautiful area.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.180]   That Hudson River Valley is just spectacular.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.340]   - Or just, in the fall, there were just a few weeks
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.220]   where you just sit on the river and look at those leaves,
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.180]   it's beautiful, good frabby, art is great.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.820]   - Abard has this great art museum
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.140]   where I took a picture of the,
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.940]   they have a white flag flying over the museum
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.620]   that says, "Please don't kill us."
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.460]   (laughing)
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.300]   I don't know what it means, but I love it.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.140]   And the pictures.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.140]   - The pictures, I saw you tweet that.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.620]   And I was like, "What is Leo talking about?"
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.460]   - What is he talking about?
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.220]   - Well, that's the pic, please, right?
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:45.260]   So, anyway, that's another fun one.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.060]   P-I-C-P-L-Z.com.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.260]   All right, everybody, we're out of time.
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:50.420]   We're way over time.
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.060]   Thank you very much, Gina Tarpani,
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.860]   smartawear.org, that's the place to go
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:55.940]   for Gina's great posts.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:58.980]   She's on Fast Company and lots of other places as well.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:01.460]   And of course, that Fast Company video series.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.020]   If you go to, where's the best place
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.780]   to go to that for that again?
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.860]   - Just go to my blog, smartawear.org.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.100]   You'll see where to email,
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.420]   you're in your question, your submissions.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.860]   - It's a great idea.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:11.700]   - And we'll get it going.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.180]   - Wish I'd thought of that.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.500]   (laughing)
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.940]   - I wanna be Leo when I grow up.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:16.780]   Are you kidding?
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.900]   - You are, you're better than me.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.380]   All righty.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.300]   But you don't have, you don't have this.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.980]   This is a dog collar that tweets for your dog.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.580]   (laughing)
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:26.420]   - That's it.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.260]   Until I have that dog collar, I am never,
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:30.060]   I'm never, I'm really, oh.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.860]   - Leo, I dare you to wear it.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.060]   - I was thinking, you know,
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.980]   why would I, should I, I'm a dog tweet?
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.660]   I'm gonna, I'm just gonna put it on.
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.740]   (laughing)
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.900]   - Now you need a dog collar that takes photos
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.780]   while you walk and sends them to pick the use.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.380]   - You know, the minute that's available,
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.820]   guess who's gonna buy it?
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.100]   - Leo, then you'll sound just like Craig Newmark's
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:49.940]   Twitter feeds.
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.100]   - Swell, swell, swell.
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.820]   - Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmajean.com

[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:28.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.220]   (upbeat music)
