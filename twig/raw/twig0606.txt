[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Coming up next on this week in Google, Leo's out for the week.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.080]   So I, Jason Howell, I'm filling in for Leo.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.040]   We're here with Jeff Jarvis, Stacy Higginbotham and Ant Pruitt.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.280]   And we got a whole lot of Google to talk about this week.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.040]   Google is the ultimate warrior in the battle between Google and Oracle.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.680]   We talk all about that case in the Supreme Court decision that decided it.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120]   Google I/O 2021 is near.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.480]   Suddenly we know all about it.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.720]   We've got details for you.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.160]   Stacy reviews the Nest Hub 2.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.960]   That's the one with sleep tracking.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.640]   I go hands-on with the OnePlus Watch.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.080]   They're new wearable.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.280]   It's coming out soon.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.720]   Pixel 6 is supposedly going to have Google's White Chapel chip in it.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.080]   And so much more that we talk about next on this week in Google.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.600]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.120]   From people you trust.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.960]   This is great.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.520]   This is Twig, this week in Google.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.960]   Episode 606 recorded on Wednesday, April 7th, 2021.

[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.160]   Hello everyone.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.960]   I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo Laport.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.680]   I like to say these Galavanting, but I think he's Galavanting in the Petaluma area,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.840]   or at least the Sonoma County area.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.960]   Still Galavanting.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.120]   He's probably doing it in a Galavanting sort of way, but happy that he's taken a break
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.560]   and enjoying himself and happy that it means that I get to join the crew today.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.000]   So I'm happy to be here.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.960]   Joining us as always, we'll start with you, Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.800]   Or I can go for the super long the Leonard Tau Professor for journalistic innovation
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.160]   at the Craig Neumard Graduate School.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   Neumard!
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.360]   Neumard!
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.720]   The University of New York.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.560]   I knew that was coming and I didn't do it.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.520]   Why did nice sing it?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   How you doing, Jeff?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.560]   All right, how are you?
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.440]   Glad to have you here.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.360]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.480]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.040]   Also joining us when returning after a week away is Stacey Higginbotham,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.480]   at StaceyAnniot.com.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   What's up, Stacey?
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.320]   What's up?
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080]   I'm in a good mood today.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   I can't wait.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.520]   I know.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.320]   I know.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.960]   Loving it.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.680]   It's like lifting the collective energy, too.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.440]   That's what happened to me, one of us.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.120]   So it's good to see you.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.240]   Good to have you back.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.800]   And then also joining us from, well, nearer to me in real life than anyone else on this
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.200]   podcast panel is Ant Pruitt, twitter.tv/hop and all other things,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.520]   Twitter.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.080]   How you doing, Ant?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.480]   Unbelievable as always, sir.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.200]   How about you, Sam?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.800]   I knew you were going to say that.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.080]   And then I knew you were going to wink.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.760]   That's like your thing.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.040]   You know, unbelievable as always.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   And then you wink.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.120]   It just makes me feel so good.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.560]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.280]   I'm doing well.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.200]   It's good to be here.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.680]   And we've got some Google stuff.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.440]   Actually, actual Google news, actual Google news that we can talk about today.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.000]   Big news.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.920]   But you know, kind of scrolling through, we might end up talking a little bit about Facebook.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   I'm sorry, Stacey.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.600]   I don't know.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.840]   It's OK.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.680]   You know, it might happen.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.120]   I will persevere.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.160]   You cannot kill.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.360]   You bring it her down.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.640]   Sorry.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.200]   I don't want to.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.960]   I don't want to bum you out.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.760]   But.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.960]   Harsh my buzz, man.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   Don't want to harsh your mellow.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.080]   I suppose we should start with the story that I only realized when I was kind of setting up the
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.520]   doc for today's show.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.760]   I completely forgot to put this into last night's rundown on all about Android.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.400]   Totally an Android story.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.000]   Sort of, I suppose at this point.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.920]   But definitely a story that's been in the Android world for more than 10 years.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.400]   Google has won officially in the Supreme Court in its case against
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.600]   Oracle.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.680]   This is the case that had to do with copyright claims.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.840]   Oracle was claiming Oracle stated and improved that Google had Java code in the
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.960]   Android operating system code a decade ago.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.760]   Like I said, Google, of course, claiming fair use.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.120]   Supreme Court ultimately sided with Google on this.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.640]   Reversed an earlier appeals court decision that Oracle had won in its favor, I think, two times.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.560]   So this is just one of those cases that just like never goes away.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.080]   We talk about it for a little bit, then we forget about it.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.520]   And then like four or five or six months later, it appears again.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.720]   And it's appeared again.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.320]   Is this the end of this story?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.840]   Are we at the end of this arc?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.120]   Yes.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   Because the only thing you can do after the Supreme Court rules is take your toys and go home.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.560]   And Google is basically that we'll have some petty fighting maybe back and forth.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.880]   Like Google being like, yeah, Oracle, you know what?
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.640]   We're no longer using your software.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.480]   But really, this was such a huge news.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.880]   Like Monday morning, I woke up.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.960]   I was stoked because it was after Easter and I was probably still on a sugar high.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.240]   And I saw this and I was like, oh, this is amazing.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.320]   And my husband thought it was actually going to be exciting.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.720]   And I tried to explain to him how not copywriting APIs basically enables the entire service-oriented
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.600]   like tech economy that we have today to exist.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.640]   And he was just like, Stacy, it is copyrighted.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   They didn't decide copyright.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.240]   They decided fair use.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   Yes.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.680]   Fair use.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.160]   You're right.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.800]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.520]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.000]   You'll never hear that again, by the way.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.560]   Sometimes.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.880]   You're in such a good mood.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   I'm like, yes, Jeff, you're right.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   Wow.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.680]   Wow.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.080]   It is copyrighted, but it's fair use.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.640]   You can do this.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.160]   But this is huge for like--
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.960]   It is huge.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.440]   The way we work today.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.400]   I mean, think about it.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.640]   Like, just I as an IoT person.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   Every item in my smart home uses APIs to talk to other things.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.120]   You have to have access to these things.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.280]   And this lets you control them, but it also lets people use them, which without like,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.160]   onerous terms.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   So you can't have oracles step it in the middle of innovation and say,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.640]   Hoopah!
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   Pay them a toll.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.120]   So.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.000]   I'm paying me.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.040]   You got a lot of--
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.360]   And I think--
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.960]   The other thing that makes me happy about it is--
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.120]   because they did kind of dodge copyright.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.880]   And we'll get back to whether software can be copyrighted later as of now it can be.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.520]   But I think that they use that open for a fight for another day,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   which probably could be good news.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.920]   But just as creative as we all are here, it also is an endorsement of fair use.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.400]   And that's important for all of us.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.760]   That's important for you showing videos on these shows or for us
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.160]   acting as critics of things.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.560]   It recognizes the core of copyright, which is that it's meant to spur creativity.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.960]   So the strong endorsement of fair use, which Larry Lassick once said,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.280]   fair use is just the right to hire lawyers.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.800]   It's never going to be clearly defined, but there's an endorsement of it here.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.920]   And that made me feel good.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.080]   And finally, it feels really good to see Oracle as a jerk company getting kicked.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.440]   Jason, you asked if we were going to hear about this again.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.200]   It seems like we all heard about it when it was about vacation time for what's his name, McAfee.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:49.880]   But this was-- I thought this was good news because I talked to a employee at Google.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.960]   He brought up-- I'm not going to say his name, but he brought up some good points and
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.040]   said that, yeah, there were a lot of things brought up in this documentation that
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.000]   made it look bad on Google, but this is still just for the better of everybody.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And like you said, far is fair use in being able to use certain things in our content creation as
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.600]   we are content creators.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:18.760]   And I believe Ms. Stacey mentioned something regarding, hey, we can be petty with Oracle.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.040]   I think they've already started that because they're going to step away from a particular
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.440]   accounting software or something and move over to S&P.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.120]   I want to say I saw that the other day.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.560]   Yep, they're getting rid of Oracle.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.600]   Just, yeah, okay, we were nice to see what this went on, but yeah.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.920]   Be gone, Oracle, be gone.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.680]   No one likes Oracle.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.160]   I'm going to S&P.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.920]   I mean, find me someone who likes-- even my friends who work at Oracle don't like Oracle.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   It's hard.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.960]   Your friends are all hiding right now.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.040]   No.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.000]   There are two good threads in here, Jason, that I thought were really good.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.720]   One by Amak, Alex McElbury.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.600]   I think one thing we owe some thanks to Google in this case is everybody wants to slam the big
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.560]   platforms.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.320]   Google spent-- God knows how much.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.080]   It spent 10 years fighting on behalf of all of us in favor of this fair use.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.240]   And Amak says that it was 10 years ago when he was part of the team of lawyers who had
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.760]   privileged to work on number one, book searches fair use, number two, DMCA protects YouTube,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.960]   and number three, Android's use of Java APs is fair use.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.760]   And that they fought these things and good for them.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   They didn't fight them out of the goodness of their heart, though, Jeff.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.880]   No, but they could have given up.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.400]   Like I think folks are lately and it gets burdock in Australia.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.240]   I think they're less likely to defend the internet as well because they're--
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.760]   They did start this back and they do not be evil era.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.720]   Yes.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.360]   Yes, well--
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.720]   So this was the 2013-2012.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.360]   I think the appeals case was 2014.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.440]   So they started the case before then.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.080]   Right.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:09:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.960]   I mean, it was a full decade ago.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.280]   This has been one of those 10 year cases.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.320]   Crazy, crazy stuff.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.520]   The other really interesting thread here was pulling up here, Matt Schroyer's,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.320]   about the notion of interoperability and that there was a flip here.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.120]   Let me see if I can get this right.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.920]   That the active supporters were Oracle and the Sun and Microsoft was,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.880]   I don't know so much because I don't want to be interoperable with us like Oracle was with Java
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.800]   and that interoperability won here, which is really important too.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.000]   Just Stacy can put that better than I can.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.920]   I had to stop listening to you because I was being talked to by John.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.800]   Okay.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.720]   Yes.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.440]   Interoperability, Stacy, like it or don't.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.640]   Good or bad?
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.240]   Oh, pro interoperability.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.120]   Okay, there we go.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.560]   It's like, do you appreciate kicking puppies?
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.800]   No.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.760]   So Oracle when it was down had been in favor of interoperability,
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.200]   then it turned and went against it.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.720]   But in the end, it won and Oracle lost.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.040]   It was on the wrong side of history.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.280]   Oracle said in response to this, they said,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.960]   they stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.080]   This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.400]   are examining Google's business practices.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.120]   Take that Google.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.640]   Bitch or bit or bit or a little bit or, I mean, you spend a decade fighting for your side
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.360]   and you lose.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.400]   You're going to be a little bitter.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.800]   I have a feeling anybody would come out the other end and be like,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.440]   yeah, that's how I felt about net neutrality in 2018 or 2017.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.320]   Don't worry.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.200]   It's coming back.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.080]   It came back around.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.360]   That arc is turning for the better again.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.040]   So there we go.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.520]   Cool.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.160]   Google wins.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.280]   Happy to get that on one of the shows.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.040]   I don't know how I missed it last night.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.840]   We had all sorts of other great, you know, like, important.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.280]   Because you're probably trained to say, oh, the Google Oracle story.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.480]   Oh, God, it's still going on.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.240]   You know what, honestly, right?
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.200]   You're probably right.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.600]   Of course it is.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   Yeah, you're probably exactly right.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   Because when I saw this headline, I was like, oh, my goodness.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.520]   How many times has this story come up and I have to like kind of rehash it again and go through the,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.960]   you know, all the twists and turns and it's important.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.760]   Well, Jason, I didn't see Twitter go berserk the way I thought they would have.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.240]   I thought Twitter would go crazy with this.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.520]   Twitter went nuts on my feed, but I have the cloud feed.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   You saw it.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.200]   Oh, my Twitter didn't so much.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.680]   My Twitter was absolutely quiet.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.920]   Heck yeah, APIs.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.520]   There's there's the differences.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.640]   Yeah, she's on IOT.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.160]   I'm on infrastructure Twitter.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.120]   Right.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.080]   And I'm in the regular people Twitter.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's always infrastructure week for Stacy.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.040]   That's right.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.480]   Indeed.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.520]   Isn't it for all of us?
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.440]   I'm sure if your Twitter went nuts over that news, then are they going nuts?
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:19.400]   Over Google I/O 2021, we actually have information and it's no, it's not an in-person Google I/O.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.720]   So it's virtual, which I mean, we kind of expect, right?
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.680]   Like at this point, like, you know, it's what is it next?
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.040]   At least we're having one last year.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.520]   There was none.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.880]   Exactly.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.200]   Right.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.560]   Last year, it didn't even happen.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.600]   They had planned to have it and then, you know, you could cite a number of reasons
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.560]   why it didn't happen.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.760]   You know, there was a lot of social unrest happening at that point.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.880]   I think this was, I think that was like post, like almost immediately post the George Floyd
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.200]   incident, right?
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.600]   Somewhere around there where Google was like, no, no, it was George Floyd.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.200]   Yeah, it was that.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.000]   It was pandemic.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.720]   It was a number of things and they were like, yeah, maybe it's, maybe having a celebratory
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.960]   conference at this point is not a good idea.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.720]   So they postponed it indefinitely.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.920]   So we're getting it May 18th through the 20th.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.240]   It's going to be virtual, free to attend.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.520]   Of course.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.480]   I mean, I'd be surprised, I suppose, if it wasn't, but free for everyone.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.120]   Everyone can go this year.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.680]   Everyone.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:25.560]   You can all go to the virtual Shoreline amphitheater online.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.000]   Bring your sunscreen.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.760]   We're going to take a drive down there, even though it's virtual.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.920]   I don't know.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.160]   There might be a handful of other people that show up.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.000]   They're like, what Google is happening right now?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.480]   Where is it?
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   I feel like y'all could do this is a great opportunity for a twig branded background.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.040]   Go out there, take a photo of the amphitheater so people can set it as their virtual background.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.600]   So you can.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.160]   There you go.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.360]   Brilliant.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.120]   Hey, that's a great idea.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.640]   Love it.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.920]   They're going to have a consumer and developer keynotes.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.840]   So, you know, talking products, talking features, sounds like the, you know, the general
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:06.120]   ideas is very similar to what you get out of a normal Google I/O just compressed into
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.560]   three days.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.720]   Although three days is about what it normally is.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.520]   Anyways, right?
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.640]   When it's out of a shoreline.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.040]   Yeah, it is.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.920]   Three or four days.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.440]   Four days maybe at the longest.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.240]   So, yeah.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.040]   I'm curious to see how to do the actual opening keynote because you know that's going to be
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.920]   pre-recorded.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.880]   There's no way.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.240]   And you see what Apple and Microsoft have done with those opportunities to try to
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.400]   really, really make them in depth and captivating to the audience.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.840]   And not just really bore you to death with a bunch of slides.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.880]   So, I'm curious to see what Google would do with its googliness to make this an interesting
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.800]   conversation.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.680]   You know what I would love to see?
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.720]   Let me just dream big for a second here.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.000]   So, I have Google Nest audios.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.480]   I have Google Nest displays.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.840]   I've got my pixel.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.640]   I feel like how fun would it be to be able to tune in on a couple of these channels and
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.360]   have like, I don't know, different camera angles or different things kind of happening.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.160]   When they're fun, in Google, is this type of company who would think like that?
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.200]   I think that would be cool.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   So, I am sure they're not going to, but like, oh, my Nest audios, I could have them behind me,
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.720]   and they could be like, crowd noises or can't get in the last year.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.520]   That's just so.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.040]   So, what's your wish for IO?
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.280]   What do you want out of IO?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.160]   What do you want the room to announce?
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.680]   I would like actually, I'll go first.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:43.960]   I would like Google to talk about smaller machine learning chips.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   So, bringing actual machine learning to the TensorFlow, the TPUs are big, right?
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.400]   They've got TensorFlow Lite.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.840]   I think it could be smaller and better.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.640]   So, I would like for them to make some big waves there and make it easier for normal
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.800]   people to use in maybe train.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.560]   That would be really neat if you could train your like, train.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.200]   Train.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:10.760]   So, like, imagine if I could do NLP, like, I could train my devices for my voice or my
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.440]   wake words.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.280]   That's something that's within grasp actually from a technical perspective.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.160]   And then the other thing I really would like is much more information about local
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.760]   processing.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:28.600]   And if I'm thinking super Google nerdy, I want something on the distributed side.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.280]   So, like, how we can actually start getting, even if it's on their database side,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.360]   so it's on their side, but eventually it could come to us,
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.120]   is getting devices to really share computing loads across networks in a way that
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.960]   is a little bit more flexible than it is today.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.000]   You mean the sample?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.920]   So, like, this is a crazy example, but like, my phone and my Google displays
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:04.120]   might decide amongst themselves which one will do the processing for hearing my voice.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.040]   That's a really easy one.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.440]   I like that.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.480]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.840]   But it could also be like, yeah, it could also be like, Stacey really does these,
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.640]   like, I need to borrow some compute power for some machine learning to do some hyper personalization
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.520]   for Stacey's house.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.080]   Let's, you know, the middle of the night, no one's using these displays,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.200]   and she's not using her phone.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.840]   Let's combine all that compute power to do some quick training.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.560]   And then poof the next morning I wake up and I've got better stuff.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.680]   That's, we're getting there.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.520]   You're on the Stacey neural network.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.960]   Yeah, it's like,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.760]   Personal neural network.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.920]   People are already like, there have been companies that have put like early,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.200]   which is a highly distributed programming language on like light switches,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.880]   so they can do that within the walls of the house at various times, right?
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.440]   But we really need someone to take that sort of thing mainstream,
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.240]   and that's, I don't think that's going to happen,
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.600]   but it'd be really awesome if it did.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.840]   Still trying to understand what I want.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.600]   So, so take the, take the light switch as the example,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.720]   because that already exists.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.400]   What, um, like, what does that result in?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.920]   Like, so it could learn things.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.520]   It can learn it like, okay, there's, and there's different layers.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.880]   So if it's only light switches, maybe it just learns exactly.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.120]   It does, it learns exactly what someone's schedule is, right?
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.840]   Oh, I see.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.320]   I see.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:21.800]   Okay.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.160]   The other, like the next layer is once these things start,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.040]   once they're a common frameworks for things to talk to each other,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.360]   it actually could talk to my phone and let's use the phone as a proxy for me,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.600]   even though it may not be because I may not carry it with me.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.680]   But if you use my phone as a proxy for me,
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.920]   then you have this additional piece of information that says,
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.760]   hey, Stacy's right here.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:48.200]   Take action on this and, uh, so it's, it's, it's pulling in more data to learn from,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.400]   and possibly react.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.440]   And you can do a lot of this you can do.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:59.880]   It just happens, like, over periods of weeks, as opposed to every day,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.560]   um, and like an ongoing kind of.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.240]   And a lot of companies say things like, oh, we do personalize machine learning,
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.120]   but they really don't.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.840]   They have a cookie cutter base.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.800]   Well, they, they, they, they, they're, they're really just doing machine learning
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.160]   across all of their customers.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.600]   And then they're like, they process it every like two weeks or a month.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.320]   And then they're like, they do a software update to everyone that's like,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.200]   Hey, we're better now because it, and that's not bad.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.880]   I mean, that'll be things like, Hey, we recognize dogs now on our cameras,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.200]   because we've trained on everybody's dog.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.120]   But how much cooler could it be if it were, if you have that computing power
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.640]   that that could use locally to be like, Hey, your stuff isn't going to the cloud,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.440]   but be we recognize your dog.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.320]   So when that raccoon runs into your dog door, we're going to be like,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.400]   Holy cow, Stacey, there's a raccoon in your house.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.800]   Got you.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:49.960]   Right.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.680]   This is a fear of actual, actual personalization.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.320]   Right.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.960]   Not marketing personalization.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.120]   Right.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.400]   Right.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.240]   That's interesting.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.280]   Get into it. Not Kylo.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.680]   For, for you.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.960]   Right.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.480]   I don't know.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.240]   So you know what I want looking forward to, but Jeff, what do you, what do you want?
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.280]   You, you know what I'm going to say.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   No, I don't know.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:12.680]   I don't know.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.560]   My is obvious.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:13.960]   I want.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.160]   Oh, oh, gee, sweet.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.640]   Say chrome book of some sort.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.040]   Right.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.080]   I was thinking chrome book.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.880]   I want to pick some mobile network connectivity.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.280]   That's, that's the standby.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.960]   But you want to know, you want a new pixel.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.560]   If we did, what do you change the new?
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.600]   You want to go back to the name?
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.280]   What's that?
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.120]   Stacey said G-suite.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.160]   Didn't they?
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.280]   Oh, sorry.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.600]   No.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.160]   Um, whatever, whatever the Google thing, like your, your issue with Google's.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.240]   Enterprise or whatever.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.640]   Thank you.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.120]   Enterprise.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.640]   I'm not giving up Stacey.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.040]   You can have a process.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.840]   You have a business.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.400]   So, so.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.160]   Quitter.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.040]   We will later get to chrome changes.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.640]   And I'm trying to do the new changes.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.240]   And of course, so I can't do.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.960]   And I don't think we explained why.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.160]   It has the strange, strange little logo.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.680]   That it's a box with a, with it with a cross in it.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.680]   And then another box over to the side.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.840]   I tweeted this and I said, what does that even mean?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.200]   Huh.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.040]   I guess it's an office building.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.080]   And if you're enterprise.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.720]   No, it's don't.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.640]   It's don't wash in hot water.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.400]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.920]   Stacey is impish today.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.800]   Yes.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.280]   Yes.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:26.680]   Yes.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.000]   Yes.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.040]   That's great.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.840]   So you're right, Stacey.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.520]   I would love that, but I've given up.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.080]   I've given up.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.560]   Okay.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.000]   But.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.160]   Aunt Jason, what do you want?
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.680]   Well, you had, you had mentioned Pixel.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.040]   Like the only thing that really comes immediately to mind,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.840]   because I'll be completely honest, I kind of forgot about Google I
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.240]   of this year.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.000]   Like I was truly surprised by the announcement.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.800]   Like really?
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.240]   That's right.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.480]   It is normally next month in Google I know.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.080]   Well, Jason, I used to run a booth.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.720]   Exactly.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.680]   I missed that.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.520]   I missed the, the in-person thing.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.600]   And, you know, have lunch with you.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.280]   And everybody else that we see, like,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.320]   that whole experience.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.800]   I'm really looking forward to hopefully next year,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.160]   we return to an in-person I.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.560]   We'll see about that.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.720]   But yeah, I mean, I think the things
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.840]   that I look most forward to at Google I/O,
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.200]   probably because I'm more of a product person than I am a developer.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   I'm not a developer at all, are kind of the product.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.520]   How the product announcements, yes.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.280]   But also how kind of the developments on the development side of things
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.440]   tie into those products and make them even better.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.880]   If, and I know you said, Jeff, that, you know,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.120]   maybe a Pixel announcement of some sort.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.960]   If there is to be one at Google I/O,
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.600]   it would be a, I mean, if the previous couple of years is any indication,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.040]   it would be one of the A series.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.480]   So it would be, what would that be?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.520]   The Pixel 5A 5G?
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   Or maybe not even the 5A 5G to make it even more confusing.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.040]   It might just be the 5A.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.000]   And then later this year, we get the 5A 5G and the 6.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.760]   Who the heck knows?
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.240]   I don't know.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.440]   I'm already confused.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.560]   But, of course.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.000]   But maybe, maybe we'll hear something like that.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.440]   I'm sure there will be some sort of a producty thing there.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.640]   I'm just not certain.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.760]   I know exactly what it is.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.160]   Well, they were talking about for...
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.640]   Anything you want?
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.480]   My wish list is really a shot in the dark.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.960]   And they probably won't do it.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.360]   But I would be curious to see if they come up with a TikTok-like
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.800]   piece of software the way everybody else has done it.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.160]   They already have everything in place with Google Photos.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.560]   And they've added those extra updates to the video side of things.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.000]   And why not just continue to put something else out there?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.280]   Because that's all you ever do.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.520]   It's just throw stuff out there to see if it sticks.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.480]   And just see how googly it would be.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.760]   But I doubt they'll do it.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.360]   I wouldn't be...
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.000]   I'm trying to remember if YouTube already has...
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.080]   See, I've lost track because everybody's talking about it.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.200]   Yeah, see, that's YouTube shorts.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.080]   This one thing.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.960]   YouTube shorts, that's it.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.280]   But I'm thinking outside of the world of YouTube,
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.160]   just something built right into photos.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.120]   Like a separate app.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.000]   Right.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.280]   Built right into photos.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.760]   Because photos has the capability to do all of these different animations
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.560]   and filters and stuff that it does via machine learning.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.160]   And it mashes up little video clips for you already.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.880]   Why not let the user have a little bit more control?
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.320]   And do their own thing the way the likes of a TikTok
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.760]   or Instagram real stuff.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.200]   Would that have a social component to it?
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.960]   I feel like photos is less of a social app more than a...
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.200]   Yeah, but even with photos,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   those things are shareable to those other applications via a link.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.480]   I see.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.640]   They're using photos to create the media
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   and then sharing it out to a social network you want.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.000]   I could see that.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.440]   Photos has a lot of that capability of,
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.880]   like you said, creating in interesting ways,
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.280]   different types of genres of media creation stuff.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.080]   So I could see that.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.040]   I don't think they don't have to do it.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.560]   So when you register,
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.920]   you can put in the question you would ask Sundar.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   Oh, that's right.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.960]   Do you want to ask Sundar?
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.800]   How are you going to make money when search is done?
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.720]   How hard do you want to make?
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.640]   That's the biggest Google X-ters...
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.160]   It's a substantial question.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.400]   What replaces search?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.000]   See, me, I would ask him,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.720]   how is he going to really get leadership to focus?
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.560]   Everybody is so siloed there in that organization.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.920]   We talked about it before.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.200]   So what can he do as the head to get everybody to focus
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.560]   and just stay on course with whatever the product is
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.480]   and not do all of this bouncing around stuff?
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.360]   But that question, that prompt in the signup process to get
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.760]   whatever a virtual ticket for Google I/O,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.440]   took me by surprise.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.640]   I was there for like 10 minutes.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.880]   I was like, "God, you got to put in your Twitter handle
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.680]   if you want to do this?"
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.520]   It's got to be a good question.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.800]   Like, what if they actually pick it?
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.440]   I think I ended up coming up with,
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.320]   I don't know if it's like a softball question,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.840]   but I just was curious to know,
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.040]   Facebook's...
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.160]   Is it Bosworth had said,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.040]   you know, the next 10 years of kind of personal media device
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.480]   dominance won't be smartphones.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.120]   It's going to be wearables, glasses, watches,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.000]   that sort of stuff.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.640]   I'm curious to know what Sundar believes.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.440]   Like, is the next...
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.360]   You know, if the 2010s were defined by the smartphone,
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.640]   as they have been,
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.040]   what are the 2020s and beyond?
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.120]   What is the next paradigm that we have yet to discover?
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.920]   Highly distributed, continuous computing.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.000]   [sniffling]
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.960]   Such a nerd.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.440]   [laughing]
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.320]   Such a nerd.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.920]   I'm telling you, just you wait, y'all.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.800]   You're going to be living it,
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.280]   and you'll be like, "Oh, this is what Stacey was talking about,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.480]   but I barely understood it."
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.160]   She knew what she was talking about.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.880]   [laughing]
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.520]   She's too hyper and a little incoherent.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.000]   That's okay.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.760]   [laughing]
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.640]   We'll see.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.200]   I wonder, like, at what point we'll know,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.840]   like, who's...
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.240]   Like, what is that setting up for?
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.600]   Is that setting up for Aquino?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.880]   Where Sundar Pichai answers these questions live for everyone?
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.400]   Well, they have to answer questions now,
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.480]   because they did it, right.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.920]   So, but they can pick them.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.720]   Yeah, yeah, they'll cherry pick, of course, yeah.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.440]   Jason, from Petal Loomis House.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:38.920]   He did.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.400]   That's right.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.560]   Exactly.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.240]   Exactly.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.120]   And then we're talking about the pixels,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.080]   so we might as well mention this,
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.200]   and then we can take a break here.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.360]   The Pixel 6.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:57.800]   And actually, the Pixel 5a5G might actually be powered by Google's homemade
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.240]   or internally made white chapel chips.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.800]   So this is their first kind of mobile phone,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.280]   or mobile device specific system on a chip.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.880]   They're creating this in collaboration with Samsung.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.520]   This would be the first time their own silicone goes into their,
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.640]   or silicone goes into their pixel devices.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.440]   Pushing out Qualcomm, which has been there since the beginning with pixel devices.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.680]   And, of course, very similar to what Apple's been doing with the M1.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.320]   And yeah, I don't know.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.640]   I'd be interested to see how, like, what that affects,
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.000]   what that changes with the Pixel 6 compared to the 5 and before it.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.680]   It actually changes cost of things, right?
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.960]   Well, it also changed the ability to, like, put things,
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.560]   like, when you have your own silicone, you can pop accelerators on there,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.240]   like Apple has done, for example, for their wearables and devices.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.120]   So they could do that.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.400]   It might reduce costs because you're not paying,
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.920]   yeah, your bag, they'll still have an arm license,
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.320]   but they probably won't have the Qualcomm fees.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.480]   And it could be good across the board.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.520]   If they're working with Samsung, then you could have all Android phones
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.280]   working from the same silicon, which means you could put things
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.200]   on the chip in OS and tie those very closely together.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.120]   That could actually lead to, like, better security.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.200]   So that was easy.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.800]   What does that do to the companies that use Android without their chip?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.560]   Well, LG got out of the mobile phone market.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.720]   So how many of them?
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.680]   How many of them?
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.000]   How many are left?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.520]   There's Huawei, there's...
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   Well, Samsung, that's how it means.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.800]   Well, this is Samsung they're working with, though.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.920]   So the story says they're co-developing it with Samsung.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.760]   So Samsung has their own econos chips.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.440]   So if Whitechapel is Google plus Samsung,
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.520]   that the largest provider of Android,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.280]   just basically is going to become vertically integrated,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.280]   which gives them some good Apple-like features.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.360]   Yeah, except the fact that a lot of Samsung's,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.680]   well, all of Samsung's premium flagship devices and...
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.560]   Our Qualcomm.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.360]   And below our Qualcomm, at least in the US,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.560]   and that's just a huge percentage of Samsung's device.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:30.680]   And Samsung has worked really a long time to get and develop Exynos.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.320]   And to put the...
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.800]   I mean, they've been working on Exynos chips for, like,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.080]   I want to say, like a decade.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:42.200]   But the other thing to think about is when you develop your own chip,
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.680]   you have to have a huge volume of devices,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.960]   and pixels are not that.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.320]   So Google could actually,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.640]   actually, credibly do this alone, but they do have...
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.000]   Oh, good point.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.960]   Good point.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.360]   Okay.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.240]   Yeah, very good point.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.040]   So, I mean, they have to have Samsung.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.600]   I mean, I think it's a good move.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.720]   I think it's a necessary move.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.280]   It sucks for Qualcomm, but Qualcomm's already getting...
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.800]   Qualcomm's already seen this writing,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.280]   so they're definitely focused on other areas,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.240]   like servers, and they bought all the Wi-Fi companies.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.560]   I mean, not all the other companies.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.000]   They bought Wi-Fi business.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   They have all these other businesses now.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.960]   Anyway.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.040]   Well, yeah, and I'm guest on last night's all about Android.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.280]   We talked about this Ryan Hager from...
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.760]   Android Police pointed out,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:33.400]   Google can make the silicon that's driving these phones,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.560]   but then there's also the question of the modem
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.800]   that taps into that,
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.400]   and that can pose a bit of a challenge for Google, potentially.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.480]   Well, Apple still uses the Qualcomm radios in their phones, don't they?
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.400]   Oh, yeah, I'm not aware.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.920]   That's still their baseband processor.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.280]   Okay.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.360]   Well, let me check, but I really thought it was.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.160]   They're not using the application processor, but they are...
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.520]   Okay.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.480]   Yeah, I'm not familiar with the M1 to it.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.800]   So, yeah, they've started working.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.600]   They said last year that they're working on their own modem chip,
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   because they do still have Qualcomm in there.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.160]   All right.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.040]   So maybe less of an issue.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.120]   One of the questions that I had on this was,
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   "Is Google then...
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.680]   If we're talking about a Pixel 6 with Google's own chip,
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.000]   are they targeting a move back into the premium
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.160]   market with the Pixel 6, or are they going to stick to what they did with the Pixel 5?"
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:49.320]   And last night's guest felt pretty confident that they're going to stick in the same category
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.920]   that they are right now, and you're not looking at a return to the premium flagship
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.160]   era of Pixel phones.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:01.320]   But I suppose, yeah, that remains to be seen, but I'll be curious to see if Google kind of doubles
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.120]   down on that, because I still don't even know.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:11.000]   Like, was it a good move for Google to kind of ratchet the Pixel 5 down into the mid-range?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.080]   You know, I was pretty positive going into it, but then when I reviewed the Pixel 5,
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.840]   like I was a little underwhelmed with it.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.680]   That's why I use the Pixel 4 XL now.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   Like, I just kind of didn't see why I wanted to continue using the Pixel 5.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.440]   And so, I don't know that I'm entirely sold on that strategy personally,
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.120]   but we'll find out if that makes a difference with the white chapel.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.800]   What do you mean by...
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.320]   I'm still in the 3A XL.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.520]   But I'm still in the 3A, so yeah.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.800]   What do you mean by going, is it a cost function, or were you disappointed in like features?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.920]   Or was it laggy?
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:53.000]   You know what? When I think about it, it wasn't that there was a feature about it that I didn't
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.720]   like. It was just, I was unimpressed.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:02.760]   Like, I used it and in using it, I realized there was no reason for me to use that
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.440]   when the 4XL works just fine for me.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.840]   It was like one of the first times where I used the latest and greatest and realized I didn't need it.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.960]   And that's probably what it was.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:18.520]   Usually, I'm right there on the, you know, trying to stay along with the cutting edge,
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.160]   and the Pixel 5 felt less cutting edge to me and more like another...
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.720]   It did make slightly and much.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.800]   I still appreciate you going down this road.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.040]   I still appreciate you going down that road, sir.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.760]   That, because it's just been the whole mess of marketing, not just from Google,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   but from all of these OEMs about, hey, jump on this latest and greatest and pay a premium for it,
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:46.280]   even though nothing is really going to happen to justify that extra cost that you just put in.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.080]   Yep.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.320]   Is it a newsroom growing up?
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.280]   Is it the phones are getting boring?
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   I mean, were there features that you, like, because I feel like
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.040]   phones are kind of boring now.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.440]   I won't say boring.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.240]   I was saying that it's still made it at the time.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.120]   You know, there's only so much a phone can do.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.200]   Same with the laptop.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:16.040]   There's only so much a laptop can do before it stops becoming a laptop in terms of to an actual workstation.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:16.680]   You know?
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.840]   There are limitations.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:25.400]   I mean, and, you know, and that kind of ties in a little bit to the story that we only alluded to,
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.160]   just a little bit ago about LG, you know, basically shutting down their mobile division.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.640]   You know, it's kind of a kind of a shame that that happened,
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.280]   not because LG was producing phones that were taking the world by storm necessarily,
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:44.360]   but because LG was really doing some interesting things with,
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   they were really playing around with a mobile phone to try and see like, okay,
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.560]   everybody's used to a slab, you know, a black slab phone.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.160]   Like, let's do something different.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.760]   Well, let's bring out the LG wing that has the little screen that flips up to the side,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.480]   and sure it looks funny and goofy, but they actually, you know, decided as a company
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:09.720]   to put their marketing and their money behind that idea to see if they could stir the pot a little bit.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.600]   And yeah, phones have become boring.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.960]   They really have.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.240]   Maybe they don't need to be more than that than what they are, though, you know?
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:22.040]   I think when you go to Stacy's level of multiple devices,
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.200]   you have a blob that's your personal thing.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.560]   It goes to different devices.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:31.400]   It goes to your classes or your ears or your will I am mask or whatever.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.920]   That's when it, you know, it's personal distributed computing becomes interesting.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.840]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.680]   So who knows?
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.400]   Maybe Sundar Pichai will read my question too, I'm after all.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.560]   And then we'll know, and then we can get ready for the future.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.760]   Let's take a break.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.040]   And then actually when we get back, Stacy, you want to talk about the Nest Hub 2,
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.240]   because I know you were bummed to miss out on last week.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.680]   Oh, yeah, because I had it.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.640]   Yes, I will talk about it.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.360]   I will show it to you.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:04.680]   Awesome.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.960]   Excellent.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:12.600]   We can get your take on the Nest Hub 2 when we come back or when we return to the show.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.760]   But first, let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week in Google.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   This episode is brought to you by Melissa.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.920]   So, you know, if you've ever forgotten to check the date on a carton of milk,
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.880]   or pretty much any food that you have in your refrigerator, like milk, customer data,
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.680]   you may think it lasts forever, but it goes bad.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.040]   Eventually it goes bad.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.880]   In fact, up to 30% of customer data goes bad each year.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.240]   Melissa, make sure that your data is accurate.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.160]   Make sure that it's current so that you reach the right customers all the time.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.280]   Their tools have helped businesses maintain fresh data for over 35 years.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.560]   They've been doing this a long time.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.760]   They know they know data.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.880]   Melissa knows data.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.040]   That's why over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.840]   With Melissa, you can validate existing customer data and you can find new customers.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:08.920]   So you aren't wasting time and money dealing with all of that inaccurate customer data,
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.520]   that spoiled milk, in other words.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.760]   So you can get accurate data that helps you get to know your customers even better.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:22.680]   So you can do things like verify, you know, their addresses, emails, phone numbers, names,
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.480]   all in real time with Melissa.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.720]   And you'll see this on websites when you're plugging in and address and it gives you that
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.240]   kind of that auto fill.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.600]   It's pinging a database, often what you're looking at, that's Melissa working on the back end,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   filling that information for you, giving you that up to date, correct information.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:46.280]   Melissa's global address verification service verifies addresses for more than 240 countries
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.240]   and territories at the point of entry.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.400]   If you're tired of having duplicate customer information in your database,
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.520]   while Melissa's data matching, ultimately eliminates clutter and duplicate.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.280]   So it increases the accuracy of your database and reduces things like postage and mailing costs
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.440]   that might be associated with getting that wrong.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.440]   Get the information that completes your customer profiles better and more thoroughly.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.760]   So you can add consumer demographic information to your records,
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:23.080]   such as property data, you can insert in marital status, social media handles, that's super useful.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.520]   Melissa's flexible deployment options offer different platforms that will suit any preference,
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.760]   any business size, any budget.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:38.360]   With flexible on-prem web service, secure FTP processing and software as a service delivery
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.960]   options, ultimately that just means you can choose the best way to meet the unique needs of your
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.880]   business. Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.880]   their data security, privacy and compliance requirements.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:59.000]   So SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliant, no problems there.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.280]   Melissa's supporting communities and qualifying essential workers as well during COVID-19.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:09.480]   So you can see if your organization qualifies for six months of free service.

[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.560]   Don't put up with sour customer contact data.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.040]   Trimelissa's APIs and the developer portal.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   It's super easy to log on, sign up and then start playing in the API sandbox anytime 24/7.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:32.760]   Get started today with 1000 records cleaned for free at melissa.com/twit.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.320]   That's melissa.com/twit.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.000]   We thank Melissa for their support of this week in Google.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.760]   All right.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:46.520]   So the Nest Hub 2 and Stacy, you've had this for a little while.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.160]   You've been, I imagine you've been sleeping with this to the side of your bed,
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.520]   analyzing your sleep and giving you data that you can do something with, I don't know.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.080]   Yeah, little, yes and no.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.440]   So let's see what you can see.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.840]   So I moved it out of my bedroom.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:09.960]   So you can't see my sleep data, but you can see, like right there, it's telling you,
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.480]   I have no sleep data, but it's giving me the typical Google home screen.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.120]   Possibly in dark mode, Jeff, don't look.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.240]   No.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.400]   I'm asleep, though.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:19.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:29.000]   So I'm trying to see, one of the things I didn't like about it is you have to use the Google Fit app.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.320]   Okay, actually, let's start this whole thing off like a formal review.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.360]   Here's what we're talking about.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.480]   We're talking about this device.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:42.440]   It's a seven inch Google Nest display that sits by your bedroom,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.400]   or that they want it to sit by your bedroom because 20% of people apparently put these devices
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:52.680]   in their bedroom and Google was like, oh, I know a lot work that angle.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:43:04.040]   Normally, so it has Google's solely radar in it, and that is what it uses to track your sleep.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.840]   And it tells you, I'd show you, but right now the photos of my daughter,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.880]   so I'm not going to show you that.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.920]   When I get to a photo of something that I can show you, I'll show you how it shows
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.280]   your sleep tracking.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.240]   You opt into it.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.560]   It is all right.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.960]   I had a real issue with it deciding that I was sleeping when I was just laying in bed reading,
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.600]   and Google will tell you, no, no, it knows you're just reading in bed, and it shows you
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.240]   that, but mine actually showed me as being asleep.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:38.200]   So it also uses, it has three mics, and it uses the mics to determine if you're snoring,
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.760]   or if you are coughing.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:47.720]   What I did discover is that while sometimes I do snore, sometimes my husband snores in Google
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   can't really tell who's snoring.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.760]   It can tell that I'm tossing and turning because it only notices me, but it doesn't know who's snoring.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.160]   So that's one thing.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:03.800]   The sleeping was pretty tied to my Fitbit when it worked.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:12.440]   I will say I absolutely hated when I didn't sleep well, and Google would be like,
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.400]   you slept too much last night, or you need to improve your bedtime.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   I was like, shut up Google.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.520]   Do not tell me what to do.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.160]   I got really upset with Google.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.880]   I was not prepared for those kind of emotions that came out.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:34.440]   Partially, I think because Google, my Google is a male's voice, and I did not need a man telling
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.000]   me how I slept.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.840]   Don't man sleep.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.960]   Don't man sleep me.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.360]   I really think that was it.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.040]   I'm just like, normally it doesn't bother me that Google uses a man's voice,
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.160]   but when Google was judging my sleep, I was like, oh no.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.680]   It's super easy.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.800]   It's super comfortable.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:01.960]   If you want to track your sleep and you don't want to like spend a lot of time on it,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:08.360]   this is fine. It's not going to change the way you sleep unless you're just ready for that.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:15.160]   Just because you know you've got to go to bed at a regular time every night, right?
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   You know you got to wake up at the same time every day, but it's not like you're actually going
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.480]   to do that unless you're going to do it, right?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.760]   Google's not going to change that.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.440]   It can do things like suggest that you lower your lights, and it'll be like,
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.960]   do you want us to lower your lights at the best time for you to go to sleep?
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.000]   And you're like, no, I do not want you in charge of my life, Google.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.680]   So anyway, home control is fine.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.520]   It listens a lot better.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.320]   It sounds so much better than the original one.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.680]   There is no camera on it.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.480]   And I mean, I like this.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.920]   I put it in my office for now just because I've got to fit bits.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.000]   So I already know how I sleep.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.320]   Questions?
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.880]   Well, some of the stuff you mentioned there, like the whole warning of,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   okay, you should probably start dimming your lights right about now.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:14.040]   I think that's a good idea for people that don't quite understand, you know, circadian rhythms
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.680]   and getting your body tuned up for proper rest, right?
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.520]   That is true.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.200]   I'd be like, Stacy, I'd be arguing with it.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.200]   No, I'm not ready to own any me.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.280]   And that's what you say.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.040]   You sound the way you sound every day.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.240]   It's up to you.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.040]   If you want, I mean, is it helpful?
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.520]   Oh, the other thing I will say, because I did voice matching,
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.760]   if I, and I don't know what it'll tell me, how did I sleep last night?
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.960]   It looks like you don't have any sleep down or reported for that day.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.520]   Okay. But if you had asked that and you were here, Jeff, it wouldn't actually tell you,
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.800]   because it's tuned to my voice.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.640]   So it ties like the sleep data to my voice, which is nice.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   So I guess if my husband wanted to know how I slept, he couldn't.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.040]   Right.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.920]   So that was nice.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.400]   I don't know what else to tell you.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.480]   What are the three dots on the top, Stacy?
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.280]   Microphone?
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.800]   Can I, I don't know what y'all can see.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.320]   This is the solely thing right here.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.840]   The center thing.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.160]   Okay.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:29.880]   The center thing.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.720]   And then those are microphones, I believe.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:31.800]   Okay.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   Okay.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.960]   Did you ever have the pixel four or the four XL?
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.080]   Or was it only the four XL that had the solely radar?
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.160]   I can't remember if they both did.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.000]   Okay.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.640]   Here's a picture.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.680]   And this is what it looks like.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.920]   See that little thing up there in this corner?
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.960]   If you have sleep sensing on, that's how you know.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.080]   And it's always on there.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.400]   So you know that it's going to try to watch you sleep.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.160]   Oh, I got it.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.120]   So that's a little...
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   What a cute doggy.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.160]   Who's a good puppy?
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:01.640]   I know.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.280]   You're a good dog.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.240]   Cute puppies.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:09.000]   Do you, does the solely radar make more sense for a device like this
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.680]   than it did on a mobile phone?
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.560]   Yes.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.600]   Oh, and you can start.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.480]   Like this is actually kind of neat in my office setting or in the kitchen.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.280]   Like I don't actually have to touch the screen if it's playing stuff.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.880]   I can swipe to the next song or pause the music.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.920]   I think this is pause.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.640]   I haven't actually asked.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.040]   How reliable is that for you, actually?
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:35.400]   Um, I got up to four feet away and it was reliable.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.440]   Wow.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.800]   So...
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.360]   Because I can't say that about the 4XL phone,
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.680]   just swiping through Spotify or what have you.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.240]   Oh, God.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.160]   It is the worst experience.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.120]   And I might just pick up the phone and she's fantastic.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.640]   I'd be surprised if anyone that has that phone actually like
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.240]   is still like trying to make that stuff work because it never works.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.720]   You know what y'all?
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.040]   It's probably about three feet away now that I'm thinking about.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.160]   That's impressive.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:48:59.800]   Still.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.840]   That's impressive.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.200]   I mean, it's probably a larger sensor.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:02.280]   It's probably a larger sensor.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:02.600]   It offers.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.880]   It is.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.840]   It's a larger sensor.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.000]   It's nice if you're like playing in like if you're in the kitchen or your hands are dirty.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.400]   Like I do it because I'm lazy and it's far away on my desk,
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.800]   but everything has to be cleared in front of it.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:18.120]   So it's not like, like if there's something on it, obviously won't see it.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.640]   I'm literally having my morning routine of washing my face,
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.840]   brushing my teeth or whatever.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.840]   And I have music going and every now and then I want to hear something with a little more
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.240]   "Oomph."
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:31.960]   So I swipe in the air like a Jedi to tell Spotify to go to a different track.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.480]   Never happened.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.600]   The phone is right there on the sink with me, you know.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.800]   It's right there.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.760]   Never have.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.680]   Is this how much?
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.200]   I can't remember how much this is.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.040]   I think it's $99.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.000]   I think so too.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.120]   I just wanted to just, yeah, $99.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.320]   You could put this in your bathroom.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.120]   There's no camera.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.640]   There are my girls.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.080]   There is a physical switch for the off button for the mic.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.840]   So if you wanted to stick that in your bathroom and use solely,
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.800]   you could like, it wouldn't have the sounds of you peeing, I guess,
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.760]   if you're worried about that.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.800]   And then I don't think it would work.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.960]   But while you're in the shower, you could change tracks.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.000]   Well, me, I'm like, I don't know how far away your shower is
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.240]   and the moisture rating on this thing, but.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.520]   Yeah, I was going to say, I wonder how well it would stand up to.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.400]   The humid bathroom.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:21.800]   Oops.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.480]   Yeah, there is that aspect.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.200]   But sweet.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.520]   I mean, a hundred bucks is not that expensive.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.320]   I'm just, I know that the marquee feature of this,
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.800]   or at least the feature that Google is really touting,
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.160]   is the sleep tracking.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.400]   And I'm just in that camp where I'm like, how,
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.560]   like, how important is like knowing sleep data about myself to me?
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.440]   It's not at all.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.520]   But I realize other people have different needs.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.600]   I just don't know what I would do with that information.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   Like, I know when I wake up in the morning,
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.880]   whether I had a good sleep or not.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.520]   So I'll tell you, like, you'll stop drinking alcohol,
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.400]   because good golly gosh, I sleep.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.560]   I mean, after five days of no alcohol,
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.440]   I can totally see it in my sleep, like, pattern.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.400]   And it's, I mean, it's really distressing, I'll be honest.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.840]   I'll be like, oh, yeah.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.880]   Do I want to sleep?
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.680]   Do I want to have some restorative deep sleep tonight?
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.760]   Or do I want to have a glass of wine?
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.720]   Right.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.600]   These are terrible decisions.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.080]   I was going to say that.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:22.040]   I was going to say something similar along those lines, Mr. Howell.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.800]   That information is important if you're someone like me that knows they have
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.920]   bad sleep and habits to be able to get some type of analysis on what happened
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.800]   the previous day and previous night sleep,
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.440]   to try to combat that and lead up to a better night's sleep.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:43.560]   The days that I really, really push myself physically,
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.320]   you know, doing calisthenics or whatever,
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:53.080]   I'm assuming I'm going to just crash and just sleep like the best ever.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   And most of the time, it's not that.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   It's usually the inverse of that.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.520]   I'm waking up more often and stuff like that.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.360]   So I have to try to curtail how much I pushed myself during the day,
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.120]   because I still want to sleep,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.200]   but yet be able to recover properly to be able to perform the next day.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.600]   So yeah, that data is pretty important.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:18.520]   I wonder since we have the pixel for it, so would we be able to get something like this
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.160]   in that phone?
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.120]   Because you have phone stands out there that you can put on your nightstand
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.880]   and it has the sensor right there.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.800]   I wonder if we could do that in the future.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.320]   I mean, since they didn't put in the five,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.640]   I don't think Google's investing on the solely on the phone.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:29.960]   No.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.720]   And all of the phone.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.520]   This is important.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   All of the data, all your sleep radar data is processed locally
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.480]   on the device and only the insights are sent to the cloud.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.080]   So that's really important and I mean, your phone processor could do it.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:54.680]   I mean, I'm guessing the sensor that provides the solely radar capabilities
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.960]   is pretty small on the phone because it needed to be.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:02.760]   And I'm guessing it's not as small on the Nest hub
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.040]   because that's a larger form factor device.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.160]   It gives more distance.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.400]   That's probably why on the phone you have to be really close to it for it to register anything
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.560]   versus the Nest hub.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.400]   If you can close enough to just take it to any of those interactions on the phone
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.080]   from three feet away, I don't think it's going to do nothing when you try that.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:27.960]   Oh, I did want to say there's one other thing about this that gives me pause.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.640]   And I don't like the way that Google did this.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.600]   I see why they did it.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.840]   They talked about this in the launch for this.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.760]   They said, hey, for now the sleep sensing is a free feature.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:45.640]   And when I was doing the calibration, there's a tiny little message on the screen that sounds
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:51.240]   something about the Nest aware subscription, like warning me that it might become part of that.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:58.200]   And I was like, but it's possible that after Google figures out what it's going to do with Fitbit,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.560]   it will turn the sleep tracking into a paid feature, which means,
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.640]   like, I hope they don't do it this way.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.320]   I mean, at least they're trying to tell you.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.440]   But if the sleep sensing is really important to you on this device,
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:15.880]   know that you may end up having to pay more for it after like in like a year.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.800]   Which is a little sucky.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   And to not know the details of that now is kind of, especially if you're buying the device for that.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:30.680]   That's I feel like Google should probably the best way to implement that would be like,
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.000]   going forward for buyers of this device, it's going to cost X.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.800]   But if you already have it, you got a year free.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.160]   Right.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.160]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.280]   Or free forever, you know.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:50.200]   Like I realized maybe maybe it's, maybe it's me not understanding what it takes to run a business.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.840]   But I kind of feel like, you know, this is Google we're talking about.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:59.320]   They were they were floating free storage on photos for years with how many
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:05.400]   trillion fiber networks around the country at cost like this is a data.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:11.720]   The comparison is way different like just why pay for sleep data?
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.440]   Like, I don't know.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.680]   It's for free.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.240]   If you think, Jeff, like let's talk about what Sundar wants and thinks the future of it.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.800]   It's not slabs of glass and advertising.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.840]   It is services.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:24.840]   That's right.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.120]   Wearables having that to Am just.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.880]   When that out there.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:35.880]   And and and and recent, I think recently said that, you know, you were talking about what the decades
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.360]   of the net before and that we're passing out of the advertising supported net into the,
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.960]   from his view, because.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:47.000]   And recent horror was thinks it's a media company into paying creators directly net.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:52.200]   But a different way you can look at it is you go from the ad supported net to the service net.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:58.680]   Now the problem is very few winners there, very few people aren't going to, you know,
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:02.600]   there's only so many places you're going to spend your money on stuff on services, on content,
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.160]   on anything.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.000]   And the marketing cost of it is extremely high.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.480]   So I don't know that that's any Valhalla you arrive at, but nonetheless, you're right, Stacey.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.080]   Services with value.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.920]   I think package services with value.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.240]   Then the brand matters.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   Then do you trust Google did all these services for you?
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.160]   Do you trust Amazon to do it for you?
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.120]   You trust Facebook?
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:22.600]   No, you don't.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.440]   And so on.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.640]   Well, cool.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:29.880]   Okay.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.200]   So it sounds like you're pretty positive on this device.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.600]   I mean, there's obviously a couple of asterisks involved the sleep, you know,
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.800]   that potentially having to pay for the sleep data somewhere down the line,
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.640]   something that someone's going to have to ask themselves.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.240]   But a hundred bucks for this device, even if it doesn't do the sleep data,
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.840]   if you take sleep data and sleep, sleep tracking out of the equation,
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.440]   is it a recommend?
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.480]   Is it worth a hundred bucks?
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:56.280]   If you don't have a.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.840]   Oh, now we hear you.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.840]   Oh, I was like, I don't know what happened.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.040]   Okay.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:07.080]   If you don't have a Nest, Google Nest display, I don't know what the heck
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.040]   to call these things right now.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.480]   Or you want one without a camera.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.600]   This is a great one.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.360]   If you already have one, unless you listen to a lot of music,
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:20.440]   I mean, it'd be worth upgrading if you really care about the quality of the sound.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.440]   It's not going to sound as good as like the Nest audio,
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.520]   but it sounds way better than the first small Nest display.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.120]   Then you'd upgrade.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.600]   But yeah, for 99 bucks, for 99 bucks, it's a great digital picture frame.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.480]   I mean, the sunrise alarm is nice.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.440]   I feel like it's okay.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.400]   I remember when the standalone Google home was 130 bucks.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.680]   And that was just a little, a little dome looking thing with no screen.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.040]   So, you know, the price on the price.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:51.240]   So I didn't put this in the rundown, but your old friends at Sonos,
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.360]   do you see this or building a speaker into hidden art with Ikea?
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.440]   Yes, the symphonic.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.000]   Oh, really?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.560]   Symphonic.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:57:59.560]   Right.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:04.120]   So you could imagine this Google stuff being embedded into all kinds of things.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.760]   You know, your light switches, you said earlier, and God knows what all.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.400]   I feel like light switches are a terrible medium for speakers, but.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:11.720]   Yes.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.800]   Tiny little speakers.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.960]   I mean, they exist.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.320]   But everywhere.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.960]   I've tried light bulbs that have speakers.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.200]   I mean, so you pop them in your ceiling and your light bulbs.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:22.520]   Really?
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:23.960]   You've tried everything.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.240]   Senglid makes a lot of really interesting light bulbs.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.280]   If you're in the smart light bulb market, and they're very inexpensive.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.160]   So anyway.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.400]   I remember hearing about the speaker light bulbs and wondering if it would
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.240]   actually work because of all the heat.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.880]   They're LEDs.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.680]   So they're done.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:49.640]   All the father of LEDs died last week in case we want to honor that.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.040]   Because.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.000]   He had a new chat.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:53.560]   I've not heard that.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.160]   I can't use it.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:55.640]   Is it?
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.080]   Is Samu Akasak?
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.440]   Yes.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:04.280]   Blue LED inventor who shared the Nobel Prize in physics died at 92.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.200]   Respiescely.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:06.840]   Oh.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.160]   Yes.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.880]   I had missed that too.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.920]   LEDs are all the rage.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.960]   So thank you for that.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.320]   Sorry.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.280]   That was really random.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.480]   But I was like blue LEDs.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:17.720]   No.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.080]   It used to be like difficult and expensive and rare.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.160]   And he helped change that.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:24.680]   No kidding.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.800]   Let's see here.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.120]   Cool.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.440]   Well, thank you for your thoughts on that.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.640]   I was very curious about that.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.040]   We do have a little bit more Google news.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.640]   Here.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.200]   Let's see here.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:36.600]   Oh.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.040]   I know.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.360]   Looks like it looks like all these.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.880]   All of these.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.680]   At least this week.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.480]   There's two people.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:48.360]   Two notable names of people leaving Google.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.600]   One of them an AI ethics researcher.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.880]   Sammy Benjio.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.560]   Bingio.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.240]   Sorry if I'm mispronouncing your last name.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.120]   I probably am.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.800]   One of those was wrong anyways.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.160]   Google research manager.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.400]   He oversaw the AI ethics group.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.680]   Quit on Tuesday.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.720]   Actually, Timnet Gebru and Margaret Mitchell
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.360]   both actually reported to Sammy.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.400]   He's been with the company since 2007.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.320]   And so he has baled as well as well.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.560]   This whole AI ethics thing is just the.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.520]   Oh, just the hits keep coming for Google as far as that's concerned.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.200]   This was poor thinking because it's not like.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.880]   It's not like AI experts or diamond doesn't, right?
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.400]   These people can go anywhere.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.080]   And so.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.320]   If they don't like what you're doing.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.600]   That would be something to ask for.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.320]   But it's not necessarily for IO.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.160]   Right.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.600]   Well, yeah.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.160]   And the thing is.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:47.640]   The thing is.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.760]   He's only going to ask the keeper.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.960]   Exactly.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.440]   Exactly.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.120]   He's only going to answer the ones that they feel
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.640]   are comfortable answering.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.120]   Something tells me they would not.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.640]   They would choose to not answer that.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.520]   Oh, come on.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.000]   Which I suppose doesn't mean don't ask.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:01.640]   But.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.520]   Some gut skies.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.040]   You can do it.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.480]   Not only that.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.440]   The boss, the head of Waymo, John Craftkick.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.520]   Or is it.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.320]   Craftkick.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.840]   Why can I not pronounce people's names?
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.520]   Anyways, analysis departure.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.440]   He's been with the company five and a half years.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:28.120]   He was essentially brought in in 2015 to help bring Waymo to more of a commercial
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.000]   viability state.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.480]   And I think Google and Waymo kind of expected self-driving vehicles
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.240]   and the Waymo division to be further along now than it is.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:46.360]   But this is just the way of Waymo, I suppose, right now.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.400]   So he's going to be replaced by co-CEOs.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:55.000]   Takedra, Moa Keena, and Dimitri Dolgov.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:55.800]   Are going to replace him.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.480]   So it takes two people to replace.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.400]   Craftkick.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:01:59.720]   So.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.400]   Is this.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.600]   We'll have the job of the Chicago Tribune.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.640]   They had to replace me with two people.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.720]   And it feels really good when that happens.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.560]   Yeah, I told you I was working too hard.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.200]   Oh, I was like, I think it's the worst.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.320]   You're like, oh man, I was so working way too hard.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:13.960]   I was such a shush.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.440]   Oh, right.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.800]   It's confirmation.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.480]   It's confirmation that you're leaving.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.000]   And that was probably a good move.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.680]   When I read through this though, the question that came up for me
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:32.200]   is are we as tech journalists and our consumers who are really pro tech
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.480]   and pro autonomous vehicles?
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:39.720]   Are we just too optimistic about the future of self-driving cars
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.360]   versus what can actually be delivered at this point?
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.880]   Do we feel like things would be more delivered than they are right now?
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.400]   Or do we feel like it's on track?
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.320]   It's a bit late.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.680]   I mean, I remember thinking my daughter wouldn't have to get a driver's license.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.040]   Yeah, I mean, putting a grant.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.480]   And she's--
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.200]   I thought 2020 was going to be the year for all of this stuff.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:58.680]   You know?
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:02:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:06.200]   I'd like to see this to continue to progress.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.920]   So I'm not totally pinpointed or anything, but we're still--
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.720]   It is progressing.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   But it's like when you move, right?
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.040]   The last 80% is--
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.120]   What is it?
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:20.760]   Come on, y'all.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.480]   Help me out here.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.760]   It's like you're like 90% packed and the last 10% takes the most amount of time
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.640]   or is this difficult.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.040]   Right.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:28.920]   I know.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.880]   All the little stuff that's not quite so easy to just--
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.000]   That's where we are.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.960]   We're like--
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.720]   We got the big stuff down and now we're like,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.600]   "Oh, krikey.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.560]   People let's get in the middle of the street where they're not supposed to.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.600]   What are we going to do about that?"
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.800]   That's a really good point.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.280]   Ah.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.400]   Good point.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:47.800]   All right.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.400]   So optimistic again.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.480]   That's self driving cars.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.360]   You're doing all right.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.280]   You're doing all right autonomous vehicles.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.840]   Let's see here.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.960]   My voice is going.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:58.600]   Sorry about that.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.200]   Did you guys hear about this Lyra codec?
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.160]   I thought this was neat.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.800]   Google had announced this a month ago, I think,
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.840]   in relation to Duo.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.600]   And essentially, it's an audio codec that Google has been developing
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   to specifically for low--
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.240]   like really slow connection.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.440]   So essentially, this would allow for high quality audio
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.480]   to be transmitted over even 2G connections.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.680]   Yeah, I think we talked about it at the time
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.080]   because it was meant for countries with less bandwidth.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.640]   They were bringing it to--
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.840]   Merging markets.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.160]   Right.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.200]   Emerging markets.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.400]   Places where they might only have 2G connectivity, right?
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.200]   Like it's not something that we see here in the US,
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.760]   but in other parts of the world, absolutely.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.240]   And it turns out Google has open sourced this.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.160]   I think they said they were going to do this initially.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.440]   They just hadn't done it yet.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.080]   Now they're opening sourced--
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.600]   open sourcing Lyra and making the code available on GitHub
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.000]   so that other developers creating their own products
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.960]   can bring in that technology and improve the audio quality
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.640]   and reduce the level of data that's required
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.920]   in order to transmit it.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.840]   So that's cool stuff.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.720]   I think that's the key, opening it up to the community
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.000]   and letting more hands and eyes get involved in this
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.320]   to really bring this to life and make it better.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.360]   Support on the other hand may be another story,
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.120]   but at least this is something that'll be out there
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.280]   in the wild for people to be able to take advantage of.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.920]   Yeah, we'll certainly see how it distributes
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.520]   and how it's used and what that leads to.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.360]   But I think that's good news.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:50.120]   Google has acquired a startup and this is what is it called?
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:50.920]   Dysonics.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.280]   So apparently this happened last December
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.880]   and we're only just finding out about it now.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.480]   Google's been kind of cagey as far as any of this.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.160]   They're not really commenting on it much,
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:06.280]   but Dysonics as the company prior to acquisition
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.600]   developed a motion tracker for headphones.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.800]   So this would have this acquisition,
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.200]   it would seem, would have to do with 3D audio,
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.520]   which, you know, when could they finally fix the damn pixel buds?
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.040]   This is like the worst news.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.120]   And if you ask me, why am I going to worry about 3D
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.040]   and spatial audio and stuff like that,
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.320]   if just regular function earbuds don't work?
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:31.560]   Right.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.120]   So that's, come on, Google.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.240]   Maybe they're going to come out in like a year or two
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.960]   with something that's actually good and work in revolutionary.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.560]   If it just works, eventually, it just works dot dot dot eventually.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:52.040]   Apple is doing this with their Apple AirPods Pro, I believe.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.960]   I was thinking of the magic headphones.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.880]   Or was it the larger ones?
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.920]   Well, I know the big over the year,
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.400]   five hundred something dollar ones have it.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.960]   I don't know about the the fancier pros.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:07.880]   AirPods.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.640]   I believe also, yeah, the AirPods Pro article I read.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.920]   Anyway, I said AirPods Pro.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.800]   So it, the 3D audio is there, spatial audio is there.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.640]   Galaxy Buds Pro also offer this.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.720]   The idea being if you're watching something that supports it,
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.800]   like, you know, when you go to move your head, the sound,
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.600]   like I don't know that I've ever really experienced this, to be honest,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.880]   but the sound will kind of follow your head movement
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.760]   while in some cases keeping the like dialogue at the point,
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.720]   the place in space where the person is that's talking,
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.680]   just as one example.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.600]   So probably the closest you move your head to,
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.880]   no sound followed you.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.760]   Right.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.120]   You move your head and it drops off and completely,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.960]   yeah, yeah, completely.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   The closest I've seen is like with the Oculus in,
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.440]   what's the, oh, yeah, the Vive.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.680]   They had ambisonic sound with their 360 video.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.200]   And yeah, that's true.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.560]   That's about as close as you're going to get.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:16.040]   And this is designed for things like AR, right, in VR.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.160]   This isn't, I mean, I think it could be cool if like you're
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.640]   imagining Alien remastered for that, where you're like,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.960]   you turn your head and suddenly everything's, you know, changes,
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.720]   but really I think it's for less like today's entertainment
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.960]   and more of the immersive entertainment of the future.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.360]   Right.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.040]   Make more sense anyway.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.200]   Where it might appear, you know,
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.720]   nine to five Google posits, you know,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.040]   possibly the Google Pixel Buds like we've been talking, but I don't know.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.720]   Like, I guess I don't think of that kind of media experience
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.960]   as a tiny little earbud that you put in your ear.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.800]   I think of that more as like the over the ear,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.200]   kind of a bigger presentation sort of approach.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.040]   So who knows what that is.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.600]   Let me ask you something as to how with,
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.720]   with having earbuds in your ear versus wearing cans,
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.840]   I'm assuming you just have a less immersive experience
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.480]   wearing earbuds because of a fit or something like that,
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.640]   because a lot of times the earbuds, if they're properly fit,
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   they block out a lot of ambient sound.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.080]   Is that something that you have fought against and just rather have cans?
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.120]   Honestly, I think it,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.800]   no, I was going to say I think it depends on the application,
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.920]   depends on what I'm doing.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.240]   If I'm out, if I'm out gardening,
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.960]   I'd much rather have the earbuds than that's perfectly fine.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.320]   I could put on noise cancellation.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.600]   It really doesn't matter.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.680]   But if I'm sitting down in front of a screen
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.040]   and I'm watching something,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.840]   I would much rather have the over ear experience and get,
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.400]   you know, because inevitably, at least the headphones
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.720]   that I'm going to use that are over ear
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.880]   are probably going to be better drivers, larger components.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.200]   Just going to sound a little better
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.640]   because it has the space to do that versus in earbuds.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.000]   But I mean, they're coming a long way.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.200]   Now we're getting some some of them.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:04.680]   Yeah, they're getting there.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.400]   Some of them are.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.840]   Absolutely.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.200]   We're getting great isolation.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.240]   I bought some with noise cancellation
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.520]   and all sorts of fancy things.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.480]   I just did a comparison a couple of weeks ago with the Galaxy B.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.400]   Oh, you had a Jabra Elite, right?
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.360]   And the Jabra 85, yeah, the Elite 85.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.240]   That's what I just got.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.400]   Those are my favorites.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:25.960]   I love those.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.400]   Yeah, I've been with the Jabras for a few years now,
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.440]   and I'm really, every year.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.640]   Every year the ratio is better.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.360]   And a greater than a 65T.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.280]   Not a good upgrade.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:34.840]   That's a good upgrade.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.800]   Hot.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.080]   Twit.tv/hot.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.480]   Thank you for the promo.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.920]   I think that was last week's episode or the weeks before.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.440]   I can't remember what it was before.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.640]   Last week's was CalDigit.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.680]   There we go.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.120]   But yeah, you know, they've come a long way.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.560]   They're doing active noise cancellation now.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.000]   I think with those, it's all about the fit.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.360]   You got to get the tips that fit your ear
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.920]   can out perfectly because if they're too big,
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.040]   they're going to push out.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.800]   If they're too small, they're going to fall out,
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.720]   and you're not going to get that nice bass response.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.840]   So you got to find the right fit.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.720]   And some people just do not care for that suction feeling
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.280]   I'm used to it at this point.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.960]   But if I'm going to sit down and watch a movie,
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.520]   I would much rather have over the year,
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.560]   or I'm going to listen to an album at my desk.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.040]   Absolutely.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.640]   So who knows?
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.600]   Maybe Google will come out with an over the ear solution,
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.440]   similar to what Apple has done recently.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   That could absolutely happen.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.400]   I could totally see that.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.360]   Oh boy, I'm realizing we should probably take a break.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.240]   Let's take a break.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.640]   Then we will.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.560]   We're probably going to branch out beyond the Google
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.640]   after we take this break.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.200]   And there's some news, some Facebook news,
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.360]   some other things dotted throughout.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.320]   I actually just saw in the chat that Twitter
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.480]   might be in talks to acquire clubhouse.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.680]   We could talk about those talks.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.800]   And those talks ended.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.080]   Those talks ended so they're not might.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.000]   They're now, oh, they happened to,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.440]   which I'm feeling.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.160]   Oh, it happened in whatever.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.520]   Yeah, I'm kind of like,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.600]   of course someone's going to be like,
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.200]   oh crap, everyone's on clubhouse.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:12.840]   Let me call them up.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.760]   Yeah, like I'll give you a crazy amount of money.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.600]   They're really qualifies as news.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.320]   All right, well then fine.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.280]   We won't talk about that.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.320]   We'll talk about something else.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.200]   I don't know.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.120]   We got a whole lot more in here
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.640]   and having a great time hanging out with
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.080]   you guys.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.800]   Jeff Jarvis, Stacy Higginbotham,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.520]   and Pruitt.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.800]   Thank you for welcoming me to the show today.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.520]   Always.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.840]   Let's see here.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.880]   We want to tell you about CashFly.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.040]   CashFly is the sponsor of this week's episode
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.920]   of This Week in Google.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.720]   CashFly is also the deliverer of so much of Twitch's media
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.760]   throughout the years.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.240]   CashFly is the CDN that has been innovating content delivery
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.400]   since 1999.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400]   And we here at Twitch,
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.560]   we know them well because we've been working
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.920]   with them and using them for over 10 years.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.320]   So you wouldn't be getting the media that you get from us
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.840]   if it wasn't for CashFly.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.640]   They are awesome.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.920]   CashFly now offers ultra low latency streaming.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.040]   And it's not the web RTC solution
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.440]   that's let you down in the past.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.840]   Stream delays are less than one second.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.320]   And that's just kind of the start.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.760]   There are plenty more perks there.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.560]   They have an HTML5 player that offers easy support
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.720]   anywhere with SDK available for even better mobile support,
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.760]   whether you need your player to run on websites or applications,
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.600]   mobile devices, or another platform.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.720]   CashFly has you covered.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.560]   CashFly is the fastest CDN for throughput globally.
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.280]   They have over 50 pops distributed all over the world.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.760]   They have a low latency network.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.320]   That means that your video streams are going to be streaming
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.400]   quickly anywhere you have viewers.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.560]   Regardless of what continent they're on,
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.400]   they're going to be served much closer to where they actually are.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.520]   That content isn't coming from halfway across the world, in other words.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.160]   Also super scalable.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.800]   CashFly's ultra low latency video platform
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.560]   can deliver video to more than a million users concurrently,
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.680]   as well as ingest thousands of synchronous streams.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.480]   And you get reliable ingest there as well.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.160]   Their platform is designed for transmuxing thousands of streams
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.560]   simultaneously with live failover.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.240]   They can ingest RTMP, RTMPS, SRT, and so much more to deliver
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.520]   ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams at the same time.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.960]   And you can get a solution that's really tailored exactly for you.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.280]   You get a custom built solution based on your unique needs.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.440]   And it's built on top of their reliable, robust global network
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.400]   with the ingest and delivery where you actually need it.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.760]   And best of all, they have 24/7, 365 day priority support.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.320]   So you know they're always going to be there for you when you need them.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.840]   CashFly's infrastructure is massive.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.360]   They can support more than one million concurrent streams today
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.520]   because of their reliable throughput and scalability.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.720]   They are up to five times faster than other CDNs.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.840]   It's the world's most reliable CDN backed by 100% SLA.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.480]   And CashFly is helping others in need as well.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.040]   They've partnered with World Central Kitchen.

[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.560]   which is awesome.

[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.680]   All right.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.120]   Breaking news.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.000]   Breaking news.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:33.800]   Okay, great.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.360]   Jump into the break.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.560]   There's a catch up shortage.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.600]   Oh.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.520]   Really?
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.000]   I just thought I'd throw that in.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:41.960]   We were so excited.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.320]   I know.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.920]   Catch up.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.640]   Back to normal.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.200]   It's okay.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.760]   Well, there might be more detail in there.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.120]   Like what is it?
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.360]   Is it just is Heinz only?
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.400]   Pandemic related.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.040]   I don't understand.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.760]   People are using a lot of catch up during the pandemic.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.400]   So now we don't have to do that.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.880]   Restaurants are facing a nationwide catch up shortage.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.440]   It's shortage.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.000]   This is bad.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.280]   This is a sauce shortage.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.400]   It's true.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.800]   I mean, I can only think of what we've done in this household
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.880]   to contribute to the catch up shortage.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.680]   And we definitely have used our fair share of catch up.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.880]   We've got two young daughters.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.760]   So as I was going to say, it's all because there's a bunch of children in homes nowadays.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.480]   That's that.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.680]   Yeah, totally right.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:27.880]   That's all it is.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.160]   It's all right.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.120]   That was that.
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.080]   And parents don't want to cook like actual food.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.000]   You're like chicken nuggets again.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.320]   Yes.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.840]   What exactly where I was about to go to Stacey?
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.880]   I was going to say, you know, after a year of being here with the kids
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.480]   and realizing like it used to be easy to like send them to school.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.880]   And you knew at least some of your meals were going to be like passed off onto somebody else.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:55.000]   Now it's like we've got to get really creative three meals a day every single day of the week,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.520]   every single week of the year.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.240]   At a certain point, it's like, I don't care, drench it and catch up, whatever.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.640]   Whatever.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   Whatever.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   As long as you just eat it.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.960]   Mac and cheese.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.040]   I think my daughter eats that like probably five times a week.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.560]   And I feel no guilt.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.800]   Mac and cheese and catch up.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.760]   Man, well, not together.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.440]   No, together.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.440]   I know Joe.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.040]   That's real talk.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.240]   I've heard that too.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:23.560]   Yes.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.040]   Yes.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:24.440]   Okay.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.800]   No, I'm not saying that for me.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.240]   I don't know that I've ever had catch up at my Mac and cheese.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.520]   And it sounds disgusting.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.280]   But I kid you not last night.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.440]   I was reading my daughter's story called, I think it's called Chrysanthemum.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.800]   And in it, the kid in the story talks about having her mac and cheese with catch up.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.760]   So it's a thing.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.280]   It's in kid stories.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.640]   Oh, no, we've just spread it.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.520]   Is this what you've done?
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.160]   Now you're a vector of disinformation out there in the world.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.040]   I'm amplifying catch up in mac and cheese.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:52.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.560]   See, this is how it happens.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.680]   Didn't need to do that.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.400]   So it happens.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.640]   Let's see here.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:06.360]   How about 500 more than 500 million users, phone numbers and data leaked?
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.480]   Can you explain this to me?
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.560]   That was a 2019 leak.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.680]   Why is it in the news now?
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.560]   I'm just not.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.440]   It was put up somewhere.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.120]   Yeah, David was actually put up for people to have access to.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.280]   Beforehand, it was it was leaked, but no one shared it.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.640]   So who who put it up?
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.600]   Who had it to put it up?
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.680]   I didn't follow the story.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:33.240]   I don't know that we know or I don't know that I've seen any ways who put it up necessarily.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:40.200]   Yet, however, it is now appearing on the dark web for free.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:47.400]   So it's not even this large mass amount of information that is being sold on the dark web.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.440]   It's just there and anyone has access to it.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.320]   And it has a lot of phone number information.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.480]   Oh my god, they're going to ruin the phone.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.400]   Geez, I might be getting junk calls.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.760]   Oh my god.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.200]   The phone is useless.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.640]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:08.520]   I get far more spam calls on my phone number than I actually would call.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.480]   That's why the Google screening is so great.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.320]   Google's like, hey, do you want me to screen this?
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.360]   And I'm like, oh yeah, I do.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.040]   Yeah, why is my phone not doing that lately though?
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.080]   That's that's a good point.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, how do you turn that on?
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.040]   Where do you turn that on?
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:25.640]   Every time I have to take Google, I lose features and gain features.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.960]   And there's no rhyme or reason to it.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.240]   It drives me bonkers.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.800]   Where did I turn that on?
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.400]   I think it offered it to me one day.
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.360]   Do I have what bugs me is every time I open the dialer,
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.720]   it has that whole, do you want to place them on hold,
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.960]   why they have your own hold, whatever the little,
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.200]   I think they have the chairman.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.240]   There it is.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:47.640]   Call screen.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.760]   Yours is verified.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.440]   Where did you get to it?
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.480]   How did you get to it?
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.960]   It's well, so if you go into your phone app,
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.440]   I'm not going to go out there because it's got a bunch of other stuff.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.520]   So they're going to go into settings,
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:03.400]   then you've got down here at the bottom spam and call screen as a feature.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.480]   And so that's where you go.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.000]   And you can activate that in there.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.440]   But apparently I had it activated.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:12.920]   So I don't know why I'm seeing spam calls.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.080]   Do you want me to call you an offer you insurance?
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:20.040]   Less spam calls?
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.560]   I'm seeing a lot of spam text messages, like tons of them.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.480]   Suddenly.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.080]   So I don't know. I think it should any way they can.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.520]   Yeah, so there was that with Facebook.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.400]   I mean, it's just a lot of people's information.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.120]   But you're right.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.600]   I mean, at this point, at this point,
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.040]   I feel like I see this story a million times every single month.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.840]   At a certain point, I just kind of get desensitized to it.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.960]   It's like, OK, well, it's data.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.000]   It's already out there.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.080]   When I go to haveibimpone.com,
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.800]   there's like 10 different things that I've been pwned.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.080]   But it goes back to like 2007 for me.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:21:59.800]   It lists the mall.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.200]   So you're like, oh, my God, I went and did it again.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.320]   And it's all again.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.480]   Yeah, I did not find my information in the in the in the.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.520]   They have updated haveibimpone.com, by the way,
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.240]   with the information from the Facebook dump.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.640]   And I did not find my information in there, at least.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.680]   You can put in your phone number.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.240]   No, I didn't either.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.680]   Part of that.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.240]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:22.280]   But I mean, there is a security element to that too.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.040]   I would imagine like for like two-factor authentication
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:31.160]   that uses a phone, that could be a vector for someone
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.080]   who really wants to take advantage of some of the phone
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.120]   numbers they find in there.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.360]   It couldn't just it could also not just be locked into like spam calls.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.200]   It could be people who kind of use it on a deeper level, you know,
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.040]   to do two factor.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.680]   But how likely is that to happen to everybody?
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.120]   I don't know.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.080]   Things to fear, I guess.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.320]   How about-
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.480]   The other story I didn't want to I didn't want to delve into
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.800]   eubenic green, what I'm just going to ask here,
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.480]   is the Amazon urination story.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.160]   Okay, we don't need to.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.840]   Well, no, I have a question.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.480]   I have a question.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.920]   I presume that.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.600]   I mean, it has to be talked about.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.360]   No, but I presume that in a time of COVID in every restaurant
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.360]   and every store and everybody closes all the restrooms.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:21.160]   I just presumed the part of the problem was if you're driving all day for Amazon,
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:27.640]   how do you and is that a factor in this story or do we not hear?
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.320]   Well, I mean, the issue was-
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.840]   In line.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.400]   That was an issue.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.840]   Well, I'm just thinking about the fact that drivers have to pee in bottles.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:42.040]   Part of it was their quotas didn't allow for time for biological functions, right?
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.600]   You just had to make these package deliveries.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:49.000]   And then the secondary issue was where can they go to do it?
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:49.640]   Right.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:54.200]   And this is something the UPS people, I mean, this is not just Amazon.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.720]   Yeah, it's everybody right now.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.680]   It's going to be tough out there.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.920]   Well, even before, I mean, it's not like if your UPS guy was like,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.960]   "Hey, can I use your bathroom?"
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.480]   You'd be like, "No, dude."
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.200]   Hey, hey, quite frankly, if you're just in average and prove it,
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.160]   sometimes they're not going to let you use the bathroom either,
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.760]   because people are closing down their bathrooms because there's so much
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.440]   idiocy happening inside of bathrooms, destroying them and whatnot.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.640]   So yeah, this isn't really an Amazon problem.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.720]   This is just, it is what it is today.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.880]   The UPS guy goes to a bookstore and says,
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.920]   "Can I use your bathroom in the old days?"
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.360]   "What is it, sure, dude?"
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.480]   But now, no, it's closed everybody, including staff, I think.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.360]   Yeah, there's a definite, like,
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.440]   we're going to talk about infrastructure week.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.280]   There is a definite public restroom infrastructure shortage here in the US.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.040]   I mean, like, you're up there's paid for it.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:42.600]   Pisswars.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:43.640]   Chip.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.680]   Pay out.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.800]   We need pisswars.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.280]   Nope.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.480]   I know it's an off-board.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.440]   I'm not saying the word.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.920]   You're almost made it here.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.120]   Stacey is French.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:54.760]   It's okay.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.880]   It's not.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.000]   I'm not doing it.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.040]   Anyway, we really do need-
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.400]   This is going to be a challenge.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.120]   Now, we're going to have to find the time we can get Stacey to say Pisswars.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.080]   We're going to find a way.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.120]   We're going to find a reason.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:08.760]   It's going to happen.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:14.840]   Anyway, we really do need public bathrooms.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.480]   Yes, we do.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.480]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.880]   I had not considered that aspect.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.280]   I had not thought about this story through that lens.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.800]   That is a really important point.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:26.280]   Even think as a parent.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:26.920]   Where do you go?
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.040]   Remember-
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.600]   I mean, I did like-
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:36.440]   I bullied somebody here very recently letting my daughter in to use the bathroom,
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:41.080]   even though she's 14 and really should know how to go to the bathroom before we leave the house,
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:41.800]   but that's okay.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.200]   I'm not going to ask you anymore.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.240]   You're 14.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.440]   I used to ask you-
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.960]   You got mad at me when I asked you,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.920]   so I'm not going to ask you anymore.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.880]   It's your responsibility.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.440]   But yeah, you have young children.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.360]   I mean, where do you do with them?
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.720]   Carry around.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.880]   So Amazon screws up so much, right?
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.000]   They screwed up.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.880]   They lied about it.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:04.600]   That was stupid.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.240]   They could have said,
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.000]   "Hey, the conversation we just had."
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.120]   But they could-
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.240]   Then there's-
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.800]   I read a story about the union-
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.760]   and the union-
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.520]   fine unionized.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.640]   Just let it happen.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:16.680]   It's going to happen anyway.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.120]   But that process is going to drag on forever now.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.040]   Yeah, probably so.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:31.080]   I mean, there's just a wide kind of unionization thing happening with big tech right now.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.280]   So I know Leo has mentioned in recent weeks,
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.600]   like these stories are less technology and more labor,
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.440]   labor, social laws, and stuff.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.560]   And so maybe less appropriate or less necessary to be discussed on the shows.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.600]   I did not-
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.520]   I will say though that I did not care for Amazon's response,
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.640]   that tweeted response.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.640]   Yeah, I really put a sour taste in my mouth.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.080]   And I was just like, "Oh, come on."
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.120]   Like what?
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.120]   I can understand not agreeing,
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.800]   but it was such a pissy tone.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.080]   It was like, "You don't need to do that."
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.480]   Oh, did you have to say that that way, Jason?
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.840]   I'm like, "Yeah, I'm like, wow."
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.280]   You really say that, Jason?
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.480]   I'm afraid it's such a pissy tone.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.080]   That's better.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.920]   Is that a word we can't say on this show?
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.560]   It probably is.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.920]   I think we're headed toward pissy-wars.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.040]   Oh man, it's the mail can.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:22.840]   I leave that.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.040]   That's an ownership title.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.240]   Yeah, that's a better show.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.200]   Would you have preferred a standard PR playbook tweet response?
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:36.280]   I appreciate the fact that this was almost human what they tweeted back.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.680]   Instead of the, "Yeah, we're taking actions to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.040]   that every big tech company says straight out of the PR playbook page 25."
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.320]   But they lied.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.640]   Yeah, that's the problem they lied.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.640]   They just had to lie.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.240]   I was like, so instead of taking a page from the PR
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.440]   trade playbook, they're taking one from like what the Trump administration playbook
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.160]   where you're just like, "This is an alternative fact."
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.480]   No, they lied.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.240]   There's nothing to see you for long.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.760]   Dude, y'all, I am so blurry.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.200]   What is happening to my camera?
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.520]   I've got the Barbara Walters event.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.200]   No, I don't know.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.560]   Vanuist?
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.880]   No, I plugged in.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.440]   Okay, sorry.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:19.400]   I'm like, "Crisp."
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.560]   Well, you know.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.760]   I don't mind being like, "Fill me in soft."
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.400]   Streisand.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.840]   You can start singing like Streisand.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.480]   Exactly.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.520]   I cannot.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.000]   Todef.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.440]   What about the ACLU story?
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.200]   That got a little bit of attention.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.400]   ACLU was coming under fire.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.400]   It was revealed last week that it was sharing data with Facebook,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.320]   which I mean, who isn't.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:57.720]   But when it comes down to it, it's ACLU and they're an organization that kind of makes a statement against
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.240]   I'm getting the paywall.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.520]   What were they sharing and why?
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.040]   They're usually four to people, right?
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.040]   Yeah, four to people.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:04.920]   They were sharing.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.880]   First of all, the context.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:10.680]   So this is information that was collected when people were visiting the site,
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:16.120]   when they were signing up with mailing lists, buying something through the ACLU site,
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:20.360]   making donations, data shared with Facebook, including names, addresses, phone numbers.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   I mean, why?
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.160]   Yeah, well, that's a great question.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.440]   Was it just negligence or was it a business reason for them?
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.080]   I believe that I'm trying to remember exactly what it was because they talked about it.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:33.640]   Privacy policy.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:39.880]   And then when they updated their privacy policy, they disclose that it shares data with Facebook.
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:45.800]   From their website visitors, if you join a distribution list, make a purchase or submit a
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.360]   donation.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.400]   It includes your name, email, address, phone number, and zip codes.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.560]   So basically, why were they doing that?
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.160]   That's what I was told to write and understand.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.240]   Oh, I imagine it's so they could solicit more donations from like-minded people also
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:29:59.800]   in Facebook.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.160]   Oh, yeah, you know what?
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.280]   They probably could build a like this set for everything.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.000]   Yeah, that would be my-
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.400]   That's probably what it was then.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:07.960]   Okay.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.120]   There's probably a legitimate business reason, but it's-
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.640]   Oh, data on Facebook.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.440]   You don't have to want to go near that third rail now.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.080]   Technopan.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:21.400]   Well, I mean, yes, data in Facebook, but then also kind of like, I think what captured
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.120]   certain attention about this is that it's ACLU.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.720]   And this would be the kind of thing that they would-
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.200]   Right.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:30.040]   In other cases, kind of turning the table and looking outward,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.080]   going, "Hey, you shouldn't do that."
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.040]   Oh, let me look it up.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:32.840]   Right.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.120]   Their statement just said-
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.160]   What is that book you're reading?
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.200]   Is that moral-
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.960]   Phoenix?
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.680]   Oh, I'm not-
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.000]   Okay.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.960]   All right.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:42.360]   All right.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:45.080]   Fair enough.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.680]   Fair enough.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.440]   Yeah, and they see you'll-
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.720]   They- they punted on this.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.840]   Their- their statement was-
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.640]   They must often-
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.720]   The ACLU must often work with companies that we are actively challenging to improve
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.720]   their own policies and practices.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.240]   So basically-
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:30:59.880]   Okay.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.240]   Yeah, we're using it too.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:01.800]   We got to.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.320]   Um, trying to see what else.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.720]   Is there anything in here that y'all, um, want to see-
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:11.880]   You can see-
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.360]   Are we talking-
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.000]   A young British person discovered the taste of ranch dressing.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.760]   Oh no.
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:19.480]   Online 72, speaking of sauces.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.680]   Let's go to say we got a catch-up in here.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.840]   We've got ranch dressing.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.920]   How did we do this?
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.760]   Just-
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.720]   Jeff is like, can I come by TikTok?
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:31.960]   We have-
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:32.360]   I'd be in-
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:32.360]   Tik-
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:32.880]   Pix-
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.320]   Yes.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:33.560]   Yes.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.320]   Try to find something on TikTok that'll drive in-
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.680]   Crazy or somebody crazy.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.320]   You don't have to do that.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.080]   Mission accomplished, sir.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:41.880]   You don't have to do that.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:49.320]   Um, Mike Masnick blows a proper gasket over the New York Times in section 230.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:51.800]   So-
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.160]   Tell us a little bit about this-
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:53.880]   This Clarence-
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.000]   I mean, I'm assuming this is-
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.280]   Is this in-
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.480]   No, there was the Clarence Thomas-
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:58.200]   Thomas is separate.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.240]   There was the Clarence Thomas-
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.360]   Oh, 30.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.080]   Where he screwed it up and he got it all wrong.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.920]   But that's just Clarence Thomas.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:05.800]   And then Masnick-
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.560]   The New York Times has been messing up on 230 again and again and again and again,
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.320]   and Masnick, God bless him,
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.600]   just blew a gasket about it.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.560]   And he put it every link-
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.240]   Every time they've screwed up 230,
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.320]   it's one more column is getting it wrong.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.520]   And at this point, I think it's-
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.400]   I think it's purposeful.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:19.880]   I think they're-
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.440]   They're-
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:23.000]   They've got a campaign against 230 in the internet.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.120]   And it's driving me nuts.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.800]   So I also just wanted to give Mike a plug,
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.920]   because I love what he does that.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.640]   So he's doing this and trying to raise awareness and-
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.360]   But does New York Times know,
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.360]   because they are repeat offenders of this?
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.720]   Have they been contacted and reached out to him and say,
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.400]   "Hey, thanks for letting us know."
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.960]   No, I mean, everybody's complained on Twitter again and again,
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.480]   and again, all the top experts have complained
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.760]   about the New York Times,
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.040]   and they just ignore it.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.960]   Isn't it that they're mostly their opinion writers?
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.640]   It's not their actual journalists, right?
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.280]   It is basically-
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.560]   No, they did a huge-
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.160]   Well, yes, primarily you're right,
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.120]   but there have been cases.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.400]   They did a huge package.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.760]   They defined 230 wrong.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.280]   They had to correct it like in hours,
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.200]   and it took them away the whole package.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.800]   They have messed up again and again,
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.000]   it drives the law people I know just completely berserk.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.400]   That is so weird.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.920]   Well, this is where I'm going to go to-
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:16.760]   Back to them.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.640]   I think that they're-
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.520]   I think it's becoming purposeful.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.560]   I think that they're they're a having clicks this way, right?
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:28.920]   Is it part of it also they're they're trying to disadvantage their internet competitors.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:34.520]   Uh that feels pretty. Like it's very oriented.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:41.560]   Uh really I mean that's you're basically accusing a newspaper of lying to people
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.400]   like destroying its journalism to further its own wealth model.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.040]   Is that really what I want?
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.280]   Why also they got in the wrong this many times.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.680]   Completely, absolutely utterly, simply wrong.
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.560]   People are kind of not smart sometimes.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.040]   It's the New York effing times.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.800]   The New York effing times like let me tell you how many times I read stuff in the New York
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:04.520]   effing times and I'm like are you really a tech reporter? That is not how physics.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.560]   Yeah I know. Yeah.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:12.520]   So again, this is when you ask where the editors and who's above the editors
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.760]   that are allowing this to continue to go out.
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.040]   Right.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.480]   Right.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.920]   And indeed.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:21.960]   Oh, well, all right.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.480]   Thank you for that.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.480]   And shout out to Mr. Masnick.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.400]   Yeah, he's awesome.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.160]   He is he is the best.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.920]   He's super busy. I've tried.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.280]   I've asked him to come on to twig or twit.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.920]   He's just been so busy lately and he has been.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.480]   I mean, he's he's he's defending the entire internet.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:42.120]   Yeah, he's holding it all up on his own.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.320]   So you've got to give him the space to give Jeff Kossaf or it.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.520]   There are only defense.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:51.320]   Why don't we, uh, why don't we sound the horns?
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.600]   Let's do the change log.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.640]   I think we're there.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.120]   Let's do it.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:58.120]   Oh, you got Google change log.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:03.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.640]   What are you play Jason?
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.520]   Do you don't sound?
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.600]   Don't you play a brass instrument yourself?
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.200]   Oh boy.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.360]   When I was younger, I played the trombone.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:12.840]   I don't.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.840]   I think you want to have a spare trombone there.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.120]   Just that the ready is a backup.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.800]   Oh, that would be so great.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.520]   That would be so great.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.640]   I don't know where I'd fit it.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:24.360]   I'm literally squashed in the corner of my bedroom.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:27.640]   You'd smash the camera out of the way.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.200]   We need that wide shot of Mr. House.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.640]   I'll sit right now.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.760]   It's beautiful.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.800]   It's a corner.
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.080]   It's literally a corner.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.520]   I have to crawl under the desk every time I'm going.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.120]   I've seen you climb into that set a couple of times in the past.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.080]   It's hilarious.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.280]   Hey, we make do with what we have.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.040]   This is the best solution that I can come up with
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.080]   when the pandemic happens.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.120]   So you are not putting your studio in the living room.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.880]   I don't care if this is how we make a living room.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.760]   No, you are not putting all this crap in the living room.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.440]   Well, it doesn't even matter.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.480]   We have a den.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.160]   We actually have a den downstairs.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.960]   The problem is the den has no door to close it off from the kitchen and from the living room.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.280]   So I have a space.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.560]   It's just the kids are going to be doing their school.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.040]   You know, my wife works out of the house as well.
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.960]   This was the only way that I could like close the door
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.000]   and know that I wasn't going to disrupt everything and vice versa.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.440]   So anyway, it's working.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:22.920]   It's working out.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.640]   Take my space.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.160]   It has worked out.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:25.560]   All right.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.000]   So what's going on here?
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.440]   Well, let's see here.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:34.120]   We've got the Pixel 5 getting an update at the April 2021 update,
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:40.280]   which I'm hearing at least on on Twitter, a lot of people saying they're seeing some improvements.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.840]   There's a there's a GPU performance gain.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.160]   As part of this update.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:50.200]   So if you've got a Pixel 5, definitely want the April 2021 update,
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.560]   you might actually see some speed improvements on certain aspects.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.680]   Well, it becomes less me.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:57.240]   More.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.760]   I'm probably a little bit of a bit of a battery, but too, right?
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.000]   Probably so.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.120]   Absolutely.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.280]   And actually there's a few other improvements here, camera quality,
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.120]   and how that translates into third party apps.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:18.040]   Game performance sounds like a pretty pretty decent upgrade for the Pixel 5.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.160]   So make sure that when you see that April update, if you have it,
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.080]   make sure and let it go through.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.240]   And you'll be happy that you did.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:30.360]   Also Android 12 developer preview 2.2.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.880]   There's been a couple of updates actually of the developer preview.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:40.280]   The second one, they had one that went through like a like a it's like they did the developer preview
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.920]   2 and then they did an update like a week ago and now they have another one with more security
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.800]   patch of bug fixes.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.080]   So I don't know what's going on there.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:51.080]   Probably doesn't apply to most people watching and listening to this show because it's the developer
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:51.880]   preview.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.440]   I don't know.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.640]   I pretty positive no one on this panel is updating to the dev preview at this point.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.560]   I'm not even doing it right now.
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.880]   So you're not you the God of Android.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:02.360]   Is it?
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.200]   I well, I have it on a microphone.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:11.160]   So often, I would actually just put it on my daily driver because I want to know.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.440]   But this time I chose to put it on a separate phone.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.280]   I'm going to wait until the actual beta.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.320]   If it's the device.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.480]   I was there the day that you watch your phone.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.640]   I was there for that famous day.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:25.400]   I got to be careful now.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.040]   Yes, you do.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:26.600]   Yes, you do.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.480]   Is Mr. Howl just getting older?
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.280]   Is he getting older and wiser with all of this?
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.080]   Definitely getting older.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.320]   It means to be seen of him getting wiser.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:43.560]   Google is doing support for the Rust programming language, which this was a store.
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.720]   One of those stories, I was like, okay, I'll take your word for it.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.160]   I don't necessarily understand it.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:52.280]   When I read into it further, it's essentially there are different ways to develop for Android.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.160]   If you want to develop for the OS itself and not necessarily apps, if you do an app,
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.520]   you might use something like Kotlin.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.000]   If you're developing for the OS itself, you might use C or C++.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.920]   Rust is another way to develop for the operating system itself.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:14.520]   And it actually addresses memory, safety better than C and C++ do.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.280]   So if you're a developer, that probably makes a heck of a lot more sense to you than it does to me.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.120]   Google's apparently been working on this integration for the last 18 months.
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.400]   So there you go.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.120]   They'll be talking about it in Virtual I/O.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:29.240]   Did you hear about Rust?
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:29.960]   Yes, maybe they will.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:30.840]   They sure will.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.960]   They sure will.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.440]   Rust.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.320]   Yes, right. A couple of years ago, we had the Kotlin announcement and everyone in the audience
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.680]   went nuts for it.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:41.160]   So I wonder if Rust can take the screen on the audience?
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.120]   That's because it's new, but Rust is not a new programming language.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:44.920]   Kotlin was new.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.320]   People were very excited about Kotlin.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:55.720]   It's like a, I feel like Rust is, I feel like it's been around for like a decade, y'all.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.520]   It's been a while.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.160]   Well, late to the party, but at least came to the party.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:11.720]   Google Play Music has one final update that lets you hide the app on your phone.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:15.480]   And I'm guessing, I didn't get to read through this, but I'm guessing some phones might have
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:19.400]   Google Play Music kind of installed and it's still there, even though if you launch it,
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.400]   like you can't get it to run anymore.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:27.000]   And this final update will, well, I call this episode, the update that kills the app.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:30.600]   It's like the reverse of recursion.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.640]   That's actually kind of nice that they're thinking about that.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.840]   For people like me who like want everything on their screen to be like,
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:43.320]   uniform, no, I just want it to be like, there's no room in my life for like non-essential stuff.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.200]   You just gotta get rid of it.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:45.880]   I'm with you.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.120]   Okay.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.480]   Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.040]   Definitely.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:53.880]   Why have the nap icon in your tray that literally does nothing when it's done,
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:54.360]   it's done.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.880]   Let me, let me remove it, please.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.280]   Absolutely agree.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.760]   We were talking about the Pixel Buds earlier and I think last week Leo may have mentioned in the
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.640]   change log that there was a possibility of a Pixel Buds A coming somewhere down the pipeline.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:19.720]   And apparently there was an email sent out, I don't know who it was sent out to exactly.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:22.200]   Oh, it was the Google Nest mailing list.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:28.440]   And anyways, in that email it shows the whole family of Google devices and under accessories,
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:34.760]   or above accessories, is a version of the Pixel Buds that have like a greenish,
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.440]   like a mint color to them.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.800]   And we haven't seen that yet.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.760]   That's a version of that.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.240]   That takes a version of that.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.960]   That really knows their Google stuff to notice that.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.080]   Because it's very agree.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.280]   Totally.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.560]   But it's definitely not wide either.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.800]   They like the buds themselves are green and the buds usually are one question.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.480]   What do they work?
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.440]   That's a good question.
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.920]   I can't answer them.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.760]   None of the time they work half the time.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.280]   So there is a little improvement.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.240]   Yeah, I turned my head.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.680]   You know what drove me nuts about it?
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.200]   I could never find a pattern.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.680]   Oh, it's when I turned my head this way.
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:11.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:11.880]   Do that.
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:12.920]   No, it's when I do that.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.960]   No, my hand is here.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.160]   No, my head is there.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   There was no pattern to it.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.840]   Oh, it's when I'm facing the east.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.200]   When I'm facing the west, no.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.640]   No way can I find out when the damn things wouldn't work.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.720]   They just often wouldn't work.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   He's doing the hokey pokey while he turned himself around.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:33.240]   And why didn't it happen only outside?
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.320]   It basically didn't have an inside.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.600]   It happened outside.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.080]   Why?
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:37.800]   Air?
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.840]   It made no sense.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.680]   Not walls.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.920]   No walls hurt the bounce off of.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.200]   I don't know.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.720]   I don't know.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.880]   They're not alone.
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.640]   They are very glitchy.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.000]   That is disappointing because I really like them
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.760]   for the totally hands-free assistant.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.880]   Going on runs or whatever.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:03.080]   When I don't want to have the interact with my phone or whatever,
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:03.880]   it was awesome.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.920]   I could just say, skip forward 30 seconds or skip forward two minutes.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.280]   That was awesome.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.000]   That's pretty cool.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.480]   But pretty glitchy.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.280]   So there's that too.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:17.800]   Google workspace users are going to get some extra time.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.960]   To create unlimited docs.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.400]   They're going to get until next year.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.560]   Apparently this was an extension that Google had initially set
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.040]   for docs, sheets, slides, other workspace files
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.360]   to not count against storage caps.
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.520]   I think because of the pandemic back in November,
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.320]   they announced this.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.840]   It was going to go through June 1st.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.800]   But now we're getting an extension to go into 2022.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:45.160]   So you get more free doc files that don't count against your storage space.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.640]   Are they free forever?
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.960]   Or come next year, they start charging you for all this stuff?
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.080]   That's a good question.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.000]   If you create a bunch of these docs and then, yeah, that's a good question.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:55.560]   I wonder.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.560]   Delay the count.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:07.320]   Man, I'm guessing that it's free forever.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:08.920]   But why would it be?
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:09.480]   It should be.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.160]   It should be.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:16.520]   But usually whatever you have in your drive counts against your storage quota.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:17.320]   All right.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.120]   So yeah, that's a good question.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.320]   I don't know the answer on that one.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.880]   Of course, Google's storage is very cheap.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.240]   Yes, it is.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.920]   I'm not going to complain.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.440]   I have other things to complain about.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.640]   That's not what I'm going to say.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:37.960]   Your earbuds and my status as a workspace is customer in other areas.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.920]   I'll complain about this.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.920]   Yes, that will never go away.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.680]   Two docs here or there.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:53.160]   Google is opening up Android Auto to, I think, third party navigation options,
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.080]   parking, charging apps.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.840]   Just more integration with apps.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:02.680]   In other words, Android Auto for quite a while has been in some ways kind of locked down to
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:08.600]   Google's own apps for certain things like navigation and ways, I think eventually.
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.200]   And now they're opening it up even further.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.920]   So that's good if you use Android Auto or really use Android Auto very much.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.600]   Maybe I should, but I don't.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.080]   I do.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:17.720]   It's only you.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.880]   I don't drive anymore.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.760]   So yeah, you're not going anywhere, Mr. Hal.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:23.560]   So what's that?
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:26.280]   That's true.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.000]   That's true.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.240]   Go in more places now.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:29.960]   It's opening up.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:30.920]   Maybe I should use it again.
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:33.800]   And then finally, and I think you.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.040]   So I put this one in there.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:37.960]   I'm very excited about one feature.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:38.600]   Very excited.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   So I've talked in the past.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.760]   This is a new Chrome OS update.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.640]   And a few things in it.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:50.040]   One is I've long since wanted multiple cut and paste.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:53.880]   Like what I'm doing the rundown, I got to cut and paste once for the URL,
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.760]   cut and paste once for the headline, cut and paste once, cut and paste once.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.920]   Now when you cut and paste into Chrome OS, it displays the last five things you've saved in a
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.160]   memory.
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.480]   So you can.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:05.960]   Okay.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.520]   And then I used to have a separate app for that.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.480]   Exactly.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:15.880]   I used to have it. We used to call saved get keys in my prehistoric days of of newsroom systems.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.080]   So now you can put the URL in and then you put the headline in and it's going to it's going to
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.920]   save Jason Howell immense amounts work.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920]   I'm very happy with that.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.640]   That's a good one.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.280]   The other one that's good is they've improved the screen grab piece.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.280]   So now when you mark something, it's something that says you want to save this and you can
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.320]   change the shape of it.
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.320]   You can do all kinds of things to it and do other stuff too.
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.920]   So that's good.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:40.520]   Um,
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:49.080]   it, uh, it says directly controls your Android phone, but we'll let me do that because apparently
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.800]   I make Google workspaces person.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:56.200]   Wi-Fi works better.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.640]   Powerful screen capture tools.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.360]   We did that already.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:01.080]   Then keep critical files at your fingertips.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:07.560]   Now on the bottom of the screen, it'll give you three little, um, icons for the last three files
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.600]   you did something to write there.
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:16.920]   Now, um, uh, Stacy's, uh, air, swell partner in all things, other things, podcast, did a whole
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.440]   piece about how to get rid of that.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:23.160]   But evidently you can only get rid of it.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.440]   Kevin said for a while because then it's going to come in and be there permanently and it's
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.320]   irritating people because it changes their, their tray.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.000]   But you can keep critical files at your fingertips.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.040]   Um,
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.880]   more about a, uh, assistant who cares.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:42.920]   Uh, the desks, uh, supposedly that's easier.
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:43.960]   I don't really use the desks.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:47.240]   Uh, personalized your lock screen who cares.
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.840]   Easy access to your media controls.
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:49.800]   I don't care.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:50.200]   That's it.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:51.800]   But there's a lot of changes in Chrome OS.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.360]   That was a lot.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.560]   Hmm.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.640]   That is a Chrome substantial update.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:58.760]   It's for the time to sound like a productivity OS.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:47:59.720]   Yes.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.680]   Yes.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.600]   It's, I'm telling you, I'm telling you folks.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:03.560]   Follow the line.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.120]   It's getting there.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.200]   Follow the line.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:06.680]   Children.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.440]   You have a Mr.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:08.920]   Jarvis.
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:09.880]   Good light, children.
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:17.320]   We've been relying on, uh, Chrome OS largely in, in our house the past year just for,
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.360]   you know, the school school and everything.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.440]   The Chromebooks that we have have come in very handy.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:30.840]   Although I have, I have one, one criticism that keeps cropping up and that's that,
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:36.440]   uh, this has to do with family, uh, family controls, basically like family time controls.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.560]   Uh, what do they call it?
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.240]   Family link is that.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:43.640]   So each, each of my daughters has a Chromebook that they use for school.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.400]   And we have the Chromebooks.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.960]   So we're, you know, they, they also get iPads from the schools,
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.280]   but most of the time they end up using their Chromebook instead.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.800]   Ah, I pass.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.280]   How old?
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:52.840]   That's.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.320]   They're, they're nice.
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.680]   You know, they've got a keyboard attachment.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.600]   It's just, they, they prefer the Chromebooks.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.080]   And I'm proud.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:04.360]   Um, however, they also have through family link their own tablet, right?
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.960]   They're, they're like personal tablets.
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:09.480]   And of course, if they had it their way, they'd be on their tablets 24/7.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.560]   Uh, I ramp that down.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.240]   My wife and I control that, of course.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.760]   But the problem is in family link, there is no way to, to tell family link, uh, school laptop
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.040]   as much time as they need to do their schoolwork.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.400]   Oh, interesting.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:26.040]   Personal tablets.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.440]   Just the amount of time that I want to give them.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:35.640]   So if I, so if I set it for an hour, let's say, because they only get an hour of tablet time a day,
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:38.760]   then they're in the middle of a Zoom meeting on their, on their Chromebook.
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.280]   And an hour in, it kicks it out and I have to unlock it.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.000]   And there's no easy way to do it.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.440]   What router do you use?
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:50.520]   Cause you could also control that like most internet routing software.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.680]   You can actually do it by device.
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:53.240]   So you could.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:58.840]   Create a profile for your daughters, put their devices that are, their tablets on that.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:49:59.880]   Good idea.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.440]   That's a good idea.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:03.400]   That's probably something built into your sonic mobile app.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:04.760]   Oh, wait.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.120]   You have, yeah.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:08.120]   No, I'm on Comcast now.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:09.000]   Comcast business.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:09.800]   So they do that.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.840]   So Comcast under Xfinity Wi-Fi, if you pay for that and you're using their Wi-Fi,
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.600]   they let you create a family profile.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.560]   It's called X-Fi.
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:18.760]   Yep.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.880]   I've seen it in my app and their app is actually quite good.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.440]   This is like that.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.520]   Okay.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:29.880]   So it's Comcast business, not Comcast Xfinity.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.000]   So we don't have that.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.600]   However, I do have the Eero and the Eero is it.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:34.840]   Okay.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.760]   You could totally totally have it.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.200]   That would totally have it.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.240]   Do you know how to do that?
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:39.960]   Cause I can tell you.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.360]   I'm sure it's, I mean, off the top of my head, I'm, I'm guessing it's in the settings and
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.640]   probably pretty easy.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.160]   I never thought to go that route.
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.080]   I wanted to stay with the Google.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.880]   Go to the plus and add a profile.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:54.600]   And then that's how you're going to do it.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.080]   Perfect.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.440]   That's great.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:59.400]   And then I would just add it for the tablets specifically.
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.800]   I would create whatever for your girls, because if you create a profile for each of them,
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:09.480]   and then add the device, because like, I don't know if they have phones or if you want them
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.680]   not to have access to them.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:15.720]   And then you could just swap things out based on how you feel about their access to things.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.240]   That's a good tip.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:18.680]   Why didn't I think of that?
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.560]   And of course, we're, we're coming up with this right now as they're on their last couple of days
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.600]   of spring break.
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:27.960]   And then they actually return to in person school here in a couple of days.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.480]   That's what we figured is out.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:33.080]   You can still do it for grounding because like with the ear,
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:39.800]   because it's tied into Amazon Echo, you can always just say, turn off so and so's, you know,
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:40.600]   Jane's profile.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.760]   And then boom, it just shuts everything down.
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.640]   Wow.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:47.000]   You're tough.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:47.880]   You're a tough mom.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.000]   I know.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.440]   Oh, best with Stacy.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.120]   That's great.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:54.520]   Thank you.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:55.160]   I'm so excited.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.280]   I could help you, Jason.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.480]   I know.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:58.040]   That's awesome.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:51:58.680]   That's a great tip.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.800]   You helped me all the time.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.440]   Okay.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.440]   All right.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:06.040]   Well, that was a little bonus to the Google change log.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:10.280]   All right.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.880]   We're going to round things out here.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.840]   We got tips, tricks,
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:18.440]   and tricks, numbers, and any other stories that we may have missed coming up next.
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:21.080]   All right.
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:26.840]   So is there anything in the rundown that we have not talked about?
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.040]   They really want to get in there.
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.480]   I see will I am is there?
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.160]   I saw that kind of interesting.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.520]   I got to do a little bit of a Twitter.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.440]   Somebody was yelling about this being awful about the state of the world.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:37.720]   But what is it?
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.200]   It's got an eight.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.680]   What's got an air profile?
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.360]   It's a mask.
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.400]   Air-fuerer flyers.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.840]   Why don't I put it as my thing?
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.520]   Which line are you on?
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:49.560]   Well, this looks like it's 115.
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.280]   Because we can say that since Mr. LaPort isn't here.
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:56.360]   It's your thing, Stacy.
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:57.560]   So you want to do this?
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:58.440]   It's not a thing.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.800]   All right.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:00.280]   It's your thing.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:01.960]   Do what you want to do, Stacy.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:02.280]   All right.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:05.400]   So how about, yeah, tell us a little bit about this, Stacy.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.680]   Okay.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:09.240]   This is not a thing I can show you on my face,
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:10.440]   although I really wish I could.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:15.960]   Will I am teamed up with Honeywell to create the Zuber mask,
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:18.600]   which is a $299 face mask.
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.480]   It's got a silicone over top thing.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.360]   It's got mesh underneath that can, I think, be customized,
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.120]   but we're not 100% sure.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.160]   And it's got Bluetooth with noise canceling headphones
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:32.200]   that are also linked to this mask and the Honeywell filters.
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.640]   To be clear, the Honeywell filters do not,
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:39.240]   Honeywell is not saying that they do filter out the coronavirus.
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:40.520]   They're just saying they're HEPA filters,
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:43.160]   which I'm cool with pollen season.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:43.800]   You know, great.
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.480]   I'm sure it does something.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.120]   Well, it does as much as a cloth filter.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:48.840]   It does a quality-
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.960]   Well, it probably does more,
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:52.200]   it probably does more than a cloth mask.
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:52.680]   Okay.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:53.000]   Sure.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.520]   There's more than this thing right here.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.440]   Sure.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.040]   Yeah, probably a little more than that.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.080]   Maybe.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:01.240]   So, yeah, and this is a prototype.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.200]   They're going to do drops just like they do with fancy sneakers.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.920]   At first, I was like, okay,
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.560]   and it looks freaking dystopian as heck.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.280]   It does.
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:15.160]   I mean, it looks like Mad Max meets Adidas.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:17.000]   But.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.120]   It's like a Google Daydream viewer, but for your mouth.
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:22.920]   For your mouth.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:23.400]   For your mouth.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.040]   It knows.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:25.560]   But.
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:26.840]   But.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.240]   I was thinking about this and I'm like, you know what?
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.480]   If we go into a culture where we wear masks all the time,
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:35.000]   the fact that it's got the earbuds,
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.680]   it's got an integrated microphone in there.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.480]   So you could like,
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.280]   and I'm thinking maybe not for like walking around the grocery store,
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.120]   but what if you're sitting in your office,
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.800]   you know, and you've got to wear your mask all day?
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:45.640]   Actually, it doesn't.
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.280]   I wouldn't mind the ventilation.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:51.160]   So I'm just throwing that out there.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:51.960]   Is it?
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.320]   Do I think it's going to be?
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.760]   I mean, I would not wear it, but.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:57.320]   It's not as crazy as it seems.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:58.760]   Although I wish you would.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.520]   I would focus on week vessel.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.600]   What would you wear it?
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.040]   Why wouldn't I wear it?
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:04.760]   Right.
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:07.000]   Because I think it is hideously ugly and also.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.920]   Yeah, mostly because I think I don't want that.
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:13.080]   That looks like something's attacking your face.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:15.320]   It just maybe it's comfortable.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.720]   And if it is, I might change my mind.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:18.360]   It's also expensive.
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:18.840]   It has it.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:21.880]   Definitely has a game or aesthetic to it.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.880]   Yeah, it was like to me.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.240]   But maybe you could make that all black.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:29.720]   You could get better.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.200]   That'd be better.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:31.400]   Yeah, good.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:33.720]   Different color ways.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:40.600]   Yeah, like maybe you go to the game tournaments of the future
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.440]   and everybody in the room is wearing one of these while they're playing.
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.120]   Whatever it is they're playing.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:47.240]   I don't know.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.640]   It looks very futuristic and $300, right?
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.000]   Is that the cost for this?
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.080]   Yeah, but I mean, like if the headphones are good,
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:55.800]   I just spent what?
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:58.440]   It was $200 on the Jabra's $85.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:55:59.160]   Were they too?
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:55:59.560]   Totally.
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.200]   So I mean, if I hadn't spent that or if these like,
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.160]   if I could get that kind of mask with the Jabra sound to it.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:10.040]   And it wasn't a scary looking.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:16.120]   It's got LED lights.
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:17.160]   No, it's got LED lights.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:18.200]   Why does it do LED lights?
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:19.720]   That's the thing that's goes too far.
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.680]   I don't, it doesn't do LED lights.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.600]   No, I walk around in the dark all the time.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:27.880]   I actually have the most stupid crazy LED stuff now.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.160]   It is beyond silly.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.320]   That sounds so bizarre.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.880]   There's no street lights where I am.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:36.120]   And when it gets dark at like four o'clock in the winter.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:36.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:37.320]   All right.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.280]   Why were I were saying you're walking around house in a dark now?
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:43.400]   No, I'm like, I've got like,
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.200]   rave wear.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.080]   Like I have this like,
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.400]   it's like literally an LED vest.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:48.760]   It's got LED lights here.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.520]   It's got them up and down my back.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.400]   And I can program it with an app to do patterns.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.280]   It's ridiculous.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.240]   Oh, nice.
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.440]   Oh, man.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.120]   We actually, Stacy, would you send that to me?
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:00.280]   Do you want one?
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:02.440]   I can send you a link to it.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:02.680]   Yes.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:03.480]   I mean, send me the link.
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.720]   I mean, it's great.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:06.360]   People definitely.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.240]   I go out at night too.
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:09.240]   And I'm in the country too.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:11.960]   Let me, let me find out.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.920]   Let me go find out.
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:13.480]   Please.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:15.320]   Add me to that list too, please.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:15.880]   All right.
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:18.440]   Stacy's just being super helpful today.
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.280]   What kinds of tips?
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.560]   What's going on?
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.040]   Geez.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:24.440]   Hey, Stacy, you're usually so cranky.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:28.360]   This is gross.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.520]   Robot and Chad brings up the question.
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:35.080]   How do you clean these masks that are so tall?
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:36.280]   Like electronics?
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.320]   That's where you get those fancy UV light things that.
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:40.760]   Yes.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:41.480]   I don't know.
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:43.720]   I'm just like, yeah, I don't know.
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:48.200]   I have to clean my CPAP thing with ozone.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:51.800]   Oh.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:52.120]   OK.
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.080]   That's funny.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.200]   You mentioned CPAP.
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:59.000]   I saw the other day a CPAP that only connects.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.320]   It's like the little thing that connects just to your nose.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.040]   It's BS.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:02.600]   It's BS.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.320]   It's a totally BS.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.600]   I wondered if it was.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.320]   I was like, how could you replace like this huge CPAP thing
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.960]   that is just the way it is right now with this thing that you want?
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.920]   I got tempted because I hated my CPAP thing and it surprised it.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:16.280]   And there was a Kickstarter campaign to actually do that.
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:20.680]   It had many fans and they had a whole thing and they raised,
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:23.240]   I don't know, a million and a half and never did a thing.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.280]   It's one of the big ones that never happened because they can't.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:30.840]   So what happened was people copied the design, the look of it.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.040]   And all it does is like have a flat bedded or something.
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:34.920]   It doesn't really do anything.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.360]   OK.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.080]   Well, I just did.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:42.680]   I imagined like something that small wouldn't have enough air pressure to actually open up.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.960]   Well, you don't need a lot of pressure.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:45.640]   You just need kind of a constant flow.
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:46.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:53.320]   And so this Kickstarter thing had these small baffles with a tiny battery
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:58.840]   that would create some flow up your news and keep you breathing.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:03.240]   See, Paps are no fun.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.320]   I am man sleeping myself.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:08.040]   Man sleeping.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:11.720]   I forgot about that terminology.
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:13.160]   So tired.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:14.920]   That's a nice callback to the beginning of the show.
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:18.120]   Completely spaced out one.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:22.120]   Well, Jeff, what's your number?
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.160]   I'm going to give you two stuff.
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:23.640]   Oh, I'm going to give you two stuff.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:24.200]   What you got?
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:24.440]   Two.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:31.800]   First, the serious one is the Andreessen Horowitz marketplace ratings.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:32.840]   I did this a year ago.
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:34.120]   This is the second year they've done this.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:38.200]   And if you go and open that up and then you go to the bottom of the top,
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.920]   whatever number it is and say more, it'll go to the full list.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:46.600]   And what fascinated me last year was these are the top marketplaces out there.
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:49.400]   How few of them I know and use.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:51.800]   Maybe I'm just so incredibly un-hipped.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:55.880]   Instacart, I use constantly for my father to do things for him.
[01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:01.000]   I lose out pretty quickly in this list.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.440]   Master of last week.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:02.440]   Yeah, me too.
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:05.720]   I've never heard of Valve.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.600]   Valve is the internet game.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:10.520]   The internet game.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.120]   It's a game thing.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:14.120]   These are the top marketplaces.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.400]   Most of these are huge.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:17.000]   And I have never heard of them.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.120]   There's a whole world out there.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:18.680]   I don't want to say it.
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:20.840]   Go to Streetwear.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:22.520]   I don't think you can see me in Streetwear.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:23.480]   I don't think it worked very well.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.600]   I tow made the list interesting.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.360]   I've got to do a lot of stock.
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:35.160]   Footage and stock assets for content.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:35.640]   So what it is?
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.440]   A lot of education was here.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:43.880]   A course hero, Udemy, Coursera.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.840]   That's why I got those.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:47.240]   Delivery dudes.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.200]   Never heard of that.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.240]   Madsy home services.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:52.440]   Cameo and bottle the name.
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:53.960]   Oh, I'm, Mazi was one of my things.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.080]   Was it?
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:55.480]   Oh.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.760]   Yeah, it's a designer.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:57.640]   It's a design thing.
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:59.720]   Oh, see, you're a paper that I have.
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:01.480]   So I just, I just think this is interesting.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:01.960]   Shocking.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:04.760]   So, and camp is on there.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:05.800]   Love Bandcamp.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.280]   That's it.
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:06.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.360]   The other one to do, I love this.
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:11.320]   There's a video to play on line 135,
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.600]   if you would have the honors.
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:15.160]   One of you.
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:16.040]   Let's see here.
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:17.480]   Well, I just love this.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:18.520]   That would be John.
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.760]   Mr. Jammerby has it.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.640]   Mr. Jammerby, can you pull up 135 and play that?
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:25.960]   Let's see here.
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.760]   Audio, restart with audio.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.680]   It's only.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.800]   Audio is a problem.
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:36.120]   Second.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.000]   That might be a problem.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:37.960]   Two.
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:38.600]   Two.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:39.160]   Okay, wait, wait.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:39.720]   Okay.
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:40.440]   Okay, ready.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:49.720]   Somebody had a sense of humor here at LuPods.
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:52.680]   Because it's flight two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:53.000]   Toulouse.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.880]   I just, I just love that.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:01.080]   Like two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two.
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:01.560]   Toulouse.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:05.400]   That, that kind of sounds like a remix,
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:07.720]   just waiting to happen.
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:08.360]   Two.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:08.760]   Isn't that great?
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:09.800]   Two, two, two, two, two, two.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.000]   Yeah, something along those lines.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:11.640]   I just love it.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:12.360]   I love it.
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:16.680]   In Jeff and Ant, I put the link in the chat for the best days.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.600]   Thank you, ma'am.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:19.320]   Thank you, ma'am.
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:20.280]   Oh, no.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.320]   Wish chat.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.040]   The Zoom chat?
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.480]   I don't know the, oh, no, not the Zoom chat.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:26.840]   I hold up.
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:28.360]   I put it in the Twitch chat.
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:29.960]   But here I can put it in the Zoom chat too.
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:33.640]   I share with everybody, I don't just share with y'all.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:35.880]   Oh, no, the Twitch chat.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:36.680]   I'm sorry, okay.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:38.840]   Okay, the Twitch chat, not the not the run down chat.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.320]   Never mind.
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.040]   Thank you, got it.
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.400]   Thank you.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.360]   Oh, my.
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:45.080]   All right.
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:46.120]   Let's see here.
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:47.240]   So, Anne, what you got?
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.440]   I have a couple things.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:54.280]   And the first thing I like to tell people to,
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.960]   if you can avoid it, stop taking painkillers.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.120]   I know people have aches and pains, but
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:06.440]   painkillers can be quite addictive and lead to a whole host
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.320]   of problems.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:16.680]   And I had my hip replaced several years ago and battled with pain management and things like that.
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.560]   But I found a couple of different ways to try to manage pain.
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:23.640]   And this here is something that I got my hands on fairly recently.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.200]   I was hoping I could do a review about it,
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.000]   but I figured you know what?
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.360]   I can at least give them a shout out in this Delumour Care duo.
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.360]   I have it here in my studio.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.680]   This is a really nice device.
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.680]   And it uses lasers to help manage pain.
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:43.400]   I talked about this on my previous show,
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:49.080]   Hands on Wellness, being able to use lasers and other types of pain management devices to
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.720]   actually, you know, activate the nerves and the proteins and cells inside of your body
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.160]   to help manage pain to keep you from just popping pills.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:00.040]   Because all those pills are doing is just tricking your brain.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:07.480]   They're not healing anything and they're just giving you more of an addiction opportunity.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.080]   But this thing is pretty intuitive.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.680]   Works for muscles and skin and joint pain.
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:14.840]   It's got three different settings here.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:19.000]   You just toggle through and you can do treatments five minutes at a time.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.960]   It's not something that you do, you know, for 20 minutes, half an hour, anything like that.
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.480]   Just do this a couple times a day.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:32.040]   I've tried it out because I battle with the wrist and forearm issues because I do a lot of pushups
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:35.480]   and I carry cameras all day and eventually my grip gets weak.
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:40.360]   And I found that just playing with this for the last several weeks does make a difference.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.920]   And then you can see it automatically shuts off if it's idle.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:46.040]   So yeah, this is a pretty slick device.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.960]   So shout out to Lumour Care for again trying to get people to stop taking so many
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:59.320]   dad gum pain pills and allowing these pharmaceutical companies to just continue to profit off of us
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:02.520]   and turn us into low-end drug users.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:09.240]   And lastly, well secondly, my other picks are go watch my show hands on photography.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.120]   TV slash.
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.440]   Spend a lot of fun.
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:13.560]   Had a couple of interviews.
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:19.480]   I have another interview coming up really soon that I can't wait to check it out.
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:25.240]   But my last one I talked with Mr. Freddy Clark about food photography and beverage photography.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:28.680]   And this man just does some amazing work.
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:32.440]   And a lot of it is just based on lighting and just how you set up your lights.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:35.880]   And I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm getting close.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.400]   I'm going to figure out one of these days.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:42.840]   And also in that episode, we alluded to a workshop that I've been invited to.
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.600]   And that is the Wanderers Photo Excursion.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:48.520]   And that's wanderersphoto.com.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:55.320]   Myself, Mr. Andrew Scravani, Mr. Steve Brazel, Mr. Freddy Clark, we are all going to be your
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:58.440]   instructors for this workshop in New Orleans.
[02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:04.040]   I will be focusing more on street photography as well as cityscapes.
[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:10.040]   And part of the street photography, we have a second line band in New Orleans that's going to
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:15.320]   be there and allow us to do a shoot of them as they march through the streets of New Orleans,
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:19.240]   just doing their thing with their instruments. And that's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:23.320]   energy to capture through your lens. And I can't wait. That's in October.
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:26.760]   So go ahead and get yourself registered and join this workshop.
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:31.320]   That's amazing. What a great opportunity. That sounds like a lot of fun.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.560]   Oh, yeah, I cannot wait.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:35.480]   Yeah, I bet.
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:40.440]   And when did you say that was again?
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:46.520]   That's in October, I believe it's October the 12th. I cannot remember.
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:49.240]   It's October 10th.
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:53.560]   This is 14th. That's it. Still just thinking like that's that's going to be nice for you,
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:58.680]   I imagine, to be able to, you know, go to New Orleans after after the year that we've had.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:02.120]   Yeah, I feel like a normal traveler again.
[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:06.120]   All right. And then just the street photography because I love street photography.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:11.800]   That's that's probably my favorite thing to shoot beyond just studio portraits,
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:17.160]   because street photography allows you to take a scene that's totally innocuous and
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:22.680]   paying a story. You know, one of my favorite all time shots is the
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:27.400]   of this lady that I took a photo of in Charlotte several years ago.
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:32.920]   And it's in black and white, and she's just standing there outside of the train station.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:38.760]   And she has her baby in this little carrier. And she's just sort of hanging out.
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:44.760]   And the baby is just totally napping. Just it's just such a peaceful scene.
[02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:48.120]   The baby is like, you know what? I'm outside the sun shining on me.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:50.680]   I'm going to catch me a real good nap right now with my mom.
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:55.800]   Just I love that shot. And I just love being able to see stuff like that
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:08:00.040]   out in everyday life with street photography. You know, that's the kind of stuff you can't just
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:05.160]   stage, you know. So yeah, it's going to be fun and new Orleans.
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:09.800]   All right on. Never been to New Orleans. One of these days I've always wanted to do it.
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:13.400]   No, me neither. This will be my first time down there.
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:16.040]   Huh. All right. We'll have fun, y'all.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.920]   Food. Eat and drink and be merry.
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:25.400]   I plan on it. Yeah, I plan on it. Awesome. Look forward to that.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:36.520]   So my thing actually the initial embargo on this lifted this morning and it is a wearable.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:43.720]   It is a the one plus watch. Which one plus, you know, they announced the nine and the nine
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:49.240]   pro, the one plus nine and the one plus nine pro weeks ago at the same announcement.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:54.040]   They also announced the one plus watch, but they, you know, they hadn't sent it out.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:59.560]   They weren't ready to kind of like take the, you know, go completely to the point of putting it
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:06.280]   in people's, well, putting it on people's arms yet. And this morning, so basically the embargo
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:11.720]   today is basically just showing that it exists and talking a little bit about the hardware.
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:16.040]   I've been using it for a few days, but I can't really talk about the experience necessarily,
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:21.240]   but I can kind of show it off because as you can see, it's a little like it's, it's definitely a
[02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:25.480]   large watch. Thickness wise though, I'm trying to, my camera is a little far away.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:30.120]   So it's kind of hard to hold for you. Yeah, this working. Thickness wise, it's not like
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:35.720]   a crazy thick smartwatch compared to some of them that I've had on my wrist before.
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:45.560]   But you can see just like the size of it, it's a pretty large and wide smartwatch. So 46 millimeter
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:53.080]   stainless steel casing. Oh, that's what I want. Yeah, it's a nice profile, I have to say, but
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:58.920]   I think it's probably going to be for certain size wrists, essentially. It's not going to work
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.560]   for every wrist. One gig of RAM, four gigs of storage, two of those four gigs are accessible
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:10.280]   for things like music and stuff. You can move music onto here and then, you know, connect a
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:16.840]   Bluetooth, a Bluetooth headphone directly to it. And so you can stream your music and leave your
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:22.920]   phone at home when you go for a run, that sort of thing. 402 milliamp hour battery does have a
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:27.800]   charging puck. So you just drop it right on the charging puck and, you know, it starts charging.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:38.520]   And IP68. So that's water and dust resistance. So it's a pretty, you know, this is really there.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:45.240]   It seems like they're targeting this for for active for active people. So, you know, there's more
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:52.200]   than 110 different workout types that you can that you can support with this different modes
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:57.560]   for tracking different types of workouts and, you know, you're running pace and all that kind of
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:03.880]   stuff. You know, maybe you're in the gym or maybe you play cricket. I noticed that cricket is a
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:12.200]   setting. So if you play cricket, you're you're solid here. GPS does blood oxygen saturation,
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:18.760]   monitoring, stress detection, breathing, training, rapid heart rate alerts. It does the thing where,
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.320]   you know, after an hour, it tells you to get up and walk around. So you got that as well.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:29.000]   $159. So it's not that price is what gets me. That's that's awesome.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.840]   Yeah, that is that is a night. That's a lot of good features for that price.
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.800]   Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, one plus has long been the value brand. There's a lot of people
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:44.920]   wondering if maybe that value brand identity is is on the way out with their phones, you know,
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:49.080]   because their phones keep getting more and more expensive. But definitely it seems like with the
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:55.560]   with the wearable at that price on her $59 they offer a lot within this smartwatch. So
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:04.840]   available now with the wearable. Right. They have believe they announced no wear OS. This
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.560]   this is running Android, but they're not officially, you know, it's not officially running wear
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:15.320]   OS, Google's where OS can I see it is Android OS. Okay, it's okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:21.960]   And yeah, available for purchase April 14th. So I have obviously have the screen set.
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:26.680]   Oh, yeah, see, I've got my music and I could stream that through to my my headphones. And it looks
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:32.760]   snappy too. Yeah. Yeah, it's a night. I gotta say it's a it's a sharp looking design. It's
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:39.000]   not bad, and especially for $159. So I'm going to be doing a full review of this for hands on tech
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:50.680]   next week is is my hope. So, yeah, I guess I'll call it a tease more more coming on this at some
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:56.040]   point next week. But you can you can purchase it yourself. April 14th, if you want to get on it,
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:03.000]   that's exactly a month or sorry, a week away from today. So yeah, the OnePlus watch. There you are,
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:11.320]   $59. Not a bad price. All right. And that's that's what I got. And I think that's what we got. I
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:17.000]   think we're at the end of this episode of this week in Google, always a lot of fun. Thank you.

[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:38.120]   should. But when I do, it's it's really great to see people talking about what we're doing and
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:43.400]   also just talking with each other about yeah, it's just random conversations. And it's not always
