[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Along with Jeff and Gina will talk about Chrome.

[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Apparently Google had a big hand in that.

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   here from smarterware.org, founding editor at Life Hacker
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and the author of Think Up and to-do text, Hi, Gina.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hi, so glad to be here. Welcome back, Leo.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   First of all about Android.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yeah, it's nice to be back. Thank you guys for filling in for me.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Gina, Gina is the one who did the yeoman's effort.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I think that last week, so it was all good.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You think?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I think, Jeff Finkie-Garvis, Jarvis.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And somebody on Twitter suggested Leo that neither you nor I
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   was welcome back because Gina did something to me.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Well, and that's the sad fact of the matter is that Gina's too
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   damn good.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I was nervous, you guys.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm really happy you're both here today.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I was told to get a shrink by this guy.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Aww.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You got to a very big battle going, was going on
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   while I was gone between Jeff and some listener.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And I wanted to just say, just ignore that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Jeff, I get that every day.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Oh, that was amazing.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah, that was what the guy spent a lot of time writing that email.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You know, basically there's an inverse proportion to the
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   intelligence of the email and the length of it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I found.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Or to the life existing outside the strange world.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Anyway.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, for engaged listeners.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Well, we're glad they're engaged.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yes, we are.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You see, this is why Gina's so good.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   She found the silver lining.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah, I, but I answered back and it was all about the, and I
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   didn't do it again.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   See, you shouldn't answer because it doesn't.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That's the problem because then he said, well, you only answer
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   one line.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Now, that's it.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I've lost you as a fan.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm gone.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah, I had that the other day.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I had this.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's just weird.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's just weird people.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I think that the, what we, what, here's what I would suggest.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I'm not going to call this guy out or by any means.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   In fact, we appreciate people's feedback.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Yeah, I mean, cares about the show and I love that.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He just cares about Google Reader a little too much.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The, the, the thing I've noticed about the internet in general is
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   that we assume that everybody out there is like us.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   God help the world.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Well, we just, you just assume, hey, I'm having a conversation
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   with somebody there, they're rational, normal people, but you
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   know, the world is full of, of a broad variety of types and not
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   everybody is normal.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Everybody has their buttons, you know, like everybody has a
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   button and sometimes you say something kind of a toss off joke
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   or a comment or whatever and it just presses somebody's button
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   on something that's sensitive for them at the moment or for whatever
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   reason and, and then yeah, then things get weird.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And maybe he was having a bad day, you know, sometimes you have a
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   bad day.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   His dog died, his wife left him, train ran over his car, whatever
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and he decided to take it out on you.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   So I just ignore those.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But you know, it's the same thing and when you're in a chat
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   room or a forum or whatever, you just assume everybody's normal
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and they're not, they're looning tunes out there.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   They're crazy.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   No, I'm just being, I'm being silly.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Stranger danger.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Stranger danger.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis, Buzz machine.com.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   He's also professor of journalism at the City University of
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   New York.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I met somebody on the cruise, a young woman who is a writer.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   She's actually writing for like the New Yorker and the nation.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And I, and I mentioned you, Jeff and I said, you know, it's good to
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   see somebody succeeding in journalism.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   This is a difficult profession these days.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But what she's, what's been interesting is she's writing a lot
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   for online now.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I guess that's what you do.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   That's what you do.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Of course, there's not as much money in online, but we're going
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   to fix that.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   All right.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   What do you want to talk about?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Did anything happen while I was gone?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Nothing.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Nothing really.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Nothing.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   No.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   There's a new Chromebook, right?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I'm excited about that.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   They're cool too.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   They are cool.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They really look nice.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   They look like they're well engineered.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The best thing about them.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Charge with USB.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   That is so interesting.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Isn't that cool?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So this is a, from HP.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We kind of talked about this.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   This is the one we talked about.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But Google helped them.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So there's a blessing here.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   The only problem is it has the same tech specs essentially as the
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   old Samsung one, which though nice was just too slow to handle
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   to the top.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's low end.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's low end.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's not.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's not.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   What do you expect?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It charges with a USB micro USB.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Wow.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   That is neat.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   That is so smart.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's the only charge.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It lasts.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now, I probably charge it slowly because there's not a lot of
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   wattage on that sucker.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You know, most laptops have 40, 50, 100 watt power supplies.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   The most you can get out of USB is around 10 watts.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And that directly impacts charge time.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So I'm not sure what they're doing there on that one.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But we'll see.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   We'll get one.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We'll review it.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I like the colors, Google colors.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You know, I generally think that this whole color thing is such a
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   gimmick and I never, you know, whatever.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I never think much, make much of colors.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But I really like that the way they did the colors on these,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   their accents versus, you know, the whole thing.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And those, those bands, those colored bands you're seeing,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   that's actually the bottom of the machine.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So that those are like the rubber grips, right?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So they're kind of two tone and it could be yellow and white or
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   green and white or red and white, whatever, whatever you like.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Or if you're really boring by black.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Right.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Or just plain black.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And it's got the little rainbow across the top.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I love it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Like the pixel has.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Now I wonder if that lights up the same way as the pixel.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I think you have to pick a few other bucks for that.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   No.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Did you read the article in Business Insider about the birth of the
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   pixel?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   That was kind of interesting.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Cesar sent Google.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   As Chromebooks.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Chromebooks.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Chromebooks in general.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Yes.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Cesar sent Gupta.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He said the Chromebook thing started as a 20% project for him.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   His day job was running Google toolbar and Google desktop.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   But he wanted to do a little bit of hardware.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   He was actually saying the issue for him was these crappy,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   slow boot bioses.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Amen.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It was still checking.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I love it.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It was still checking for floppy drives.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He said it's 2009 computers take five to six minutes to boot.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And partly because it's going.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Is there a floppy?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So when he got the fast BIOS to boot in eight or nine seconds,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   it was like, wow.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   This is how you work.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So they asked a business insider, Julie Bort, doing this interview,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.100]   was there a moment when Larry or Sergey saw that and said, let's build PCs?
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.960]   And Cesar said something I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.880]   Google doesn't really function with a single executive.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.040]   It's a very bottoms up culture.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.320]   The way it works, people start moving to the project.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.760]   Once people saw our initial demo, we had engineers going around saying, hey, can we
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.560]   help you?
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.320]   The projects at Google typically get staffed initially like this.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.720]   At some point, you get to this critical mass and it gets much easier to get resources.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.840]   It's a very interesting way of doing things.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.240]   You have to get the buy-in of your peers before you even can talk to Larry or Sergey about.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   It is, though.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.920]   It suffers the risk that you have a lot of products that are built for people who work
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   at Google.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   Yes.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   Right.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   Right.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   Which is the pixel.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.360]   It's just a redgitated, smart engineer type.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.960]   Which is not a bad thing, but there's inherent kind of...
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.560]   There's inherent bias there.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.360]   He said, I know if a project successful, when I see other Googlers using it, he says, this
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   year is one of those years where suddenly Googlers are starting to carry around Chromebooks
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.160]   and of course, that's the pixel, I'm sure.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.560]   He says, the pixel is something that's used by a very large number of Googlers, so he
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.800]   knows we've succeeded.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.680]   Well, that's not the only metric in the world.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.840]   It's not, but selfishly that gives me hope that they'll do a new version using the Haswell
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   chip.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.080]   Dogfooding it.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.040]   I have to say, and this might be a little bit of a retrenching on my part, a little bit
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.800]   of apologizing.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   Not in general about the pixel.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.280]   I still think that's really too expensive, but I do think the Chromebooks, right now schools
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.120]   are adopting Chromebooks fast and things are going crazy.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.560]   I watched the Chromebook group on Google+, and it's just amazing to see what the educators
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.080]   are doing with them and just the numbers involved, the hundreds they're buying.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   I think that's good.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.720]   I think it is, in fact, a perfect school computer.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   Much better.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.520]   We talked on the show some time ago when LA got iPads, $1 worth of iPad.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.920]   There was a story about what a disaster it is, which we predicted.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.560]   The kids hacked it within days.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.920]   All the security software they build in there to keep kids from doing anything good with
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   their iPads.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.040]   The first thing the kids go is, "No, that's not going to go.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   That's not going to fly."
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.800]   They hacked it immediately.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.880]   Of course.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.800]   But that's the beauty of a Chromebook.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   I guess you could put, I mean, if you're really good, you could put Linux on it and make it
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.200]   a full service computer, but really no.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's a browser.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.600]   Now, Google's going the other way.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:42.320]   We mentioned before I left that Chrome apps on Windows, but apparently they're starting
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.760]   to build Chrome OS right into Windows 8.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.440]   I'm trying to get my head around.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.520]   I don't understand how they're doing this without Microsoft.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.360]   I was so hoping you just explain it for me.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.400]   I was trying to get my head around what's going on here.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   This is a verge story.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.160]   They're saying that Chrome traditionally runs on the desktop in Windows 8.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.280]   This is giving developers the ability to set Chrome to launch within Windows 8 start screen
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.240]   in a special Metro style mode.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.920]   So, this is something Microsoft allowed and encouraged.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.480]   Kind of remember ActiveX, the idea that you could have Internet-based apps.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.480]   Right.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.280]   So this is something Microsoft actually created.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.200]   It's a Windows 8 special mode.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.720]   For browsers, it lets browsers basically be part of the OS.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.320]   Which is kind of incredible on so many different levels.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.960]   I mean, when you think about, I mean, I think it's great that Windows allowed this and
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.200]   that Microsoft is encouraging this.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.440]   I'm still trying to understand why.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.760]   I guess a developer.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.760]   So, okay.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.840]   So you're saying you can start Chrome when Windows starts, right?
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.120]   So that users can then click on an icon, a web app icon in the start menu to launch it
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.120]   as if it's a native app.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.640]   As if it's a native app.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.520]   So in other words, you can assume that Chrome services are available.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   Right.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.320]   Now, you don't have to do anything.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.840]   So in addition to the Windows API and all the things you could do in Windows, you could
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.000]   assume a certain number of Chrome services are also available.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I mean, I don't know if that.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.440]   Does it be turned on for users automatically?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.000]   Or is it a system that would be a service that would start?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Well, they'd have to install.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.040]   They'd have to install Chrome OS, Chrome layer, whatever, right.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   Right.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.120]   And it may be that if they install one of these Metro Chrome apps that it says, you know,
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.680]   it brings in a DLL called Chrome.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.080]   I don't know exactly how it works.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.880]   So do you have an -- but then you have web apps within the web app, within the micro -- within
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   the Chrome app?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.360]   Yeah, they look -- no, you don't see Chrome running.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   That's what's so weird about it.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.600]   Yeah, you don't see Chrome running, right.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.520]   They can just be full -- they appear to be Windows that are just like native app windows.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.280]   I feel like, you know, there's so many companies that just tried this over and over again.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.840]   I mean, you have like Mac OS 10 with those widgets which are web-based.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.280]   And we've seen widgets on like the Vista and Windows 7 desktops.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.320]   We've seen Adobe Air.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.440]   Like that, you know, we've seen so many sort of run times that let developers make these,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.120]   you know, web, you know, these widgets are applicative native-like applications with
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   web technologies.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.240]   I just over and over we see them, you know, happen.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.840]   And they never really have caught on so far.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.600]   I think TweetTech was the only like Air app, Adobe Air app that I use a lot.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.040]   And actually now it's a Chrome app.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040]   I use the Chrome app.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   Right.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   That's the Chrome app.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   Right.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.800]   They've always just been more of a novelty than something that users have really dug into.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.280]   Well, at least that's my impression.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.000]   It does feel like a Trojan horse a little bit.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.480]   But Microsoft's not stupid.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   They know what they're doing.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.800]   They know what Google's doing.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.960]   Well, Chrome's a big browser.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:49.640]   I mean, you know, if you're just too limited and can't use a browser you like and a Microsoft
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.320]   product at some level, I'm sure.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.840]   I'm sure this kind of capability is there for Internet Explorer, right?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.080]   It's amazing though, given the market share that Internet Explorer had, you know, back
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.760]   in the day that this is happening right now.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:10.000]   I saw this on, I get PBS Frontline did like a Steve Jobs thing this week because of, you
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.520]   know, it was the anniversary of his death.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.080]   And I think it was Mossberg.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.840]   Mossberg was saying they had interviewed him.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.440]   And he was saying that he really liked both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates very much as people.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.680]   They were both kind of difficult to work for.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.160]   Steve was more fun to be around.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.120]   You know, Gates was a lot more technical.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.480]   The one comparison that he made between the two companies is that like Microsoft was always
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.880]   improving things incrementally.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   They're always making incremental changes, whereas Apple was always taking a very long
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:45.160]   view and trying to reach like very big what seemed to be almost impossible goals and that
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.280]   that's what he really liked about Steve and Apple kind of more than Microsoft.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.760]   And so, you know, it's interesting.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.200]   And he said, you know, this is why Microsoft lost their foothold.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.520]   Like completely missed the internet basically because they were so busy sort of concentrating
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.520]   on office, shipping office, right, which was their big, you know, revenue maker.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.240]   And so it's interesting to see Microsoft coming around to this place where they're, you know,
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.160]   bundling Chrome into Metro because this is the browser.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.880]   And there was another piece, there was another piece I think in the Times this week about
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.320]   the guy who's in charge of Microsoft Cloud and we'd be in the World of the Cloud show.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   And how that's a big cultural change for them is not to push the OS, but to push the idea
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.120]   of working on the cloud and that's hard for Microsoft too.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.520]   Well, Apple, it's not like Apple's not going to come up against hard times too.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.360]   I mean, what's hard is to be a successful tech company and then reinvent yourself every
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.760]   five years as is required these days.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   Indeed.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.760]   Indeed.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.480]   It was required for Apple to come back from the dead, right?
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   Right.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.640]   And I don't know.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.400]   I don't, did you guys read the New York Times magazine on Sunday, the article about Steve
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.800]   Jobs and the iPhone?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.200]   Wow.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.760]   You got to read this.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.040]   We talked about it on Macbreak weekly yesterday.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.680]   It's from a book that Fred Vogelstein who's at Wired Magazine is writing right now about
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   Apple.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.040]   Or it's an excerpt from a book.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.960]   And he, let's see, the book name, let me get, I should give Fred full credit on this.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:20.560]   The book name is Dogfight, how Apple and Google went to war and started a revolution.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.440]   But part of it is about the iPhone.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:28.360]   He interviews Andy Grignon, who was an engineer who was one of the chief designers of the
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.680]   radios in the first iPhone.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:37.880]   And he talks about what a hairball it was and how difficult it was to do.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.920]   And in fact, they talk a lot about the unveiling of the iPhone.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.720]   The first, this is 2007 of the first iPhone and how it didn't work.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.360]   There was a magic path that Jobs would have to follow because Jobs wanted to show the browser,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.880]   show an email and make a couple of phone calls.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.920]   And the phone would crash if you try to do that.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.280]   So there was a magic path that Jobs had to follow to the letter or it would crash.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.400]   And time and time again in rehearsals, it crashed, it crashed, it crashed, and Jobs is
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   getting more and more angry.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   He's looking at people and says, "You are effing up my company."
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.040]   But it's a very dramatic story.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.440]   And in fact, it's very funny because Grignon says, "I brought a bottle of scotch to this
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.080]   demo because we had no idea if this was going to fly."
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.360]   And every time a part of the demo worked, the guy who was responsible for that took
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.360]   a shot.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.600]   I mean, we're all in the audience here.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   We didn't see this.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.280]   This is all going on in the fifth row.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.200]   And he said, "By the end of the demo, it was the best demo I'd ever seen in my life."
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.000]   And in fact, I think everybody agrees.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.840]   This was Steve Jobs at his finest, this initial iPhone announcement.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   And he said, "We were all wasted."
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.520]   He said, "The rest of the day was completely written off."
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.720]   But the method, and the reason I bring this up is the message I got from this incredible
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:01.320]   piece which I highly recommend is that without some guy like Steve Jobs just kicking ass,
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.120]   cracking the whip, inspiring people because you can't just do that because people go,
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   "Well, screw you, Steve.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   I'm out of here."
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.920]   But inspiring people really saying, "You've got to give me everything.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.800]   You're going to lose your family.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   You're going to lose your life.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.280]   I'm going to have you for the next five years, 24/7, but we're going to change the world."
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.720]   And people did it.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.480]   And without a guy like that behind it, it's pretty hard for a tech company to survive.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.720]   And I think it's even harder for a second act.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   I mean, Steve had several acts.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.640]   That's also the top down view.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.320]   If you go back to what you read about the Chromebook, there is it.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.440]   Google has so goddamn big that there is some level of bottom up.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.760]   There is some level of people creating Chromebooks or Google News or whatever these things are.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.200]   They can still bubble up there.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.880]   And I'm sure it's hard and I'm sure it's gotten too big and all that's probably true.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.440]   But there are still inventions from within that aren't controlled just for one person
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   at the top.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.480]   Oh, I completely agree.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.080]   And I think this is intentional on Larry's part.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.680]   I think Larry Page knows this.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   Everybody knows this.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   It's the innovative dilemma.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.480]   It knows the challenge that as you get successful and you get big, how hard it is to stay nimble.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.760]   And I'm sure Larry saw this as a systems problem and said, "How can we design a company of
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:22.440]   a hundred thousand employees that is innovative and is exciting as a startup?"
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.200]   And what he's done, it seems to me, has created a lot of mini startups within the company.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.920]   Because it's kind of like this headless company.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.760]   And if you're in charge of a product, it's almost like it's your own company.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.360]   Which now Microsoft did this and failed.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.400]   Google has the problem of you get announcements that are in the timeframes conflict.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.360]   We've talked about this before, different companies.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.480]   It's like different companies within the same company.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.640]   Apple had this unitary vision where it, no, no, it's all top down.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.840]   Microsoft tried to do this thing where you have a bunch of dictators.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.520]   But each of them is because of the stack ranking system.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.240]   This is Dvorak's theory and I think he's probably right.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.640]   Each of them is fighting for their life.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   It's like survivor.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.120]   You don't want to be kicked off the island.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   So they're killing each other.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.120]   They're shooting at each other.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:17.120]   You know, saying office succeeds only if the iPad apps fail, etc., etc.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.880]   And so nobody can succeed.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.680]   All of this is an attempt to solve the same problem.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.000]   But for Apple that's used to that structure, what is Johnny I've it or not?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.240]   I just put something in the chat on the rundown.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.800]   Have you seen the Johnny I've like it?
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.320]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.800]   So it's all beautiful ones going to be made, right?
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.680]   And so I don't...
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.880]   It's like Senator, you're no Senator moment.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   Huh?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.840]   Well, what was the famous debate line?
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.800]   I knew Jack Kennedy.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   You are no Jack Kennedy.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   Who was it?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   God.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   We're too old.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   Yeah, we are.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.040]   It was in a presidential debate or actually was a vice presidential debate.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   Vice presidential debate.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   Yes.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.120]   And anyway, it doesn't matter now.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.000]   Was it Dan Quail and Lloyd Benson?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   How about God?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Are you cheated, didn't you?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.800]   Yeah, I had a little help.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.360]   Lloyd Benson saying, "I knew Jack Kennedy.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.120]   I worked with Jack Kennedy and you, sir, are no Jack Kennedy."
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120]   And he was right.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.400]   Jack Kennedy could smell tomato.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.240]   So Johnny Ive has designed this beautiful like a camera.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   There's only going to be one.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.320]   It's going to be auctioned by Sotheby's on November 23rd to benefit product red.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.520]   Banos charity to fight AIDS in Africa.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.760]   They expect it to go off at half a million to three quarters of a million dollars for
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.760]   this one camera.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   Jesus.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   It is beautiful.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760]   It is beautiful.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   But...
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   So Johnny is brilliant.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.960]   There's no question Johnny is brilliant.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   I don't know.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.560]   Without Johnny is a whipcracker.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   Can he inspire?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.560]   Well, is he a business?
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   Maybe.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.000]   Does he have the business genius?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Well, I think Tim Cook does.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Yeah, Cook does.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.120]   Cook has the business genius, yeah.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.080]   But the point is, and I keep coming back to this, it's the innovators dilemma.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.040]   It's very hard to be a successful tech company and continue on.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.280]   Microsoft couldn't do it.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.960]   IBM couldn't do it.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.400]   It's going to happen to Apple at Google at some point.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   So far Google has.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.600]   Yeah, but Google's what?
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   13 years old.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.600]   15.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   15.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   He said their birthday didn't they?
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.000]   It's not an old company.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.200]   It was a search company.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   It was an ad company.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   It's an all mobile company.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.760]   It's so far it's had three lives.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.160]   So maybe the Larry Page strategy of letting a million flowers bloom is the right way to
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   do it.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   I don't know.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   Well, he doesn't want a million.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.360]   He lets a million bloom and then he stomps on 900,000.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.960]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   Which is a strategy.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   Okay, let's talk about this.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   Actually, I want to take a break.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.280]   Then I want to talk about Chromecast because there's some stomping going on.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.000]   Yeah, it's stomping time.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.680]   And we're also going to get our change log because I've been gone a long time.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.840]   I don't know what you have to tell me everything that Google's done in the last three weeks.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   Okay.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.080]   We'll play back the last three.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.800]   Knowing Google, they've done a million things.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.240]   We got a brand new sponsor I want to talk about.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   Full sale university.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   Do you know?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   Do you know full sale?
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.720]   I think you do, Jeff.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   I do.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.400]   It's a competitor, but a worthy competitor.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.800]   It's a for-profit university that does a lot of really good practical stuff like in my
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.520]   field of journalism and media and offers degrees.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.920]   And as someone who put it in the chat room before the show, JD Harmeyer of the Howard
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.840]   Stern Show is a proud graduate of Full sale.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   There you go.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   That's worth.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   So they have a campus.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.200]   I think that's the Florida campus, but they also have an online campus.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.360]   You can get master's degrees.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   You can get bachelor's degrees.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.040]   They have an online internet marketing master's degree program.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.600]   So if you want to keep pace with marketing technologies, I mean, like the latest stuff,
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:25:00.120]   like social media, search engine optimization, web metrics, stuff that frankly, a conventional
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.640]   university isn't going to be up on.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.320]   Full sale can teach you.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.200]   Analyzing online consumer behavior, you will be working on real projects with real clients
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.320]   to gain experience, to generate results, and to learn from people, instructors who really
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.560]   are in the industry and have the real experience.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.560]   And I love this.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.240]   This really is kind of the new kind of university, frankly.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:28.100]   Full sales online and campus degree programs are centered on real world education, experience
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.960]   with industry technology and workflow.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.880]   You can earn your master's degree in a year, 12 months.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.480]   They also have something called Project Launchbox.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.520]   Students receive a MacBook Pro preloaded with Apple's creative software tools, the whole
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.840]   thing, as well as degree specific sets of pro level applications.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:50.400]   They have classes in all video production, audio production.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.160]   They've Grammy award winners, Emmy award winners.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.400]   They've got an MFA in film production, a mobile gaming master's program.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.600]   How about that?
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:07.560]   If you wanted to say, what's the thing I could do that would guarantee me the best shot at
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   making a million bucks in technology, learn how to do mobile gaming?
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.080]   That would be the way to do it.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   So here's the deal.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.600]   I want you to visit fullsale.edu/twig.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.120]   We've got a special landing page.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.880]   I really wanted you to know about full sale.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.160]   I think it's a very interesting program.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.200]   I know a number of people have got.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.680]   In fact, I've talked to Lisa.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.920]   Lisa really wants to go and get her advanced degree.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.160]   And I said, "Look, we'll pay for it.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   We'll pay for you, our CEO."
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   And I think this is a great way to have somebody who's still working, who's still part of the
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.200]   company, but enhance their skills to bring to the company.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:54.040]   Real world experience in entertainment, media, and technology, full sale, F-U-L-L-S-A-I-L,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.840]   like a boat.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.400]   Although they have an airplane as a logo, so I don't know what that means.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.320]   Full sale, university, fullsale.edu/twig.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   We're in a new sponsor.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.000]   We want to welcome them.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.880]   And I really encourage you to just go and check it out.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.720]   This is one way to keep education relevant.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.680]   Really is interesting.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   And I think education needs for profit competitors.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.320]   It needs to be in education or big fat, sassy, lazy, and stuck in our own way.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.640]   Hey, well, if it doesn't work, if they don't make it, they're out of business, right?
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   They got it before.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   They got it before.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.880]   If you give students what they need to get jobs in the world.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.440]   What's Lisa want to study?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.880]   Well, she's already got a business to grab.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:53.000]   But I think this is really true, and I know most companies do this, when you have somebody
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.040]   who's a really valuable part of the company, having them get additional education while
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.800]   they're working is phenomenal.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   She's willing to take the time in her downtime to do that, if only more companies would.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.360]   We should pay for that.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.760]   I think that only benefits us.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.480]   Full sale, they even have Academy Awards 35 graduates worked on seven different Oscar-winning
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.960]   films from full sale.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.320]   That is pretty impressive.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.480]   All right, moving on.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   Let's do it.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   Let's play the drums.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.200]   Before we do, we should give a plug.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.800]   The guy who did the changelog frame is up to something new, right?
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.680]   Yeah, so that's Jesse Wiener.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:41.280]   He worked on a YouTube video, and he did the score for it.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:52.920]   If you head on over to bit.ly/boats2013, you can see the video that he worked on, or bit.ly/salesong.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.560]   Let me skip the ad here.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.560]   Hold on.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.360]   Yeah, /sale on songs.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.920]   So this is like cars and planes?
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.280]   Yeah, but with boats.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.760]   So basically, and there's some really famous YouTubers in there, and what's going on is
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.640]   there's a pitch for the new movie, which is boats.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.440]   And he did the music.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.840]   Nice job, Jesse.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   They're boats that talk.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.920]   Nira Dorable.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.560]   Is she a famous YouTuber?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.560]   No, we don't have a story yet.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   I bet you that.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.560]   That guy's not.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.400]   He's like, you look like me.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.200]   Let's keep Jumbo over there.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   Who's cool?
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   Okay, let's go on.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.520]   Who will start causing problems in just a bit.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.280]   But yeah, yeah, so he worked on that.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   Cool.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   The dot ElY/boats2013.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   Check it out.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.000]   B-I-T dot ElY/boats2013.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.080]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, another Jesse Wiener production, the Google change log.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.880]   I want to be in the water.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   Turn me off.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   The Google change log.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.280]   Gene and Trippani will now catch me up on everything that's happened since I've been
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   gone.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.120]   Well, at least everything that's happened since last week.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   All right.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.000]   Google search results, just in time for premiere season, Google search results now tell you
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.320]   when a TV show is airing.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.360]   So if you do a Google search for, say, the Goodwife TV show, which I highly recommend,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.040]   great show, just did a great episode about NSA surveillance.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   Yes.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.920]   Steve was talking about that.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.760]   Yeah, it was, you know, it's TV.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.000]   So there are parts that are fictionalized and a little eye-roly.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.680]   But for the most part, for a CBS show on Sunday night, they do a really good job.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.360]   A lot of issues that we talk about here on Twig, too.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.040]   So you Google a TV show name, like the Goodwife or Modern Family or Agents of Shield.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.080]   If it's a show that has a really common term, like I'm hooked on parenthood.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.560]   If you just Google parenthood and you just add TV show to the end of it, in the knowledge
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   graph area there on the right side, you'll get all the episodes that are coming up and
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.080]   their air dates and some things about the cast.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.840]   And if there's a new episode that's going to come up, yeah, that's the thing.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.640]   Remind me, Uncle Google now.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.760]   So Google now remind you about new episodes on your phone or tablet.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.360]   This also works for movies.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.000]   So I can't wait for the next Hunger Games movie to come out.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.880]   It's in November, counting down the days.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.960]   You can add just a little reminder to Google now and it'll tell me when the movie will
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   be out.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.680]   So really cool, really nice use of the other.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.720]   It's really cool to see that reminder link there for Google now that links to Android
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.720]   too.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.800]   I want to search for DEX's 5 and have it remind me.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   So let's be nice.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.560]   Remind me to buy an X's 5.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:38.160]   Yeah, we're going to talk about that.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.000]   So yeah, good stuff there and search results.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.400]   I love Google now.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.400]   Have we said that lately?
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   Yes, we have.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   Yeah, Google now is awesome.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   It's getting better.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.880]   When I was traveling, I used it all the time.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.080]   It would say things like, oh, the time at home is, or hey, you want to go to the Rialto
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   Bridge?
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.480]   It's five minutes by boat.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.760]   I mean, it was brilliant.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.680]   It's particularly good when you're traveling up when you're someplace other than home.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.880]   It'll tell you currency conversion and when you're going to be airport.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   Really, it's really great.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.600]   It even would say things like, so it's morning in Turkey and it knows I'm in Turkey.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.520]   It says, here's how you say good morning in Turkey on my Google now cards.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.520]   Wow.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   It's great.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520]   It's wild.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.520]   That's amazing.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.400]   You could just be at breakfast and be like, speak for me, Google now.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   Say good morning and.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   Oh, yeah, you could do that.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.360]   It didn't say Turkish out loud, but I could say to Google now, you know, tell the Condo
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.400]   Tieri that I'm just a visitor here and it would say it's an Italian.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   Nice.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.600]   Very nice.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   Very cool.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.480]   So what else is good new?
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.800]   Oh, little minor change that'll help.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.440]   Sharing Google Docs is now easier for people who use Google Apps through a domain, which
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   I do.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   You try to share a Google Doc with a client or someone who's outside of your domain, who
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.160]   doesn't have an address in your domain.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.040]   It'll say, oh, this person's on the outside.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.720]   And if they don't have a Google account, they can't share it.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.960]   You have to use a link that anybody can see.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.840]   Well, now you do not have to have a Google account in order to see.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.120]   This is actually big.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   It's a big deal.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.120]   It's a big deal.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.480]   So you can share a Google Doc with someone who does not have a Google account.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.960]   You can send them an email with a link and they can view the link without having to sign
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:22.480]   into Google to see the Doc, which sounds very minor, but it actually is really a big thing,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.000]   especially when you're sending Docs around to clients or potential customers or whatever.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.840]   Google Glass Update this week, XE10, new firmware, came with a couple of different updates.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.320]   The biggest one is Transit.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.960]   If you're in one of the cities that Google Maps has trans data for, Google On Glass, it
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.320]   will show you not only time tables, but guidance on where to change trains, the distance to
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.360]   the nearest bus stop, overall estimated time of arrival.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.880]   And other minor changes in XE10 for Glass, you can see links and notifications, you can
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.160]   open up a site.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.840]   If you get a link and a notification, you can see profile pictures in a background or a
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.400]   message or a comment card.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.320]   Google's really pushing, you know, been pretty, pretty great about pushing out updates to
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   Glass.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   So nice, nice.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.880]   You know how often do you wear yours?
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.840]   Not very often.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.920]   Not very often, but I have to tell you, transit in directions in an urban area.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.000]   Like when I go back to New York, walking around the streets of New York, Glass, you know,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.960]   much like now is very helpful when you're traveling.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.520]   Like I feel like Glass in, you know, the streets of New York, the streets of San Francisco
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   would be extremely, extremely helpful.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.720]   Right now, I really, no, right, not in the subway, right, because you're not connected.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.360]   Although some subway stations are actually getting connectivity.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.840]   Last time I was in New York, I was on a train on the tracks and there was a guy talking
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.440]   in the cell phone and I was like, how is this happening?
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.760]   And it must have been one of those stations where like, I guess there was AT&T service
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.960]   and he was saying to the guy, I don't know how I have service down here.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.040]   So I don't know how they're doing that, Jeff, if they're just hooking up in certain stations
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   or what?
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   Yes, they are.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.520]   I know there's Wi-Fi in certain stations.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.000]   I didn't realize that there was.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.280]   And the cell service being the alone 42nd street.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.280]   Okay.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   Okay.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.600]   So, so I don't use, I don't wear Glass a whole lot.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.680]   I wear it on weekends when I'm out and about.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.400]   And I do wear it when I'm playing with the baby and the baby's just starting to learn
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   how to walk now.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   So that's been really fun.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   Really?
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   I could help her.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   Boy.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.840]   I could help her and hold both her hands and still get footage of that, which is really
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   nice.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.760]   So it still does remain like the baby dogs, puppies and kittens.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.240]   But you're really, you're seeing, I mean, as we talked about the value of Google Now,
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.000]   you're seeing that what really Google Now needs is a delivery mechanism that's kind of
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   always on.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Yes.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.800]   It's a pain right now to have to, not a big pain, but it's a pain to have to look, oh,
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   let me see the card.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.320]   Wouldn't it be great if it popped up, you go into a restaurant and it says, hey, here's
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:44.280]   how you say, I want bacon and eggs in Turkish on your, some sort of display.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   That's cool.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.240]   Or your wrist, you know, wrist or.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's challenging.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.800]   I don't know how you do it.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   Glass is annoying.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.200]   I mean, there's no perfect solution yet.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   It's, I think it's great.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   I think the brain tap.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.960]   If you can see the Google's Google Now is clearly the software component of this just
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   in time.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.240]   We know what you want and what you need right now delivery mechanism.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.520]   They just have to get the hardware side down, but the software side, they're doing a great
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520]   job now.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   It's getting better and better and better.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.600]   Somebody in the chat room said, I want Google then so I can figure out where I put my keys.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.160]   But it could do that, right?
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.280]   I mean, theory, it knows more and more about you.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.520]   It's kind of spooky.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   It's really good.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   It's true.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.720]   What else we got?
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:36.440]   Oh, Google, just a few days after shipping Chrome of 30, Google debuted Chrome 31 beta
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.400]   with a few new features.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.520]   First is web payments.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.640]   So web developers will get access, programmatic access to the browsers, auto complete information.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.160]   So when you save your credit card information or your Google wallet account, so developers
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:56.240]   can use a new function that can say, hey, use this payment information in order to go
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   through this payment flow for the apps with users permission, of course.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.640]   There's new portable native code, which gives developers the ability, executive executive,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:12.200]   execute native code in the browser, so compiled C++ code, all that means super, super fast.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.880]   And application shortcuts for Android.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.720]   So developers can make their websites able to put a shortcut to your desktop or your Android
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:27.280]   home screen to your web app, which can act like a native app as well.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:31.160]   It can get rid of the Chrome and the tabs and just show a special full screen mode.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.240]   It's kind of cool.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.560]   And that's all kind of developer stuff in the new Chrome and that's Chrome 31 beta for desktop
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.040]   and Android.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.320]   And finally, HBO shows, the oatmeal is going to be happy to hear this.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.520]   HBO shows are now available on Google Play.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.240]   So Game of Thrones, the newsroom, True Blood, or what's the case?
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.040]   The wire, the wire, the wire, those all available.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.760]   Episode pricing varies from 199 to 299.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.240]   So here's my favorite part of that.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.120]   My favorite part is that the newsroom is cheaper than the others because it deserves to
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   be chunky.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.080]   You get what you pay for?
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.480]   Everybody who actually works in news hates the newsroom.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.280]   I hated it too.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.880]   I don't know why.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.120]   I watched the first episode of this last season.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   I literally couldn't watch anymore.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.120]   I watch the movies.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.280]   It sounds like you like this.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.760]   It was a totally guilty pleasure of mine.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.520]   I watched every episode just so that I could hate on it, just so I could be like, I mean,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.440]   you know, the female characters are terrible.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.800]   The dialogue is ridiculous and overblown.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   Like, it was great.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.040]   There were so many things about it that were just ridiculous, but it was like watching
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   a circus.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.880]   I was like, okay, you know, you know, watching it last season, but I went on Twitter to complain.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.120]   Half people would say, yeah, funny, funny, funny, funny.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   People say, where are you complaining?
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   They don't watch anything.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   This season, I get zero reaction.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   No newsroom tweets.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   Nobody's watching.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   No one's really watching.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.680]   Yeah, not as many people watching it.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.320]   I wouldn't be surprised if it's not around much longer.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.880]   No, I think it got renewed.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.640]   I think this, I think HBO said we're going to do another season.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.640]   Why?
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.920]   This is what happens when you don't have Homeland.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   Homeland's back.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   Homeland.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.320]   I haven't watched it.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.160]   And don't tell me about Breaking Bad.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   Oh, I was on a boat with you right now.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   Don't.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.440]   I have not breaking bad at all.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   At all.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.440]   Yeah, at all.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.440]   Oh, guess what?
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   It's on Google Play.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.440]   It is.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.440]   I thought that's how I watched it.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   Me too.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   You know what?
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.680]   Every single episode of Breaking Bad, I watched on Google Play.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.480]   I binge watched to get caught up.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:40.080]   I actually, I didn't like having to lose this savoring that I had on planes.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:45.120]   The only episode I watched on air was the final episode and the commercials drove me nuts.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.760]   It completely cut up the tense mood of the show.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.120]   I can no longer watch TV with commercials.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.520]   God, it was such a difference.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.320]   So I, even though I could have watched it for free, I could even have watched it on demand
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   for free.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.920]   I paid for it on play.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.160]   And the reason I used play, and we're going to talk about this later, is because I can
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.360]   Chromecast it.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.480]   And I can watch it on plane.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   So I can watch it anywhere.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   I can watch it.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   Highly recommended.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   Do it.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   Start the beginning.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.680]   It's been on my to-do list.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.800]   Well, because, you know, I actually did start to watch it back when I first started airing.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.280]   I think I made it through like the hat.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.080]   I was the whole past season.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.640]   But then it got bad and I lost interest.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.440]   But then apparently it got really good again.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.720]   And then the finale, I guess, was really worth it.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.360]   So now that I know that the finale is worth it, I'm willing to go back and rewatch.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.440]   I don't want to be a lost or a soprano situation.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.840]   I like a satisfying finale.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.240]   You should save it.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.720]   I save shows for the old age home.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.160]   Because you don't want to get there and you got nothing to do and there's nothing to
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.640]   watch because you've seen it all.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.600]   So save a few things.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   You know, we don't watch TV with the baby with the baby in the room.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.080]   So basically I can only watch TV like after she's gone.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   Is this a philosophical thing?
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.400]   Our pediatrician talked us about it.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   It's an APA thing.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.240]   They actually recommend that kids don't or that you discourage media use.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.360]   Not that they don't watch TV, but they really discourage sort of screen time before age
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   two.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   And what is the thinking?
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.960]   Well, there have been links, you know, so they don't grow up to be asked.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.440]   Yeah, there's links to obesity and ADHD and other sort of attention issues and they're,
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:22.640]   you know, they're their brains are developing at a very rapid rate in the first two years,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.520]   more rapidly than any other time in their life.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.720]   And honestly, the TV is not in the room.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.800]   The baby just cranes her head and stares at it.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   So we try on.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.040]   Yeah, it's filling their brain faster than any real experience possibly could.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   It's good for them.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.240]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   It's right.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.160]   It's it's like the thing.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.480]   Remember in the in the fifth element where she where she was the alien and she had to
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.640]   learn everything about civilization.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   What did she do?
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.940]   She watched TV.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.040]   She watched it fast forward and was able in three days to learn to speak English and
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.920]   know exactly everything about culture.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.840]   You're depriving your child of a fundamental educational opportunity.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.840]   I went when she's two, we will start with the fundamental education.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.640]   I didn't let my kids watch TV either and look what happened.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   Okay.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.120]   I watch TV and look like turn into a TV reviewer.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:14.920]   I don't you know, I would watch Breaking Bad with Edda in the room.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   Exactly.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   Well, there's that too.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   The stuff that we love me.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.720]   I want some of that blue meth.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.600]   How do I get that?
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   Not age appropriate.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   Not age appropriate.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:31.040]   You know, she's going to get back at you because you're going to get Barney to death.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.840]   I'm not looking forward to that.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.200]   I'm not looking forward to opening up the baby Einstein DVD is like I'm just like, you
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   know, sesame Street.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.880]   I am looking forward to Pixar movies very much looking forward to.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.280]   No, it's not it's not in your control, Gina.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.840]   I would hate to experiment with my child's mushy little brain in any way.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.920]   So I understand that.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.360]   But at the same time, I don't think there's real science behind any of this.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.280]   I think it's somebody's good idea.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.520]   Like, you know, it's probably not good for them to watch TV.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.800]   I don't think there's any science who's going to test one year olds.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.280]   Let's take a control group and and let them watch TV all they want and another group and
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   let them not want.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.480]   And let's see how they turn out in 20.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   Nobody's done that.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.480]   Right.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   Right.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   You're probably absolutely right.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   It's not an absolute at all.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.080]   And it's just somebody's good idea.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.320]   But I'm not recommending experimenting with your children either.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.840]   You should just do what your cut says.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.680]   I mean, she at this point, we just wanted to spend time picking up things and getting,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.480]   you know, building her fine motor skills and working on, you know, crawling and walking
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.680]   rather than kind of sitting back.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.440]   She would just be mesmerized by the screen.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.200]   I think it's moral panic.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   More moral panic.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   I think it is.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.800]   And I guess this is the thing that strikes me wacky.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.840]   My good friend at the time, Peter Travers, who's now Rolling Stone, we were people together
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.880]   and he had a wonderful son named Alex.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.240]   And it was when no gigantic video cameras were out.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.360]   And I thought, wow, this is really going to skew this kid's brain because he sees himself
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   on the TV set.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360]   Right.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   Right.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.360]   No, it doesn't.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.360]   It's his video.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   What's the video?
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   Video.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.360]   Video.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   Right.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.760]   Humans have an amazing ability to adapt to whatever crap is fed to them.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.800]   Does that see yourself on TV?
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.280]   I mean, the one thing I do do is I play videos of her that I've taken of her, like, on my
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   phone.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.280]   So she loves my phone.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   She like looks, you know, like, Gina, you've flown it already.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.120]   We, you know, we have to be video, video conference with grandma.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.640]   It's your time to meet.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.880]   She also loves looking in the mirror.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.520]   I mean, that's the thing that babies do.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.080]   They don't, they don't realize that it's like another, another kid there.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.120]   You know, they don't realize themselves right away.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.520]   So she kind of, she, you know, laughs at herself in the mirror.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.920]   She likes to watch videos of herself on my phone.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.960]   And we do tell, we do video conference with grandma a few times a week.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.520]   So she's not like she's not in front of a screen.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.880]   Just we just try to keep the TV.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.720]   So she's going to think the TV is nothing but, but grandma's.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   Grandma's a her.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   It's true.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.960]   Why is the TV not talking back to me and saying it loves me?
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.440]   Why am I not on TV?
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   Right.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.840]   She's going to want to know why grandma is a singing star.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.040]   Constantly and reacting to her.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   It's true.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   Well, that's all I got.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:15.760]   And that my friends is the Google exchange log.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:22.200]   When are you going to give Edda a smartphone?
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.960]   Oh, man, that's a really good question.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.040]   We're thankfully pretty far out from that.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040]   It's five years out at least.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.720]   She's already kind of fixated on my phone because I, because it's constantly in my hands
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.080]   and I'm constantly looking at it.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.040]   So she wants to know kind of what's, and then she tries to put it in her mouth.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   So I don't know.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.040]   We're going to see.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.480]   I like to think that it's going to be later on, but I think it's probably going to be
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   earlier.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:53.880]   That was in Europe in Europe because of the, of the, of the, the tariffs being different
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.720]   for phone service that you can, it costs nothing to receive calls.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.360]   I knew tons of Europeans who early on gave their five year olds phones.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   Why not?
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Tons.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   Why not?
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   You can reach them.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.840]   If they get lost, they can call home.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.600]   But then schools in the US forbid it.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.640]   They can generate bitcoins for their college education.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.800]   It's a useful thing.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.760]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   Let's take a break.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   When, thank you for the change log.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   I feel up to date now.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.760]   Thank you.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:31.520]   We're going to talk about Chrome cast and, and, and coosh, coosh, coosh, how do you say
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   it's coach, coach?
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.160]   There's a you, but the you is silent.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   Yep.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.240]   But first a word from Shutterstock.com.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:50.160]   If you are creating content as I do, if you have a blog or you have a website or you have,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:58.360]   you do PowerPoint presentations, you got to check out Shutterstock.com, the best source
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.080]   for royalty free images.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   They've got, let me just check.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.760]   I always like to check at the bottom.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.400]   They're about to turn the clock over.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.520]   They're almost up to 30 million royalty free.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.360]   By the time you hear this, because they're adding, look it, they just added 180,000 new
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.040]   stock images this week.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.120]   So if my calculations are correct within the next couple of days, they're going to
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:27.120]   cross 30 million royalty free stock images with a, and now you might say, well, that's
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.280]   too many, but they've got the best search ever.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.440]   Fabulous search tool that lets you search not only for a thing, but also for adjectives.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   You could search for a hippo or a cranky hippo.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.040]   You could search for a blue hippo.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.520]   Really a great way to kind of collect images, to get some inspiration, to illustrate.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.680]   They also have video.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.560]   If you click the footage tab at the top of Shutterstock.com, you'll see their great video
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.120]   footage.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.400]   Really high quality stuff.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.480]   You can see I have a subscription, which I really like.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:08.520]   I get 25 images a day, which is very useful for creating content.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.960]   We use it for the whole company.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   So here's the deal.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.200]   I want you to check it out.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.600]   It's free to create an account, and that's the first thing you should do.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.880]   Just go create, you don't need to give them a credit card or anything.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   Just go create an account, because then you can start using the light boxes to save images
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.400]   and ideas.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.560]   Use it for inspiration.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.160]   Share it with the colleagues.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.480]   They've got a great iPad app.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.680]   If you have an iPad or an iPhone, check that out.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:35.640]   Shutterstock.com, they're truly international as we are.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.720]   They have more than a dozen countries, full-time customer support throughout the week, multilingual
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.240]   customer support, and all of those images.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.320]   The cats alone make it worth it.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.320]   We have so much fun.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.080]   I don't know if you've seen on the social hour, what they do.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.040]   Brian does with the cats.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.960]   And Sarah, because Sarah has a little fetish for the feline, a feline fetish.

[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.880]   So I've been very excited about the Chromecast.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.960]   We were just talking about the fact that Jeff and I both buy content on Google Play.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:37.520]   One of the reasons I do is because I have Chromecast all over so I can go, I can start
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:43.120]   a show on my phone, on Netflix on my phone, or on Google Play, send it to the Chromecast.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.520]   I can visit somebody's house.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.600]   It doesn't have to be my Chromecast and send the video to there.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.560]   The quality is great.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.040]   I really like it.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:59.880]   But it's still Netflix, Hulu, I guess is the recent edition, right?
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   And Google stuff.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.360]   And that's all.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.720]   And now it's starting to turn out that maybe Google is slow playing this.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.960]   What's going on?
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:14.200]   Apparently, a lot of companies want to support Chromecast, but Google is not saying, "Go
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.320]   ahead and do it."
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   That's weird.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.320]   Why?
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:26.160]   Now, so the article that I saw implied that Google is trying to kiss up to the big media
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.240]   companies.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.640]   This would not be the first time Google has done such a thing.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:37.360]   They certainly do that with YouTube, but that they're not supporting, well, this is
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.080]   from Read, Write, Web.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.400]   What's holding up Chromecast apps?
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   Nothing.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.560]   But Google, Adriana Lee writing, she talks about Cosh.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:53.000]   Now Cosh, in fact, she even mentions, Cosh had lunch, went to have lunch with the engineers
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   there and came back and saying, "Even though they broke my app, the AllCast app, by updating
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.840]   the API, I don't blame them."
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.920]   Cosh said, "I really think they believe in having an open platform."
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:15.960]   But Google has to whitelist an app before it will work on Chromecast, and they haven't.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.920]   Blue Plus is the only one they've added.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.080]   Have you tried to do the Twitch stuff?
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   Wasn't that was an API?
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.080]   Well, it's not me.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.080]   Well, okay.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.400]   So this is the interesting thing.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.080]   It's a simple thing to add, apparently.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.920]   The code's not complicated.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.840]   We don't develop any of our Twitch stuff in-house, so I don't have anything to do with it.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.760]   But Houdini, seven Craig Malaney, who does one of our apps, says he was going to add
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.280]   it, but they've got to prove it.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   Oh, and they're not doing it.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   That's weird.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.800]   And there's just nothing coming out.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.680]   In this article, she speaks specifically with the folks at PlayOn.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.760]   They have an app called PlayCast.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.720]   They want to be able to stream a hidden web browser window on the computer over to a
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.080]   Chromecast-connected TV.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.760]   It's just like Chromecast's tab casting, basically.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:11.640]   They developed the app in a month and a half, and it's ready, but Google has not yet approved
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   it.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.240]   Which is an online backup at storage service.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.240]   This might be one.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.800]   I can understand maybe Google slow playing this one.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.960]   They want you to be able to store your videos on BitCasa and then play it directly back
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.520]   onto the Chromecast.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.680]   But Google has yet to say, yeah.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:37.280]   So I really hope that Google isn't just kind of kissing the butts of the big companies,
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:43.080]   like Clear Channel, like Pandora, like Revision 3, The Washington Post.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.400]   I hope that they are open and they want to.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.680]   Google says it wants to support all types of apps, including those for local content.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:59.240]   And apparently they've given a very solid API out in an SDK.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.160]   But there's something else going on here.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.520]   I just don't know.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.120]   I hope this is not one of those cases.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:12.680]   I hope this is not where Google gets in trouble is when it prioritizes a corporate deal over
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   the user.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.680]   Right.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.680]   Verizon.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.680]   Don't do that.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   Get me started.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.960]   In fact, you will get me started soon on Verizon.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.800]   All that time you were gone, Leo.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.800]   Nothing's happened.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   Nothing.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   But we'll get back to that.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   Nothing.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   We'll get back to that.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   Right.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   And so that in China, when they do corporate deals, when they try to suck up to the big
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.360]   guys, that's when they do the wrong thing.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.360]   I hope that's not the case.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:41.040]   I hope some other feature coming or something coming that's just going to make it better
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.200]   and they're holding off.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.880]   I still think the Chromecast is great.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.880]   I mean, it's $35.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.560]   It's not like I can really complain.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.840]   It's worth $35 just for what I saw in my best buy recently so that they're getting the
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   stock back.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.920]   But I really think that it could be so much better.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:54:00.480]   I mean, if all of the apps on my phone were Chromecast enabled, I'd be so happy.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   Right.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.480]   Do you use it, Gina?
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.480]   Do you have a Chromecast?
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   I love it.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.000]   I've been mostly watching Netflix on it, which doesn't, you know, I mean, you can watch Netflix.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I'm pretty much anything.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   But yeah, I love it.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   I was just at a family party.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.840]   We were Chromecasting my Flicker album of the baby up on the up of the TV.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840]   It's a great device.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.000]   You can even bring the Chromecast in your pocket, bring it and go set it up over there.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Or hotel.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Or a...
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.680]   Well, you have to be able to...
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.000]   Yeah, well, you use your own MyFire or something.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Well, that's the way to do it.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Bring a MyFire.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.920]   Chad, go to the three shot.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   What?
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.920]   Cats?
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   I just the second cat I've seen.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.920]   Oh, okay.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.080]   So this is something I learned.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   Hi, Kitty.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:49.960]   This is something I learned in Turkey and Greece.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.320]   Unlike here in the US where they round up feral cats and they...
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.360]   I don't know what they put them away.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.720]   It's apparently just there's cats everywhere in Turkey and Greece.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.960]   So I've decided to increase the cat population of the Brickast Studios.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.880]   What does your dog think about this?
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.880]   Oh, he doesn't know.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   He thinks he's a cat.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.880]   He's only...
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   He's the same size.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.160]   Look, they look like there were little animations going by.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160]   No.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.160]   Yes.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.160]   Oh, there's the other one.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.160]   There's the other one.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   There's the other one.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   There's about 12 of them.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   I know your analysis.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   That was a trick.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.160]   How did you do that?
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.760]   He walked right into the TV set.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   Yeah, okay.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.760]   So what's going on?
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.760]   I don't know.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.760]   It's just a cat.
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.760]   He's itching.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.760]   Is this like some game?
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   Is this Chad?
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.760]   See you again.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   I thought it was...
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   It's Shutterstock.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760]   It's Shutterstock.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   It's Shutterstock.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   It's Shutterstock.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   It's Shutterstock.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   It's Shutterstock.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:59.120]   So some of the Shutterstock stock footages has out as a alpha channel so that we can keep
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.120]   it in on the...
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.120]   And we can put it anywhere.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.400]   You can put a cat right here on my desk if you wanted to.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   That's brilliant.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:09.120]   So see that black is keyable.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.080]   So we could put that cat anywhere.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.800]   Good work, Chad.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.760]   Chad has figured out the magic.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.440]   And of course Chad would do cats, wouldn't he?
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   Yeah, he would.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.600]   But it is interesting.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.600]   That is something I noted that all the ruins have cats everywhere.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:27.760]   Lots of cats.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.280]   And you can't pet them because they're feral.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   You don't want to...
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   They're not kitty cats.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.280]   I mess with them.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280]   You don't mess with them.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   There are no rats, however.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.280]   That's a good sign.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   That's a good point.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   That's a good point.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:45.240]   Actually, Lisa in our new house has decided that she's going to feed every feral cat who
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.800]   comes to the door.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   She wants to have...
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.720]   Because we have three acres, she wants to make sure there are no rodents.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.000]   I think you're going to find programmers show up too.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   We'll feed any programmer.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   So the...
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.640]   You mentioned the Google...
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.440]   Yeah, right.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.400]   You mentioned the Google Wallet and the Change Log.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.640]   As of right now, the Nexus 4 is right, the only phone.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.440]   And I can't get it to work on anything.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.840]   Oh, Google Wallet.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.560]   Lots of problem of carriers and greatest debt.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.560]   That's another Verizon.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.760]   So don't blame Google for that one.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   I think it's a carrier.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.760]   What's the point?
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.120]   Google Wallet is working on phones without NFC now.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.520]   It's even working on iOS, which doesn't have NFC.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.840]   I mean, you don't have the tap to pay.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.840]   You can send money.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   No, you can't even...
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   Okay.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   Let me look.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.840]   So I'm going to search for Google Wallet.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.760]   I think it works on T-Mobile and on open phones, but I don't think it necessarily works on like
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.800]   Verizon phones and AT&T phones.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.040]   I think that's only because people were ranting about it in my Verizon rants.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.240]   What's going on with that website?
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   Is this it?
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   Oh, here's wallet.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240]   Here's wallet.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.320]   So this is a nice thing about Play.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.280]   The Play Store is I can see immediately which phones I can install.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.800]   What is going on with my computer?
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:06.120]   Are you doing something, Chad?
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.080]   I swear I'm not.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:12.360]   This may be something that happened when you were gone, Leo, but they removed the support
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.360]   for NFC.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.800]   So you can use Wallet without NFC.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.960]   So now it will install on my other phones?
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   Yes.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   Yes.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   But all my phones had NFC all along.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   That's not it.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.720]   And so with that, they removed a lot of the carriers that didn't like it because like
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:30.480]   Verizon has their own payment system that they don't want to put on.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.800]   And so it didn't actually want to.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   They didn't want.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   Verizon didn't want Google Wallet to actually play it correctly.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   Okay.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   So I can't install it on a one.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   Do you don't have it on your one, do you?
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   I do.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.800]   I just installed it on my wallet.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:40.800]   Oh, they must have changed something.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.800]   Or update it.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   Is your one on Verizon?
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.880]   So Chad, are you saying it will now work on Verizon phones because it doesn't have to
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.880]   go to NFC?
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.160]   I'm actually not 100% sure if this will work on all carriers.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.960]   But I know that because of the NFC, take, you know, they've removed that.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   No.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   That it's now on almost any phone.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.960]   I can almost install my Moto X.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.440]   I couldn't do it before.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.440]   So this is good.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.000]   Because you can send money, you can store loyalty card information.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.400]   You can't do the tap to pay.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.400]   Yes.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   But I don't care about that.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.640]   I wasn't able to use it at all.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.480]   I wasn't installing a lot of my phones.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   So they've changed that.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   They have.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   They've changed that.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   That's fairly recent.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.400]   I think that's why I was just since I've been gone.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.040]   I just installed on the Moto X.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   That's awesome.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   Okay.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.840]   There's another story that the moving staff over to wallet that they're going to try to
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   make some push into wallets.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.480]   Well, that's why I bring it up.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:32.160]   Amazon has also started a pay with Amazon feature going out.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.160]   So there's a war.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   A born year.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.320]   There is a war going on.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:40.880]   You know, I've just been doing some development on something I'll have more information about
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.040]   soon, not today.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.280]   But I've been doing some, you know, I was in a position where I had to choose a payment
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.560]   vendor for a thing.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.920]   And you know, I looked at, you know, we looked at Stripe and we looked at Amazon payments
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.760]   and looked at Google Wallet and we looked at PayPal.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.240]   And we actually wanted to go going with Amazon, Amazon payments.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240]   Oh, really?
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.120]   Partially because it sort of fulfilled that we had sort of special requirements.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:08.160]   But yeah, I mean, there's, you know, it's not that, and it's not that easy for development.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.080]   Like there's a lot that could be done still.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.240]   Like these systems could be a lot easier to implement.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.480]   Stripe is really great.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.040]   I just didn't like with Stripe, you know, you have to enter your credit card like on the
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.760]   spot and I like the idea of signing into a trusted vendor.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   I don't know.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.240]   Not a big fan of PayPal.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.800]   So you know, Amazon is like a lot of people, you know, our, our intended audience have
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   Amazon accounts.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   They've saved their credit cards.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.480]   You know, you can do that kind of instant pay here.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.160]   You don't have to get up from your machine and find your credit card or, you know, if
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.360]   you save your credit card details.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.360]   So that made sense for us.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.040]   But I think there's a lot here that Google could do.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.200]   This is huge. This is all new and different since I've been gone.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.400]   This has all happened.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.640]   So I was not able to install it before I am able to install it.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.920]   I can add credit cards to it.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.120]   I can, as you say, send money, save offers and loyalty programs.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.720]   It's got all my recent transactions on here.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   This is great.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.200]   So yeah, finally, I've been waiting for wallet to take off.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.240]   So I can send you money directly.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.440]   Now the problem with wallet for my perspective as a developer, I just don't think a lot of
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   people have wallet accounts.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   Not as many people have wallet accounts as have Amazon accounts or have iTunes accounts.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.960]   So as a developer, you want to choose the most friction-free path for getting money, right?
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.520]   So you're still Google's not there yet.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.800]   But this is a good start.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.280]   I mean, right now, when do you create your wallet account?
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.400]   When you want to purchase something from the Play Store, Google's getting better with
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400]   that.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.040]   People are more people approaching apps and media.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.800]   But you don't think Google, when you want to send somebody money, when I want to send
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.720]   somebody money, I think, well, Chase supports that now, which is one of my banks.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.000]   PayPal, even though PayPal makes me feel kind of icky, it actually does work.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.880]   A lot of people have PayPal accounts, really thanks to eBay, right?
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.200]   But you still don't feel great about that.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.400]   There's still not a great, obvious, easy solution.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.880]   And so Google has to be in a position where a lot, everybody has a wallet account.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.640]   You have to, developers have to feel like, oh, everybody's got a wallet account.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   This is awesome.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.880]   Gina, how could Google, because Google has the market power to own something, what could
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.960]   they give that would make people all of a sudden sign up for wallet?
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.440]   Yeah, well, I mean, they tried those promotions where it was like, hey, you can get these
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.920]   movies for 10 cents.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.000]   All you have to do is create a wallet account and pay the 10 cents, right?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.440]   Like I think that the push, like little incremental promotional pushes like that.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.160]   I mean, what Google has to do is they have to sell something in the Play Store that's
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.760]   so compelling that everyone must have one.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.040]   The Chromecast is a good example.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.640]   And they have to create a wallet account in the process.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.720]   And I think just in general, Google's not the company that you go to for monetary transactions,
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   right?
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.960]   I mean, you go there for Gmail and you go there for search and maps, right?
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.040]   But I think part of it is just a perception issue.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.040]   I go to Amazon.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.560]   I've been buying stuff on Amazon for decades.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   I trust them.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.560]   Like they buy stuff in their--
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560]   Yeah, but--
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560]   It's a perception issue.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.320]   This is from a not me 613 in the chatroom makes a very good point.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   And I think that the investors are afraid of Amazon.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   They're not going to support Amazon payments because that's just giving Amazon.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   That's true.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.320]   That's why PayPal, PayPal, which is the friend of stores, is really making a push to get
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   into more and more stores.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   Google could be in that position.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320]   I don't know.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320]   Do people trust PayPal?
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:24.320]   I mean, the reputation PayPal has generated over the last few years has not been good.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   Not been good for nerds.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.320]   No, it's not.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   I think--
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.720]   Google's a big-- it's going to be a fascinating battle.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   And it's a marketing push.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.720]   I mean, get half off your Starbucks coffee.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   Somebody's going to do that.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.320]   Google is historically terrible at that though, aren't they?
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   Yes.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.320]   Well, they're not a marketer.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   They're terrible marketer.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   True.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320]   True.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   So I would rather use Wallet or maybe Apple Pass Book, on the problem with that is you have
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   to have an iPhone.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   Right.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.720]   I would rather use that than anything that you've just mentioned, including Amazon, although
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.720]   I do pay--
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.880]   Remember back to the day my friend, you, Peter Chardonnal, started a firefly out of MIT
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.320]   Media Lab, and it got bought because it had passport in it, which was Microsoft.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   Right.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   Microsoft way back when thought it could be this.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   Single sign off.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   Microsoft.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   Yeah, Microsoft couldn't do it.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.720]   All right, let's talk about the Nexus 5.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.920]   We've been putting it off, putting it off, putting it off.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.720]   What is there going to be in Nexus 5?
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:34.920]   Is it going to be, as some have said, this month in like a week, two weeks?
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.840]   You know, we don't know.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   We don't know for sure.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.840]   No, nothing.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   Nothing.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.680]   Yeah, I mean, the last rumor I heard about date was October 15th.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.920]   That's like this coming Monday.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   Right.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.240]   But the thing is, if they're going to ship this thing before the holidays, it's got to
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.440]   happen in the next couple of weeks, right?
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.360]   Because then you start to run into, you know, Thanksgiving and, you know, they got to have
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.560]   it out before the holidays.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.840]   So that was a couple of weeks ago in all that Android.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.040]   They were talking about October 14th and 15th.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.040]   Right.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.960]   Now, we have the iPad announcement that's supposed to happen like the 22nd.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.960]   We got to watch this.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.960]   We know that for sure.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   Yeah, we know that for sure.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.680]   Well, because all things D is pretty well connected, they say for sure, October 22nd,
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.240]   that will be, we don't know what it'll announce, but the suspicion is a new iPad, both the
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:19.000]   big version and the mini as well as a new Mac Pro.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.440]   We know that, you know, they're going to announce that.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.040]   But I, they've already done the iPhone.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.040]   I'd love to see a Nexus 5.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.840]   Yeah, next couple of weeks, I would say probably.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.200]   So what are the reports?
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.240]   One of the reports said that it was going to just like the Nexus 7 allegedly, we'll get
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:47.720]   that in a minute, is supposed to work on across CDMA and GSM.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   That's good.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.120]   That doesn't, that's the next big.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.840]   But for sure, the next big thing, because CDMA is moving to LTE.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.040]   And so all you have to do is support LTE.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   And that means everybody.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.640]   Well, the problem is though, you don't have the ratchet down to 3G if you don't have
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:05.840]   right coverage, right, but that's okay.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:13.080]   But Verizon still still still still still hasn't done Jacko and with government shutdown,
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.880]   there's no FCC to go after.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:20.080]   Do you mind Leo going down to, if I may do it, or actually, will that hold up to that
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   Nexus 5?
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.400]   Because the FCC can't do anything?
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   They can't approve anything.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:31.680]   You can't get, I've just had a new fellow arrive at my school and she can't open a bank
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.040]   account because she can't get a social security number.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.920]   All kinds of G.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.640]   So it would do me a favor if you would and go to the under other, there's another guy
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:49.720]   named Jarvis, no relation, Tim Jarvis went to, on Twitter, went to VZW support and said,
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.840]   if I may do a dramatic reading here.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.080]   Android 4.4 is coming by the end of October.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.800]   Will my Galaxy Nexus get 4.3 by then?
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.000]   Verizon responds, let's keep your phone running smooth.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.640]   I don't have any info.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.320]   Visit this address for updates.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   Are you having issues?
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.880]   Tim comes back and says, yes, I have an issue.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.880]   My Nexus software is out of date and needs an update to 4.3.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.200]   Verizon responds, like a pillow.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.440]   We are here to support you.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.520]   Are you able to make and receive calls?
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.880]   Is the internet/web working properly?
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.960]   This is not a human that he's talking about.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.520]   It's got to be a bot.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.900]   Tim Jarvis responds, yes, the phone works properly, however, it is a Nexus device and
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:34.320]   should have the latest version of Android, which it does not.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   Verizon responds, woohoo!
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.960]   Thanks for keeping us posted.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.440]   I'm glad to see that your device is working properly.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   You rock.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.760]   Oh my God.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.440]   To which Tim Jarvis finally says, woohoo.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.840]   You ignorant goose penis.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:56.440]   My Nexus is still in need of an update to 4.3 and soon will eat 4.4, but no, VZW sucks.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.960]   This is not the greatest.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.880]   I think goose penis might be my favorite new favorite put down.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.520]   Yeah, you goose penis.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   I don't even know goosees have that.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.400]   Well, how would they be gander?
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.400]   How would they be ganders?
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.920]   You know, not all animals have never mind.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   Well, that's true.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.800]   It sounds like the Howard Stern show.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.040]   Actually, it's a very interesting question.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040]   It is.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040]   Okay, Google now.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.600]   Oh boy.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:30.640]   What animals don't have penises?
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.120]   And this is the part where Twig turns into the Howard Stern show.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   Yes.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   You're welcome, Jada.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   You're right.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.560]   Seven animals with the weirdest genitalia on earth.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.040]   Okay, Google now.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.760]   You goose have penises.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   You can't do that.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.440]   You're on a nexus.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440]   Wow.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440]   What do you mean?
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.080]   Anyway, I just hit the button.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.320]   Oh, you had to hit a button.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320]   I see.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.320]   I didn't have to do anything.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   Oh, boy.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.480]   I'm going to be going to have to touch it.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.800]   By the way, I took the Moto X with me the whole time.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.440]   Excellent choice for traveling because it's light and small.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.280]   It was very effective.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.840]   Battery life was good.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.920]   It was a perfect phone for a traveling about Hither and Thither.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.680]   They did update it about a week ago with apparently a new camera firmware.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.680]   Among other things.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.640]   And I didn't notice much of an improvement.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.240]   I also have and if I'd had it, I would have brought up the new iPhone 5S because this
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.960]   camera I have to say is a great camera on the 5S.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.160]   iPhones have great cameras.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.160]   They always have.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.160]   How you like it?
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.160]   So what are you doing now?
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]   Are you double fisting?
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.400]   No, I don't know because then I also have.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   Oh, boy.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.120]   Oh, the Galaxy Note 3, which just came in with its.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.000]   You liked your Note 2 in the day.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   I had a Note 1 and a 2.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.400]   But you know, it's funny after using the Moto X, this thing feels so big.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   It's a gorgeous 3.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.600]   Well, so is the Nexus 5 going to?
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.320]   Well, I don't know how big is the Nexus 5?
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320]   Did they say 5 inches?
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320]   4.8, I think.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320]   4.8.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320]   That's not that big.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.840]   The HTC One is what?
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   4.7.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.360]   So, but this is a very high resolution screen.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.720]   It really is gorgeous.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.560]   Am I interested in Justin Donnelly's commute?
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.720]   I don't know why it's even asking me that.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   No.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.240]   Apparently, Justin Donnelly has now allowed me to look at his commute.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.280]   I don't, he's, I guess he's somebody I circled.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.240]   But you know, I think the screen is gorgeous.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.920]   It has this bizarre stitched, pleather bag.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.400]   It is weird.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.600]   And it also, and I'm not sure what the story is, it does not use micro USB.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.760]   It uses some odd connector.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.720]   So that's a big, this looks like USB 3.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.920]   It is USB 3, but you can still use micro USB with USB 3.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   Where do you plug it?
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   You just plug it in.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   Oh, I see, just plug it there.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.280]   Yeah, because one thing that I think is going to happen, the European Union is really getting
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.560]   serious about all phones have to have micro USB.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.680]   Oh, what's Apple going to do?
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.600]   Well, right now they ship an adapter.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.800]   I don't know.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.560]   I don't know.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:06.920]   Anyway, big, big iPhone 5S fingerprint reader works.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.960]   I don't know if that's enough to make it compelling it.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:18.520]   I have to say, going after using Android for so long, going back to configure a brand
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.320]   new iPhone just felt a little painful.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.800]   So I go, oh, I got to do that.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.840]   Now that's not Apple's fault.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.560]   Google stuff works best with Google, right?
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.720]   So you enter the Google account once, for instance, on an Android phone.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.320]   And every Google app now knows, you know, oh, that's you on an iPhone.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   You have to go.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.520]   I just want to do it because of my problem.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.240]   I keep buying things in play with the wrong account because I set it under one account
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   and not the other account.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.240]   They'll get me started.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.240]   Oh, that's confusing.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.840]   But you can have that problem on iOS as well.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.360]   I have different iCloud account.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   It's very interesting.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.000]   Yeah, for a while I was getting my son's photo stream.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.280]   That was enlightening from his freshman year in college.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   Not so bad.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:11.800]   I was more worried about him getting my photo stream, actually.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.280]   So what's your problem with Verizon?
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.800]   You have a note at what?
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800]   What is your problem?
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.640]   Oh, you dare forget.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.520]   I have my nice, wonderful Nexus 7.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.760]   And I announced in July, I've had it now for what?
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.760]   Five weeks.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.320]   And it's an LTE based.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   It's an LTE based.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.520]   Verizon still will not connect.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.800]   Yeah, because it's not there.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   They're allegedly open network.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.720]   They're supposedly certifying BS for Verizon.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.480]   There's no such thing on an open network.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480]   It's a lie.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.480]   I filed the complaint with the FCC.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480]   Verizon responded.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.040]   I filed back.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.880]   But now the FCC is out of business.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.480]   Yeah, that doesn't seem right.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.200]   I remember the story now.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.120]   As long as you're as long as you remember.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   I do.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120]   I do.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120]   And I want to get you started.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.520]   So let's do the-- we're going to do a new segment.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.720]   The Jeff Jarvis rant segment.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720]   You've got some things.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:15.560]   There's a bill, for instance, a foot in Israel that would require Google to pay 7% of its
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:20.200]   Israeli revenues to websites.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.880]   Miss Sugar.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:28.080]   So unfortunately, the full text is available for some-- it's behind a paywall, of course.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.520]   So I don't know what the rest of this--
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.120]   Don't make it close that and read it.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.120]   No, there's a paywall.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120]   The full text--
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.120]   Yeah, we'll check this up a little bit.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.120]   Oh, I got the weird.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.120]   I got it before.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.120]   Yeah, no, I have a paywall.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.200]   So since you read it, what websites?
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.200]   What websites?
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.160]   It's just content sites wanting to-- it's the same as the Germans and the French, which
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.040]   we'll get to in a second, and others just thinking, "Google has money and we don't."
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.320]   And that's not fair.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.920]   So they should give us some of our money.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.600]   Because Google wouldn't exist if they weren't free-riding on the back of these websites.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.760]   And they wouldn't exist on the internet without Google.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.720]   No, it's a mutually beneficial relationship.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.800]   You bet it is.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.880]   And then, if that's not enough to get your blood pressure up, Jeff, I'm trying to kill
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   them.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.840]   French Minister pushes Google tax to bridge Telco's funding shortfall.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.000]   Ned!
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.200]   This is my Google and then.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:28.000]   The top five US-based internet companies are stifling European innovation.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   Says a French Minister.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.680]   We're going to tax them like crazy to take money that's not going to actually cause
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   people to really compete and really innovate and really create things.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.080]   We're just going to give them a French dole.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.760]   Her name, I like it, the French Minister for the digital economy's name is Fleur-Pédaren.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.960]   Well, and also, she's the Minister for the digital economy.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   Digital economy.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.840]   She's a Finnish digital company.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:58.760]   She says Europe is being relegated to second league in the digital economy.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.000]   We are second league.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:11.960]   So they want to tax the largest US over-the-top internet providers, including Google.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.720]   For reasons why I didn't make no sense.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.160]   I don't think we ever did a follow-up on the, get the reggae ready.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   Leistung Schutzrecht.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160]   Is there more?
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:24.440]   Well, there was because what happened was it got instituted and then every single media
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.800]   company had to surrender and sign on for Google links.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   Right.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.040]   Because they weren't getting any traffic.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.840]   Well, I hope the Nexus 5 comes out because I don't have enough phones.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.120]   And I want to continue this too.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.120]   You need to know.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.920]   I'm not putting it on Verizon.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.920]   Verizon's not putting it on Verizon.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.680]   I don't, I think you're crazy to buy a locked phone of any kind.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.360]   You should, especially as you travel, you should buy an unlocked GSM phone and put a
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.000]   T-Mobile SIM in it.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.160]   T-Mobile, yeah.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.360]   And then when you get somewhere, buy a SIM there.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.240]   I don't know why anybody would buy a locked CDMA phone.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.000]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.960]   Did you read the, so Nick Bilton's book about Twitter is about to come out.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.880]   Boy, I can't wait to read this.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:19.920]   There's an excerpt in the New York Times talking about the founding of Twitter.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.640]   In a playground, the leader, but it was a playground, which is kind of nice.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:29.280]   But it also talks about the revisionist story of the founding of Twitter in which Jack
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:37.040]   Dorsey basically tries to completely eliminate the role of Noah Glass, who even in this book
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.760]   came up with the word Twitter, the name Twitter.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.200]   He was one of the founders of ODO, which was the parent company along with Evan Williams,
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.600]   that eventually came up with Twitter.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.240]   ODO was a podcast company.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.520]   And I just want to underscore this.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.920]   Twitter existed before ODO existed, long before Twitter existed.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.280]   We had a trademark on the name, Twitter.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.000]   Almost certainly Noah Glass, who's created a company that distributed podcasts, had heard
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.400]   of Twitter, which was the number one podcast at the time.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.800]   And yet he says, "I was looking through a dictionary for words."
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:16.880]   I have to thank Nick Bilton, because when he did it, Nick listed the T.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.600]   So apparently Noah had a dictionary going through, looking for names for Twitter.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.000]   Let's see if I can find this.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.080]   Oh, did Bilton mention Twit?
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.400]   Well, he didn't mention Twit exactly.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:38.240]   But he went through the list of T-words, and Twit was one of them, that they were considering.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.400]   I once asked Evan Williams, didn't you think that that might impinge?
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   Here it is.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.200]   Soon the question of a name came up.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:49.280]   Williams jokingly suggested calling the project "Friendstalker," which is rule that
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.760]   is too creepy.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.880]   Although it is one of the ways people use it.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.800]   Glass became obsessive, flipping through a physical dictionary, almost word by word,
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.000]   looking for the right name.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.360]   One late afternoon alone in his apartment, he reached over to his cell phone.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.280]   He turned it to silent, which caused it to vibrate.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.880]   He quickly considered the name "vibrate," which he nixed.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.120]   But it led him to the word "Twitch."
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.640]   He dismissed that too, but he continued through the T.W.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.840]   section of the direct dictionary.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.400]   Twist, Twit, Twitch, or Twit-gee.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.200]   And then there it was.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:25.640]   He read the definition aloud, "The light chirping sound made by certain birds.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.760]   This is it," he thought.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.560]   Agitation or excitement.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.560]   Flutter.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.560]   Twitter.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.000]   No, the URL was available.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.920]   Well, it didn't have any vowels originally, right?
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.080]   It was T.W.T.T.R.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   Yeah, it was.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.880]   It wasn't available, that's right.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.740]   Anyway, apparently Dorsey worked hard to get into Glass's name completely out of the
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:48.740]   founding legend.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.280]   How much stock did Glass have, I wonder?
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.760]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.400]   All these guys making a lot of money.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.000]   And has the lion's share.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.720]   Have will be a billionaire.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.840]   Actually, I respect, I don't know, and I'm maybe you guys do, but I'm sure you've spoken
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.840]   to him.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.800]   I never even have a couple of interviews.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800]   I know him.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.560]   What I like about it is when Odeo went under, he gave the investors money back.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.360]   Which I thought was pretty respectable.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.720]   I had amazing coverage.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.720]   Nick Denton came to me.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.640]   Nick Denton's the guy who showed me blogger, it's all his fault.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.680]   And I said, "What's the big deal?"
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.000]   And then when blogger was about to fool one of many times, he got me to get my bosses,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   the new houses to invest.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.640]   I saved it one of many times.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.320]   And I had amazing meetings with them at the time.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.800]   Some of the great meetings I love is watching some, I've watched, my stock are moving to
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   the same thing, where they kind of don't know how some of this business, strange business
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   stuff works.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.360]   They've got a great idea.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.160]   They don't know what's what, and they kind of scratch in their heads.
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.920]   And then you see them turn into amazing business people.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.080]   But yeah, I've kept this company, and it was very controversial because all the staff
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.440]   left and everything else, he kept the thing operating in his kitchen, but he believed
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.400]   in it, and he kept it alive.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.160]   And I respect the heck out of that.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.840]   And sold it to Google and started, stated Google as long as he had to, and then changed
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.440]   the world again with Twitter.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.040]   And then I can't wait to read Nick's book to see what the real story is of the various
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   backstabbing's there.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   Oh, it's a mess.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.040]   It's great.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.040]   It's a soap opera.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.960]   I think not just the founders and the executives, but also the board, I think is probably--
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   Yes.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:24.400]   They talk about the uncomfortable conversation where they moved upstairs.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400]   Just fascinating stories.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   Nick Bilton's book will be called "Hatching Twitter, a true story of money power, friendship,
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   and betrayal."
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   It comes out the next month that we will absolutely talk to him about it.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400]   It should be very interesting.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   Dorsey will make $400 to $500 million when Twitter goes public.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.600]   What do you make of this whole Frouferon?
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:57.440]   Neil Dash is involved, so I know-- and of course, you work with Neil at ThinkUp-- over
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.480]   the lack of women on the board and in the upper management of Twitter.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.320]   Do you think this is an issue?
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   Gina?
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.360]   Oh, it's always an issue for me.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:12.600]   I mean, the lack of women in any kind of-- in positions of power in general is always
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.040]   an issue of interest to me.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.960]   I know that there's been a little flatter recently.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   Right.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   So there's no women-- what's the story?
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:23.120]   There's no women on the Twitter board, and Dick was sort of quoted as saying that it's
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.920]   a big problem they have to work on, right?
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920]   Dick Joe--
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:27.920]   And he, Joe--
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.280]   His initial reaction was kind of a jokey reaction comparing the guy who's complaining
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.920]   to carrot top.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.520]   But then in the subsequent tweet, he said, "Hey, look, I'm really-- this is on my mind
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.720]   all the time we're looking."
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.000]   Although the New York Times published a great piece, Claire Kay Miller, who wrote the original
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.480]   piece about this, then published a follow-up piece with 45 women who would be perfectly
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.280]   well qualified to be on Twitter's board.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.520]   So he can't be looking that hard.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.960]   Maybe he has a buzzfeed list.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.240]   Not a very good list on my dad.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.240]   It includes Oprah.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.000]   Yeah, no, this isn't the buzzfeed list.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.280]   You know, it's a good list.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.840]   These conversations are always that there's a supply problem, right?
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.840]   This is what these guys always say.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:08.840]   There's a supply problem.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.840]   There aren't enough women--
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   Clearly not the case.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.160]   There aren't enough women executives.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.720]   From my perspective, you know, that's not the case.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.600]   But my perspective is someone who thinks about this, who lives this.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.320]   I mean, the fact is, is that you-- you know, and I think that this is natural-- you know,
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.320]   human nature.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.560]   You sort of-- you surround yourself with people who are like you.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.800]   And it's a problem.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.840]   It's definitely a problem in the Valley.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.440]   I think that if Twitter had been thinking really hard about it sooner, they wouldn't
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.480]   be having this conversation right now.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:38.880]   Do I think that they're like any more sexist than any other company in the Valley?
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880]   No.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.560]   I mean, I think this is sort of-- this is the status quo right now.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.760]   I do think that it needs to change.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.560]   And it's changing, you know, slowly.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.480]   I mean, even over the past three years, we've seen some changes.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.560]   But no, I definitely think it is an issue.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.240]   Look, anytime I go to any executive page on a company website or a conference speaker
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:02.400]   page, I immediately notice-- because these are sort of just the glasses that I look through,
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.120]   which is an issue that's close to my heart.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.480]   I notice-- I notice how many what the ratio of men to women is.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.760]   And I notice the ratio of white to brown skin people as well.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.760]   And I notice--
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.760]   Well, that's another point.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   It's all white men.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.760]   And I notice age as well.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.440]   You know, if it's always, you know, if it's all young people, that makes me nervous.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.680]   If it's all older people, that also makes me nervous.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.120]   So, you know, I--
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.200]   Three of 10 on Google's border women.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.200]   OK.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200]   That's not terrible.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.920]   I have mixed feelings about them.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.080]   I mean, I don't know if you-- I mean, it's not a-- it's these are private companies.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.280]   It's not like-- I mean, I agree.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.920]   And believe me, my company's run by women, so I'm not--
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's a values expression.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.560]   I mean, Leo, you clearly care about this because you just look at the makeup of your
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.080]   hosts and your management, your leadership.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.080]   This is clearly something.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.840]   I mean, if you're not even thinking-- if you're not thinking about it explicitly, you're
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.280]   at least the kind of person who surrounds himself by people who are different than him,
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   right?
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   And I mean, that's the reason why I'm here.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.920]   And this is the other thing, is that hiring women makes it easier to hire more-- you know,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:06.920]   more women.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   Yes, that's good.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.480]   Hiring people of color makes it easier to hire more people of color, right?
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.720]   Because, you know, people notice these things as my rant.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   That's my rant.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.920]   The two of eight on Facebook are women.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.360]   But I hate to do it by quota, like, oh, well, we got a rest.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360]   Of course.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   No, I think-- but the point is, it's not hard.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360]   You can do it.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.000]   And by the way, I nominate Susan Crawford to any board.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   Yeah, put her on.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.200]   And it's a number, by the way, not 45, but 25-- Claire Kane Miller's list of 25 women
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.360]   who would be appropriate to be on Twitter, where many of them are on boards of other
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   very big companies.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:45.520]   Yeah, I think that the supply argument has some legs if you're trying to talk about large
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520]   numbers, right?
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:49.440]   You have 100 speakers at a conference.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.280]   And if you only have one woman, that's bad.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.080]   But to try to argue that you're going to get 70, that's maybe hard.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.800]   Okay, I will grant that.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.600]   Or a whole staff, it's harder.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.040]   This has been an issue in journalism for years, trying to get people of color in a
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.760]   newsroom is very difficult.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.480]   Just because of the numbers that are there.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.440]   All right, so there is-- at the gross level, there's a supply problem.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.360]   But if you're filling a board, then just not thinking of this going in.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.000]   The other thing that's argued, too, is not just diversity of gender and race.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.400]   It's also a perspective.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.280]   You get companies like Google, having someone from India on that board is important because
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.320]   having international perspectives on these boards are important.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.720]   Twitter is primarily an international company.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.360]   So that's an issue, too.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.680]   You've got-- and Gina's right.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:42.440]   It's enlightened self-interest to connect yourselves to other networks of people.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.600]   And the board is one way to do that.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.160]   So they should be doing it.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.080]   I got to say, I mean, I got to say, I didn't think, oh, I need to have a woman running
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   the company.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:26:00.560]   I do think about the representation on air because I want to make sure that girls don't
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.600]   think that this is a male-- that technology is just for men.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.880]   So I do think about that a little bit in terms of hosts.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.280]   But I didn't choose Lisa as a CEO because she was a woman.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.480]   I chose her because she was the right candidate.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.280]   She was the best person for the job.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.160]   And she also wanted-- I mean, she asked for the job.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.840]   I mean, I got asked, but she put herself on a-- and I have a part of revealing anything,
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   right?
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.480]   But she made herself a candidate, which is something that women need to do more on.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.240]   Well, that's something Lisa's very good.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.040]   She does not stand offish.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:38.800]   She is-- and this is-- isn't this what Cheryl Sandberg talks a little bit about too?
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.280]   She is just like a guy in that respect.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.280]   She says, no, I'm the right person.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.280]   Yeah, how about me?
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.280]   How about me?
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.920]   Because we said-- we actually went to her and said, do you have anybody who could recommend
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   to be our CFO?
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.160]   She said, yeah, me.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.160]   She said, yeah, me.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.880]   And the truth is when she said that, I said, really?
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   You would consider that?
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.200]   And she said, yeah, I said, you're hired.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.640]   Because she was the right person.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.680]   And we do try to get on air-- and channel vouch for this.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.560]   A lot of times, the Twit panel on Sundays is all men.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.040]   And I say, can't we get any women?
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.560]   I also say, can't we get any people of color?
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.120]   That's actually harder than women.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.640]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.600]   Well, this is-- yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.840]   I'm sure on our industry that's true.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.000]   So but I also hate-- it's funny.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.040]   I hate to say, oh, you've got to have women.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.120]   So it's not quoted to think properly, it's--
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.440]   again, I'll say it one more time.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.360]   It's a lightness of interest.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.920]   It's saying that I'm going to--
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.560]   Gina said, well, you're going to tie yourself
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.080]   into various networks of people, have different perspectives.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.800]   That's what you want to see illustrated.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.000]   Yes, because it's good business.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.480]   And it's not about trying to hit a number.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.120]   Good business.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.560]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.520]   I want to get our tip, our tool, our number of the week.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.800]   I guess my tool-- I'm going to talk a little bit
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.720]   about this galaxy here.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.160]   I haven't really done a lot with it,
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.360]   but it's what I can tell you a little bit about my initial--
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.000]   It looks so fashionable on your layout.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.480]   It actually looks good, I think.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.560]   It looks pretty nice.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.840]   It looks really nice.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.840]   Oh, it's on there's a screen.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.840]   Yeah, very nice.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.360]   It's got a--
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.360]   It's got a--
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.800]   Oh, that's a screen board.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.720]   Huh?
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.920]   All it needs is one of those tiny keyboards.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.000]   I'm a pocket protector.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:15.600]   I don't know.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.480]   I think it's better than that.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.000]   But I don't think-- I don't know.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.160]   We'll talk about it.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.360]   All right, we'll find it.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.200]   Let me talk first about another new advertiser.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.400]   I am so happy to have personal capital on--
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.320]   we interviewed the founder of personal capital,
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:35.120]   former PayPal guy, a really smart guy, talking about--
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.320]   this is the new thing.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.440]   For years, I used to quicken and I balanced my checkbooks.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.840]   And I did it all in my head.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:45.480]   And I got an online stock account.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.080]   And this is the next generation.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.000]   Beyond even budgeting and managing your checkbook,
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.960]   this isn't managing your financial life.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.080]   Personal capital.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.480]   The problem, of course, is that you're so busy making a living
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.600]   that you often don't have time to manage the living you're making.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.920]   You've got accounts everywhere checking savings nowadays.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:09.600]   This is so true.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.640]   Retirement, credit.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.120]   And you've got to keep track of all this
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.200]   by seeing it as a unified whole.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.520]   And that's what this is done.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.720]   This is really interesting.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.920]   It combines all your financial accounts, personal capital.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.200]   You can visit it personal capital.com, find out more.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.080]   Combines all your financial accounts,
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.240]   gives you a total real time snapshot of all your finances,
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.640]   graphs, charts, reports.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.120]   I've been using it for over a year since we had the founder
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.280]   on the show.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.760]   And it's really great.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.600]   I guess you could say it's almost like a financial GPS.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.240]   You can use it for free personal capital.com/twig
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.240]   is our website.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.840]   Just takes a minute.

[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.280]   You'll be giving it some financial information.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:57.960]   But it's using the mainstream stuff to keep track of it.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.440]   It really works really, really well.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.520]   And ultimately, it is, I think, a first step
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:08.560]   into building a personal portfolio, a wealth management.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.200]   You can analyze the fees on your 401(k), your mutual funds.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.720]   You can look at your asset allocation in your portfolio
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.800]   and of course see where your money is going.

[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.680]   Smart investing means seeing the big picture.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.440]   And I think it's time to start today.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.160]   Whatever your level is.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.760]   You know, man, I wish somebody had pulled me aside.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.880]   I wish these tools were available when I was in my 20s.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.520]   Somebody pulled me aside and said, you know,
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.360]   you really ought to be putting money in the 401(k),
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.520]   you really ought to allocate your assets this way.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.200]   We didn't have anything like this.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:47.960]   We've got it now.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.280]   And I want you to take a look at it.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.000]   personal capital.com/twig.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.720]   It is fab-boo.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.920]   And I can say that I'm having used it now for more than a year.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.920]   Let us get our tool and tip and number of the week
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.680]   starting with everybody saying, well,
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.360]   why aren't you going to talk about the new Google Maps?
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.080]   Gina Tarpani.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.960]   This just got published.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.480]   I think we might have even started the show.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.320]   We might have been in pre-show.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.000]   Google Maps rolling out two new really nice features.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.960]   First, this is in the Google Maps preview,
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.640]   the new redesigned Google Maps.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.680]   Directions for multiple destinations.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.840]   I guess is one of the most requested features
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.720]   in the new Google Maps.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.480]   So when you pop in a destination, you ask for directions,
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   this is rolling out solely.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.600]   And I actually don't have it in my Google Maps yet.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.920]   So you might not have it in yours coming out next weeks
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.640]   for the next few days, maybe.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.720]   There is a plus sign.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.320]   So you can add another destination.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.600]   So you can plan a multi-destination.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.760]   Oh, I love that.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.800]   Road trip or cycling trip.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.960]   Yeah, really nice.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.480]   What else we got here?
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.520]   A few other things.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.280]   You could see your flight hotel and restaurant reservations
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.400]   in right in Maps.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.720]   Just search for your departing airport or dining destination
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.760]   will instantly show your upcoming plans.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.680]   This is a really nice integration with the Gmail,
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:05.680]   linking your data across--
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.840]   It's kind of like trip it.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.960]   Oh, very interesting.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:09.840]   Very nice.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.760]   And upcoming events.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.840]   So if you search for something like Radio City Music Hall,
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.040]   for example, local performance venues,
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.720]   you'll see the upcoming events card.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:21.920]   Again, we have these the cards, which is Google's new design,
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.880]   most modern design language.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:27.240]   You'll see a schedule of concerts, sports matches,
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.000]   and other events happening near you.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.520]   So yeah, some really nice updates there are maps.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.600]   Again, I'm not seeing this in my current maps,
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.440]   but should be coming out, rolling out the next couple weeks.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.120]   Yeah, I don't have it either.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.040]   When they updated maps, I was kind of disappointed
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.000]   because it got so stark.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.040]   It did less.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:46.520]   Yes.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.440]   I guess that was laying the foundation
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:51.560]   for what they're going to do, which was add to it.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.640]   I swear that Google takes away stuff just
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.600]   to see what they get the most complaints about,
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.040]   and then adds that back in slowly.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:57.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.080]   I think that's how they do it.
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.800]   I'd be a little worried if-- I use Tripit.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.760]   I love Tripit.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.320]   Tripit monitors my Gmail.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.600]   When it sees confirmation emails,
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.400]   it builds an itinerary automatically for me.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.240]   It's a website and an app.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.000]   And I used it on this most recent trip.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.800]   And it's a really great way to keep track of stuff
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.880]   to know when your confirmations aren't stuff.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.880]   But if that were built in automatically to Google Maps--
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:18.680]   Tripit is great.
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.840]   And I should say this blog post says
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.880]   this will be rolling out today, so we should see it today.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   Oh, good.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.600]   I agree though.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.800]   I love Tripit.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.080]   But it just sort of makes sense that that would be a Google
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.040]   Now thing.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.160]   It's scary.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.120]   If you're a company, the Google knows everything
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.640]   about everybody.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.520]   It's very hard to compete in certain spaces.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.520]   The information--
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.000]   Relationships.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.520]   Relationships are the future of our business.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.680]   Jeffrey Jarvis.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.000]   Numero?
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   Numero Scepter.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.560]   That we don't play.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.640]   How do you say that in Turkish?
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.720]   You'll find out from Google Now.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.080]   OK, Google Now.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.080]   How do I say number please in Turkish?
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.000]   Unfortunately, it doesn't say it out loud.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.680]   Oh, totally nice.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.640]   But it does show it, which is cool.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.000]   Oh, no, it doesn't.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.480]   Oh, I think I'm supposed to say translate or something, right?
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:10.960]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.520]   Well, never mind.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:17.440]   So the number of URLs taken down by Google
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.920]   has gotten to be amazing.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.760]   More than eight pirate links quote,
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.680]   end quote pirate links every second.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.040]   What do you mean taken down?
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.960]   Like taken out of the search results?
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.680]   Yeah, wow.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.720]   So between-- in the summer of 2012,
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.920]   Google got 1.8 million link takedown notices a week.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.080]   That's increased now to 5.3 million a week.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:45.880]   A 4,000% increase covering 5,400 copyright owners
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.480]   of 37,000 domains.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.000]   So the claim that Google's not doing anything
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.840]   in the copyright is BS.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.480]   Then, in the same story from the Guardian,
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.760]   it says that a report published by the London School
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:00.720]   of Economics found that, quote, "evidence does not support
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.120]   claims about overall revenue reduction
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.160]   due to individual online copyright infringement."
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:07.640]   Oh.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.600]   So it's saying that, for example, UK revenues from online music
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.800]   were higher than revenues for both CD and vinyl combined
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.000]   for the first time in 2013.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.840]   Worldwide sales of recorded music
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.320]   increased in 2012 for the first time since 1999.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.240]   The movie industry, despite claims of piracy,
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.360]   is devastating them, found revenues hit $35 billion,
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.880]   making a 6% increase over 2011.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.040]   And this quote, "File shares in the UK
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.040]   were found to spend more on content than those who only
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.800]   consumed legal content, demonstrating the potential
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.360]   boost to legal digital content sales as a result of content
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.040]   sampling."
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.240]   Notice the verb, sampling.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:49.840]   Sampling.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.920]   I received.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.880]   I ran a-- at all, most of the day,
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.800]   panel at a World Economic Reform event last week here in New York.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.040]   And it was all about trying to understand this era
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.600]   and trying to get to a new regime.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.080]   And pretty much everybody in the room,
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.480]   there are a lot of showbiz companies in the room,
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.880]   admitted that copyright's broken, that it's not the solution,
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.720]   that suing people and fighting people is not the solution.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.680]   I fought against using the words copyright
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.600]   and intellectual property, even in the discussion,
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.400]   because it's a presumption to think it's property,
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.800]   and that's the way we look at it.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.680]   So I hope that maybe we can start
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.680]   to head toward a senior view of what sampling and sharing
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.800]   and creation means.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.960]   So that's it for my highfalutin number.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:30.960]   I want to do one more thing.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.280]   Get your classes ready, folks.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:32.880]   Get them ready.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.400]   Get them ready.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.360]   The man who created the concept of the Gutenberg
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.160]   parenthesis that I talked about in the show,
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.920]   he claimed Pettit, who's a professor in the southern Denmark,
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.280]   is coming to speak at my school at CUNY on October 17.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.960]   Just Google Gutenberg parenthesis, CUNY, October 17,
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:54.560]   you'll find it.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.240]   And if you're in New York, come on by.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.080]   Cool.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.520]   Thomas Pettits.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.320]   He's coming to town.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.480]   Coming to New York, and the Gutenberg parenthesis will have--
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.600]   we should actually-- what we should do is have scotch there
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.120]   like Apple meetings, and everybody can downwind.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:13.040]   Every time we say Gutenberg.
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.440]   He's from USD, the University of Southern Denmark.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.840]   I love it.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.000]   I love it.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.040]   Not other than Denmark.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.040]   No, no, no.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.000]   Don't be confused.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.160]   There's a big difference.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.480]   It's kind of a rivalry going on.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.960]   So the galaxy here is here.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.760]   I'm going to review this--
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.920]   by the way, it only works right now with the galaxy note.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.760]   So I have the note 3 and the galaxy here.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:42.440]   I will review both on Tuesday, on before you buy.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.680]   But it's kind of-- the pairing is very interesting.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.560]   So it comes with a cradle that you
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.520]   put the watch into charge it.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.680]   I don't yet know what the battery life is,
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.800]   but I suspect not very long.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.960]   And the cradle also has an NFC chip on it.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.440]   So in order to pair this, you could do it manually.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.680]   You tap the phone on the cradle.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.960]   The phone says, oh, you have a galaxy gear.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.760]   Would you like to download the software?
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.240]   And you do.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.080]   And it automatically sets up the Bluetooth and everything,
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.120]   which is kind of cool.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.440]   This is the gear manager.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.000]   And you can see the gear is connected.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.600]   The gear-- this is pretty much out of the box.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.840]   By the way, great looking OLED screen.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.800]   It is a touchscreen.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.160]   So I can swipe through, look at contacts, logs--
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.560]   with its call logs, by the way, missed calls and so forth.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.640]   But I could see who called me and who didn't call me.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.040]   I can also run a variety of apps.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040]   And you can see you install the apps from your phone.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.440]   So you can see what apps are installed, including S voice.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.840]   So I guess I can dictate it to it.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.000]   And that's a Samsung App Store.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:43.520]   Yes.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.800]   All of this is Samsung.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.320]   This is not-- in fact, playing my almost immediate reaction
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.640]   to the Note 3 is, oh, I can't do it,
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.680]   because it's so Samsungized.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.800]   For instance, on the Note 3, you have a swipe up,
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.000]   which reminds me a little bit of the swipe up
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.920]   on the iPhone 5.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.920]   That gives me some sort of weird--
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.680]   I mean, I don't know if it's bad,
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.480]   but it's just like--
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.080]   this is not--
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.000]   How do you get to Google now?
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.440]   Well, right.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.800]   And then the touch whiz is so different.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.520]   And I don't know.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:23.520]   I probably have to customize this thing.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.080]   Maybe even--
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.680]   anyway, the watch is pairs with it.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.120]   It does require the Galaxy gear.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:29.840]   A couple of things.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.280]   When you get up and walk away from your phone,
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.560]   the gear buzzes and says you've lost the Bluetooth connection.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:36.280]   You won't lose your phone that way.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.680]   You can also do it in the other direction.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:38.640]   I can say, find my gear.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.280]   Where'd I leave my watch?
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.720]   Where is it?
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.000]   And we'll find your gear.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.600]   The gear turns itself off.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.520]   The thing-- yeah, I look at a watch that's always on.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.320]   Yeah, that's not how this works.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.080]   It does allow you to choose watch face.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.120]   I mean, it's not a watch.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:55.760]   It's something else.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.680]   It does allow you to choose watch faces.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.640]   I'm using the weather clock, but it has other watch faces,
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.160]   including a pedometer clock, because there's
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.680]   a pedometer built into it so you can see how your steps are
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.080]   going.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.240]   I like the idea of being able to swipe through this.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.440]   It has a camera right here.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:14.880]   I haven't really played much with that yet.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.000]   I just got it.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.560]   But it's media controller.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.040]   I can see a gallery of images I've
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.080]   taken on my camera, that kind of thing.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:23.520]   I don't know.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   I'm intrigued.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.200]   I really was expecting something really
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.520]   horrific from all the reviews.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.240]   I think it looks all right.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.560]   It's rubber band.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.280]   Yeah, it's not bad looking.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.600]   I mean, that's not the best, because it's not horrible looking.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:41.560]   It's not horrible.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.440]   How much is it?
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.880]   I think a couple hundred bucks, right?
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.040]   And you have to have the note, at least for now,
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.400]   although they say that with the upgrade to KitKat,
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.120]   is it KitKat or 4.3?
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:53.680]   I can't remember.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.320]   With the upgrade on the GS4 and the GS3,
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.600]   you should be able to use this with some of the other Samsung
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.440]   devices.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.680]   No word yet as whether it'll work with anything besides Samsung.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.080]   My guess is not.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.280]   So I'll have a full review.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.920]   I mean, there's--
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.640]   I think there's room in this marketplace.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.240]   I have a--
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.960]   Yeah, most interesting is not this device per se,
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.720]   but what they're keeping up, what
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.400]   they can do.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.680]   It's just-- it's early, early days yet.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.560]   And while Glass is interesting, I
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.200]   would love to see Google now here.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.000]   Somewhere, it needs to be easier to see than pulling out
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.400]   the phone.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.080]   300 bucks, $299.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.560]   I mean, I spent a lot more than that for a watch.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.960]   It's not the most attractive watch ever.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.680]   But I'll have a full review for you
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.560]   after I've played with this for a little bit longer.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:46.760]   Just put it together yesterday.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.480]   And yes, it has an excellent ad.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.440]   So that's good.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:50.840]   That's a good thing.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.920]   Oh, yeah, that ad was good.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.720]   Yeah, it was pretty cute.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:56.280]   Should we show the Galaxy Gear ad?
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.520]   All right.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:58.920]   It's--
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.360]   I remember saying that it was a ripoff from Apple's Hello ad,
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.120]   but it was only rip off insofar as that it was a mashup
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.240]   of people using a smartwatch.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.560]   And Apple did an ad in like 2007 of people
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.280]   saying hello into the phone.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.080]   No, this is-- I think this is kind of cool,
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.120]   because there it is.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.680]   It's a clear transmitter.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.680]   All right.
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.960]   Thanks on the nostalgia.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.360]   We've wanted to talk to our watches for years.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:25.960]   Yes.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.360]   One time is 8.29.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:28.960]   Thank you.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.000]   Sorey.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.280]   This is '86 reporting in a--
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.320]   Oh, this cost a fortune in Korean rights.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:33.960]   You think so?
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.400]   Yeah, I guess they had a buy-all of these.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.760]   Oh, my god.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.040]   And a rut.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:38.560]   Oh, my god.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.240]   That one is a lot right there.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.280]   A jink of jink of caramel.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.800]   Jink of caramel.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:43.960]   I read you.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.840]   This is a secret agent rock slag.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.400]   OK, partner, let's make a little spectacular.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.400]   Anything particular in mind?
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.200]   The atomic coast.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.200]   There's only one man who can get us out of here in time.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.440]   I'll be down right away.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.080]   I'm on my way.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.080]   We're on our way.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.840]   I'm on my way.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.240]   We're on our way.
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:01.600]   Wow.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.840]   I'm on my way.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.400]   Pretty good, huh?
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.080]   It is.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:06.600]   Jesus.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.640]   That-- that-- that is an expensive, expensive ad.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.880]   Well, you know?
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.800]   Apple's iWatch is still at least six months off.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.520]   So--
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:18.600]   Grab the turf.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:19.800]   That's like this is the future now.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.720]   Well, there's a war-- there's a race going on now, right?
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.880]   You also-- we didn't talk about it.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.720]   It's kind of stupid.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.280]   But the Samsung curved face phone,
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.600]   they just kind of just beat LG out with it.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.080]   And Samsung wants to beat Apple out with the watch.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.760]   And so that's Samsung's way now.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.400]   It's just to be faster than everybody.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.480]   Well, it's good.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.120]   It's good for us.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:39.680]   Competition.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.480]   We love it.
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.080]   Yes.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.760]   We also love Jeff Jarvis from the City University
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.000]   of New York, where he teaches journalism to young people
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.040]   whose minds have not yet been molded by television
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:50.880]   and the internet.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.800]   They've never seen a screen in their life.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.440]   No.
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.560]   Otherwise, why would they be in a journalism school?
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.440]   Their scribe is up in the world.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.320]   Inks stained wretches all.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.160]   He's also the author of a good number of fine tomes,
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.640]   including public parts, his most recent.
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.480]   What would Google do?
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.760]   And of course, Gutenberg the Geek at 99.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.080]   And now available in German as Gutenberg
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:20.440]   there neared and on Audible as an Audible single.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.960]   Ooh.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:22.520]   Who reads it?
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.360]   You?
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:23.840]   Me?
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:24.800]   I can't wait.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.200]   I'm downloading it right now as we speak.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.240]   Thank you, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.720]   Also, thanks to Nina Travani, smarterware.org
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.120]   for filling in for me for three solid weeks.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:37.960]   Of course.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.880]   So glad to have you back.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.120]   Really glad to have you back.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.080]   She's also the host of All About, one of the hosts of All
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.280]   About Android, which is every Tuesday.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.640]   Great show if you're into Android.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.960]   You've got to watch it.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.880]   Yeah, we talked about curved screens.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.720]   Curved screens?
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.200]   I don't know.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.880]   That seems like a gimmick to me.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:52.480]   I don't-- maybe--
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.280]   I agree.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.960]   Maybe someday we'll say, god, these phones were so flat.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.400]   How did we ever use them?
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:57.840]   I know.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.200]   We're not going to ever say that.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.640]   We also have the FireTube.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.280]   Amazon copyrighted term or trademarked the term FireTube.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.520]   And the rumor is that it's a Chromecast-like thing.
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.120]   I want a FireTube on my TV.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.600]   Well, that puts some pressure on Google.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:16.000]   Open up your GD platform.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:17.360]   It's true.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.280]   Open it up.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.440]   You know what it does tell me is not
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.280]   going to be an Amazon streaming app on that,
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.200]   because that's what I was really hoping for.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.200]   Amazon, I would buy more stuff on Amazon.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.240]   The reason I'm buying these shows on Google Play
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.680]   is because of Chromecast.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:33.880]   And I'm not going to buy another device, a FireTube.
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:36.160]   What's that?
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:36.840]   Amazon just--
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.080]   And you're running out of HDMI port.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.200]   Put it in the app.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.760]   You've always done that, Kindle.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.840]   It's been on every platform.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:43.840]   You sell a Kindle.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.000]   But you could still use it on an iPhone or Android phone.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   Let's do the same thing, shall we?
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.200]   I'm just saying.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:49.960]   Agreed.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.240]   Completely agreed.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.560]   Hey, thanks for joining us.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:46:00.120]   We do this show every Wednesday at 2000 UTC on Twit.TV.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.160]   Please tune in and watch us live.
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.400]   But if you can't, we also have on-demand audio and video
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.720]   available after the fact.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.680]   Twit.TV/Twig or wherever you subscribe to your podcast.
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.760]   You can get every week.
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.640]   It's the best way to do it.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.800]   That way you've got every single episode.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:15.640]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.520]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.700]   (upbeat music)
