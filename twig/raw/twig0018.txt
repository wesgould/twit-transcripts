[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.240]   It's time for this week in Google to show the covers,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.200]   not just Google, but all things cloudy.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880]   And on the line with us back from her sojourn in England,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.720]   it's the wonderful Agena Trapani.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.640]   Nice to see you, Gina.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520]   Thanks for coming back to us.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.280]   Great to be back.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.880]   I missed you guys.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.280]   I didn't have my hour-long tech therapy session last week.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   So great to be back.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.920]   Good.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.760]   Good.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.160]   Well, we missed you terribly.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.280]   We're really glad to have you back.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.040]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.120]   Held down the fort while you were gone.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.760]   Good to see you, Jeff.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   Always good to be here.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.320]   And I'm glad to see Gina's got a little plaid behind her
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.680]   because we have our resident Scott in studio with us,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.080]   so to speak, via Skype.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.920]   Pete Cashmore from Aberdeen.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.360]   Hey, Pete.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.400]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.520]   Pete's, of course, the creator of Mashable, editor-in-chief,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.360]   of that great website that covers web 2.0,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.400]   better than just about anybody,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.360]   m-a-s-h-a-b-l-e.com.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.080]   And he's @mashable.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.560]   And Gina is @Genatrapani.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.200]   And Jeff is @Jeff Jarvis on Twitter,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.360]   if you want to berate them.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.800]   And I'm at Leo Laport.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.920]   And let's talk about Google.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.160]   Did you get to install--
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.680]   I tried.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.640]   I came very close to getting Chromium OS working, Gina.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   But then I had to leave for Thanksgiving.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.240]   Did you get to play with it at all?
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.520]   I played with it as the virtual machine image,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.800]   which was pretty slow.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.040]   But yeah, I wasn't so excited about it.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.480]   And then the announcement came out,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.680]   and I started reading all the coverage.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.200]   And then I got really excited about it.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.960]   And when I tried it, I mean, I'm feeling pretty optimistic
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.160]   about it, pretty bullish about it,
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.200]   look cautiously.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600]   I mean, I live in my web browser already.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.800]   I write for most of my writing is for websites,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.720]   except for the book.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.920]   Well, my current book, I'm actually
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.720]   writing an immediate wiki installation.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   So I am writing on the web.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.680]   Writing in wiki?
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.280]   But everything else is in the web.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.520]   You're actually writing it in wiki?
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.480]   Yeah, the-- yeah, the--
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.280]   The complete waveguide.com.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.000]   The whole book is in Media Wiki, which
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.800]   is the software that Power R's Wikipedia.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.720]   And yeah, I just hit that edit button
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.480]   and type right into that text field.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.360]   I know it's risky because I've had web browsers crash on me.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.920]   But that's happening less and less.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.960]   And even when I was writing at Life Hacker,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.920]   I would type all my posts inside the web browser.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.520]   I wasn't drafting them in text editors.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.360]   Although I know other browser-- other bloggers, excuse me,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.760]   that do write in a text editor.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.960]   Actually, I'd be interested to know if Pete writes in his browser
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.920]   or in a regular text editor.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.520]   Do you work in your CMS, Pete?
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.600]   You know, I'm so used to WordPress that everything I do,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.240]   even if it's for someone else.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.520]   I do a call that's in.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.000]   And now it insists on doing it in the WordPress interface
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.560]   because I just don't use desktop software anymore.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.000]   But Gina, you don't use--
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.640]   Yeah, you do.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.360]   You don't use Wiki syntax when you write, though.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   Do you?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.080]   I mean, brackets and stuff like that, Gina.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.960]   Well, now that I'm working on the book
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.640]   and we are using Media Wiki, yeah.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.960]   I mean, I've gotten used to using Wiki syntax.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.560]   Like, the footnotes and things, we're using Media Wiki plugins
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.320]   to generate those automatically.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.640]   So I am sort of getting used to that.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.840]   And when I was writing Life Hacker, I was writing HTML.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.720]   I was typing out my ATAGs, my link tags, my image tags.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.440]   And so you just kind of get used to it.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.600]   I mean, I'm sure most people don't write that way.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   But you know what my--
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.520]   I use text expanders to do all my tags.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.960]   So if I type AHref, it types out the whole Href thing.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.680]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.600]   I was doing the same thing.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.480]   And I'm doing similar things for the Wiki markup as well.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.640]   But yeah, so I live in a web browser anyway.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.800]   So Chrome OS makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.180]   Although I think that, you know,
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.760]   a groupers' comment about it being, you know, replacing
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.560]   your second car with a bicycle was actually
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.000]   a very good analogy.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You know.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Before we get to--
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.360]   Yeah, Chrome OS is going to run a netbook.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   Before we get to Chrome OS--
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.920]   It's a secondary computer.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.440]   As long as we're completing this sake, Jeff, what are you
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.360]   writing?
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.480]   I write in WordPress mostly.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.800]   If I'm going to be offline, I'll go to text edit.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.280]   So I don't mess it up with those stupid Microsoft bad
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.280]   characters.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.720]   But I had to do the book in Word.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.560]   Are any of you at all interested in Office 2010,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.640]   the web versions, as we're talking about cloud computing,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.520]   that that sounds like we've got three people who live on the
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.720]   web who aren't going to use--
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.200]   they're not even using Google Docs.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.120]   That's really interesting.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.120]   It's either going to be the web browser, just a plain text
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.680]   editor.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.120]   I mean, I use a plain text editor to food and to write when
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.720]   I'm offline or if I'm writing something, you know,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.280]   that's not going to be published on the web, which is
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.240]   rare for me.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.600]   Yeah, I'm not that excited about Microsoft Office Online.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.640]   I just kind of feel like, you know, Google Docs, Oho,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.560]   been there, done that.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   And I don't know.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.040]   I'm thinking about nightmare things like curly braces or,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.360]   you know, curly apostrophes and autocorrect nightmares and
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   HTML export.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.720]   Smart quotes.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.800]   All things that I kind of--
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.200]   Smart quotes.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.040]   Yeah, smart quotes.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.240]   All those things that it wants to do for you, whether you
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.760]   want it or not like a nanny.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.840]   Right.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.520]   And then when you try to undo something, you've got to
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.720]   delve into Bill's brain.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.760]   Or worse, Clippy's brain.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.400]   That's really interesting, because one of the things I
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.480]   thought about with Chromium at Chrome OS was that Microsoft in
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.320]   a way was playing right into Google's hand by making the
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.880]   next version of Office essentially, you know, live on the
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.920]   web.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.720]   But it sounds like it's too little too late anyway.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.240]   It's like over for them.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.920]   Is Chrome OS a threat to Macintosh to Microsoft?
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.880]   Let me ask Pete, because we kind of heard Gina.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.760]   We kind of heard Gina's opinion that it's--
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.480]   you agree with Gruber that it's like switching to a
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   bicycle.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.880]   Pete, what do you think?
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.720]   Well, I think, you know, increasingly we're asking
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.560]   whether we need the OS.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.600]   I certainly just live in the browser, whatever I--
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.360]   you know, the OS is really irrelevant to me.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.200]   You know, I think I really like the Mac hardware.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.120]   So I probably not be having one of these netbooks.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.600]   That's kind of an interesting choice.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   I think that's on Google's part to say we're going to have,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.120]   you know, premium hardware specification.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.720]   But it wasn't-- now, Gina, have you installed native
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.840]   Chrome OS yet?
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.080]   No, not yet.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.320]   I only have my Mac with me, and I'm traveling right now.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.840]   So-- but as soon as I get home to my PC, I mean, they're
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.080]   going to try to boot from the USB.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.200]   Or I might-- you know, I've got a netbook in the house,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.240]   see if I can get that to go.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.160]   You know, I heard a lot of people kind of complaining that
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.960]   there was, you know, certain hardware specs that are going
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.080]   to provide, you know, the Google certified Google experience
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.800]   is only going to be for certain kinds of hardware.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.840]   But the fact that it's open source just means that, you
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.680]   know, surely there'll be images and executables that
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.040]   will work on lots of different kinds of hardware, just not
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.560]   officially supported by Google.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.080]   Right.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.920]   I mean, that's what we did.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.960]   I use this Hexa.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   The guy's name is Hexa.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.440]   He's on Twitter @@sign, H-E-X-X-E-H.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.120]   And he made a bootable image.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   He's in the UK, actually.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.760]   He made a bootable image and then
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.960]   had instructions for creating it.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.680]   And on the Mac, on Windows, or on Linux,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.960]   if you go to his website, carbon.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.480]   @H-E-X-X-E-H.net/chromiumOS.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.200]   Is that the virtual LEO or is that not USB?
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.720]   No, no, no.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:28.920]   It's a boot.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.240]   It makes a USB boot drive.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.920]   And also, so I was up on the front of the--
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.400]   Oh, and it works on the Mac as well?
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.920]   Well, now, this is an interesting thing.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.760]   I don't think it does work on a Mac.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.040]   But what I've been doing is putting--
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.120]   I should try it on the Mac.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.440]   I've been putting it in different machines and booting.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.000]   And it boots in a-- well, the Mac cut said this last week.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.720]   And I would expect that what Matt had made
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.360]   is very similar to what this ends up being.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.000]   This is just a-- you just compile it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.640]   And it works in a surprisingly broad range of stuff.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.040]   I would buy a USB.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.160]   I just looked at eBay to see if anybody was selling them.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.560]   And unfortunately, all I found was vitamins under chromium.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.280]   You need more chromium.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.600]   I'm not-- quasi-geek that I am.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.880]   I just buy the USB and put it in.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.720]   I did that with the patch stick for the Apple TV.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.800]   So I'm with you on that.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.560]   I think that's not a bad way to go.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.680]   On the front of me, there's a story
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.320]   that a Dell employee customized the OS for the Dell Mini 10V.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.240]   And so-- and announced that to the world.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.480]   So in that sense, Dell's almost selling Chrome now.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.640]   By the way, when I looked at the specs for that machine,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.960]   I was really amused that the one next up on it
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.880]   is called a Twitter machine, the Mini Twitter.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.720]   That's interesting.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.120]   What you do that's special for Twitter,
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.400]   but it says it's the machine that's ideal for Twitter.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.320]   It's all you need to Twitter.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:48.760]   Yes.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.880]   But I think that this survey that we did right
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.040]   at the beginning here was very telling that here we've
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.320]   got three professional writers.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.840]   And none of them are using a word processor, let alone
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.880]   Microsoft Office.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.760]   You're not even using Google Docs.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.400]   They're working in their CMS.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.680]   They're working in basically a form on a web page.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.960]   So Chrome OS is plenty for you guys.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.640]   And you guys are pros.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.800]   I mean, that means-- that tells me a lot.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.720]   It means a lot of people.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.640]   It's mainly the offline question that I still
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.240]   scratch my head about is that gears--
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.200]   we'll talk later, I think, about the changes in Gmail
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.160]   for offline.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.400]   But it's not sufficient yet for the plane ride.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.800]   Right.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.360]   Yeah, that's the issue.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.400]   The offline thing, I think, is an issue.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   Well--
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.720]   It's not hard to fix, I don't think, is it?
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   I could-- I mean, it works fine for me
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.280]   to use gears to do calendar updates.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.720]   It's just when I get off the plane,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.920]   it syncs up to my calendar.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.560]   I don't see why it would be so hard to make a local word
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.240]   processor that then just uploads it to dots or somewhere.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.080]   Now, Chromeium OS doesn't use gears.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.320]   Does it just use HTML5's offline capability?
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.520]   Or does it use gears?
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.560]   I was confused about that.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.880]   Well, Chrome doesn't use gears, does it?
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.480]   But now that's a good question.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.880]   Chrome for Windows definitely includes gears.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.800]   It does use gears.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.760]   It has gears component.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.640]   It does.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.600]   And the Chromium build for Mac does not.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.160]   Gears doesn't work on Mac 10.6, which is my complaint
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.920]   of the week, actually.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   But I thought I saw Mark Pilgrim's tweet
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.400]   that Chromium OS, Chromium's Chrome,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.800]   is using the HTML5 offline capability versus gears.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.760]   When does that look like?
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.760]   How does that work?
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.360]   I mean, yeah, that's a good question.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.920]   I'm not sure what the differences are between gears,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.160]   capabilities, and HTML5's offline capabilities.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.960]   I mean, I do know that with Wave,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.640]   you need gears to do things like drag and drop files
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.160]   into a Wave.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.640]   But Wave takes advantage of a lot of HTML5's capabilities,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.400]   which makes me think that maybe it'll be a little limited.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   Yes, you're correct.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.760]   Will you try logging into Chromium OS?
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.200]   Well, as far as I got, because at first, I didn't know it.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.600]   I thought, oh, what's my password?
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.120]   I thought, well, I'll enter my Google account.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.760]   But the problem was I wasn't online,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.920]   so it didn't do anything that I found out later
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.440]   that this hexa has a default password, which
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.800]   wasn't documented anywhere, which is face punch, I think.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.080]   Or no, I think it's Chrome OS.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.880]   And then, anyway, it's some default things.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.720]   So truthfully, that's as far as I got.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.600]   I had it running, and then I had a leave for Thanksgiving.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.000]   So it was extraordinarily frustrating.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.480]   And then Jennifer had the painters in,
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.000]   and the bedroom got moved around and painted it.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.520]   I don't even know where anything is now.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.800]   So I've lost my Chrome OS.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.720]   You're like, that art?
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.000]   I've lost it.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.520]   She just doesn't understand.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.800]   Honey, where's my USB?
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.360]   K with Chrome OS.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   What's it look like?
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.680]   It looks like my phone.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.600]   All on your 500 USB keys you have?
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.720]   Looks like my thumb.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.200]   So according to the demo that they did of Chrome OS,
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.880]   Google turns to HTML5 to solve this.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.720]   So yes, you're absolutely right.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.560]   But that's not new.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.320]   I mean, I think that they were doing that in mobile, too.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.840]   I'd be very interested to see Gmail users HTML5.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.480]   I'd be very interested to see how that works.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.560]   So if the machine is offline, you can
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.200]   log in with credentials into Chrome, MOS.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.720]   Yes.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.080]   That's what you're saying.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.000]   You logged in with the face punch.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.480]   Yeah, both bogus credentials.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.240]   It got you in.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.480]   Yes.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.000]   Right, right.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.640]   And it just says in Chrome launches
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.080]   and just says you're not connected to the network.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.000]   I got a lot of snotty tweets from people who said,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.600]   it's your Google account.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.280]   I said, but I can't.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.480]   I'm not online.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.920]   And then they said, what goes an online operating system?
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.480]   If you're not online.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.960]   But yes, no, you can actually use it without being online.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.560]   But that is the other thing to confirm me, Leo.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.560]   I was going to get--
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.040]   I had a geek moment where Dr. Strange loved moments.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.440]   Stop me.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.200]   Stop me.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.080]   And I was going to buy that Dell or the clamshell
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.880]   that Matt Cutz used and just do it and take it
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.920]   on a trip to Washington with me, be Cutzie.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.480]   But then I realized that my AT&T laptop internet card
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.960]   isn't going to work.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   If I had MyFi, I guess that would work when I'm away
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.320]   from Wi-Fi, right?
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.160]   But otherwise, it's not going to--
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.360]   the driver is just not going to be any good, right?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.760]   Well, that's an interesting point about the MyFi.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.960]   That would work really well, actually.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.720]   What is the reason to get it, I think?
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.240]   Now I have another excuse to get that.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.320]   I love MyFi.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.040]   Oh, don't get me started talking about MyFi.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.600]   That's the sprinting Verizon both offer these credit card
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.280]   sized Wi-Fi access points that are based on EVDO.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.680]   So your EVDO works, and you've got Wi-Fi.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.440]   And it's one way I use to get my iPhone on Verizon's network.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.320]   I use Verizon's MyFi.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.760]   Works quite nicely.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.680]   I think part of Google's strategy that's
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.640]   worth bringing up there, though, is that they're
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.520]   doing this free Wi-Fi in airports.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.200]   And they're approaching it from the other angle, which is,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.320]   what if we just blanket the whole world in free Wi-Fi?
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.360]   I mean, the more people that are on the web,
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.280]   the more money Google makes.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.400]   So I think they're approaching that from the other direction,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:16.120]   which is just assume Wi-Fi everywhere in five years.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   Yeah, I think you're right, Pete.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.280]   But between now and then, there are some pain points.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.960]   Yes, like right now.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.760]   That's what I think you're absolutely right.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   That's where this strategy obviously goes.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.400]   Absolutely.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.680]   And when that happens, we're freed
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.040]   from all kinds of oligarchies.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:36.120]   I'm just looking-- somebody just sent me a link to a website
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:44.320]   for Ronix, Ph-O-R-O-N-I-X.com that has done benchmarks
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:51.520]   of Chrome OS, Moblin, which is Intel's Unix mobile OS,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.800]   and Ubuntu.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:59.240]   And I'm just trying to scan these to see which is faster.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.960]   Chrome OS uses--
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.320]   Are we talking about startup or--
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.200]   No, no, that's what's interesting about this.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.960]   It's not merely startup.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.080]   Obviously, Chrome OS is the winner on startup with seven
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.240]   seconds startup.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.560]   Nothing can do that.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.000]   But Chrome OS is the lowest average memory usage.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.080]   So it's got a low footprint.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.160]   CPU usage, Chrome OS, the highest at 66.3%.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.880]   They're running a synthetic benchmark that they use.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.440]   I'm going to have to parse all this.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.160]   This just came in.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.280]   Otherwise, I would have had it a little bit better.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.880]   You know, Leo, one thing I was wondering about too
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.520]   is that if you really push the Chrome OS stats to the limit,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.960]   how cheap can a machine get?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.400]   Right.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.680]   Does this finally get to the one laptop or child level
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   where you just need--
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.280]   That would be nice.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.440]   --to need connectivity, but you need so little of the machine.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.880]   And if it operates OK offline for homework,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.840]   do we get down to a really basic, basic computer?
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.080]   It's also not fair.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.120]   These benchmarks are not fair really to Chrome OS
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.200]   because it is not really shipping.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.480]   This is a very early version I would presume.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.880]   Used more power, 15% more power than the rest.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:11.720]   Not a huge amount, 13 watts, but more power than the rest.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.240]   It could be less.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.560]   Well, and it may well be when it ships in September.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.800]   It may well be less.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.920]   I mean, it's not really fair to take a very early prerelease
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.800]   and say these are the numbers still of interest.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.360]   I'll put those numbers in the show notes
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.760]   and you can take a look at it for yourself, folks.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.040]   Speaking of anything else we want to say about Chrome OS
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.240]   before we move on, I mean--
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:38.080]   I think I made this point last week.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.800]   I think with one of the most interesting things
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.880]   is maybe that Linux to the desktop
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.520]   that we've all been talking about finally gets here
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.080]   via courtesy Google.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.680]   This may be the version of Linux
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.280]   that more people use on the desktop than any other.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.800]   Did you do any shopping in New York City, Gina,
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.640]   Black Friday?
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.600]   Did you run out and face the crowds?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.760]   Not at all.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.360]   I was actually on a plane all day yesterday.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.760]   I missed all the Black Friday sales.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.840]   I landed last night at like 10 p.m.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.760]   Yeah, I'm not much of a shopper.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.480]   I must admit.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.720]   The reason I was asking is if you'd made it to Times Square
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.400]   you could have seen that giant droid ad.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.240]   Did you hear about this?
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.840]   Yes, that sounded cool.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.600]   Yeah, I saw it in the links today.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.640]   That sounded really cool.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   That I would have liked to see.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.760]   Google Verizon Reuters,
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.280]   'cause Reuters owns the big--
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.840]   A huge screen, right?
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.160]   And somebody called RGA, I guess that's the advertiser.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.760]   That's a huge added error or a high-end ad shop.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.320]   Right.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.240]   It took over the largest displays in Times Square
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:47.080]   to do a droid ad which was also displaying Google's voice search.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.400]   Now, it doesn't work anymore, but when you call the toll-free number
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.840]   and you did a Google search by voice,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.720]   the results were displayed on the Reuters sign
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.880]   or the NASDAQ's Silent Times Square.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.400]   I'd like to know who was moderating that.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.640]   Yeah, how long before people started to game that sucker, right?
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.000]   Things got to gotten ugly.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.840]   You've searched on.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   You know, I can't find anything on YouTube on it.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.920]   Well, you'd think they'd have posted some video by now.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.480]   You would.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.760]   You would.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.120]   They had that giant red eye of Sauron.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.760]   Droid, I saw a picture of that.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.840]   So for 20 hours straight--
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.360]   actually, this has been going on for the past couple of weeks,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   but only for little chunks at a time.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.280]   But it ran all day on Friday.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.160]   So you guys-- I know you go to Times Square all the time,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.960]   Jeff, but--
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.680]   Yep, I work there.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.600]   Do you?
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.040]   Yes, Cool.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.160]   Judy, graduate school of journalism
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.280]   is next to the New New York Times building.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.000]   You know, I have to give you credit on the show from now on.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.600]   I always forget to mention CUNY.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.520]   Well, it doesn't hurt to mention the book a few times
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.200]   first, but then we go--
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.040]   OK, what would Google do?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.720]   What would Google do?
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.440]   What would Google do?
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.120]   And CUNY.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.760]   There you go.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.880]   You know what, actually, that works because I finally
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.960]   got around to getting that book on Audible this week.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.840]   So the advertising does convert.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.480]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.840]   What's your chapter on, about three, I think?
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.760]   Oh, thank you very much.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.440]   Just talking about, like, control and how you've basically
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.000]   got to give it over to the consumer.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.080]   Another book about Google is a lot, lot broader.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.600]   And I think that was kind of my expectation
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.520]   that it was going to be a book kind of broadly about Google.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.440]   But it's much, much wider about that whole transition
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.960]   of consumers taking control and companies
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.160]   having to trust people with their brand, essentially.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.320]   Yeah, that's what Jeff's so good at.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.320]   Thank you.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:37.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.080]   I wasn't fishing for that, but I'll keep fishing.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.000]   And it got to go affordable as well.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.640]   There you go.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.880]   It's a couple of times.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.360]   Two for one.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.800]   We don't have Audible in the show today,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.600]   so you can stop saying their name.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.000]   So I'm giving them free emphasis.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.480]   No, no, just kidding.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.800]   They have to pay to be here.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.040]   I'm just kidding.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.400]   I did work when we worked at Tech TV.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.680]   They would tape over the logos for Apple and Dell
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.200]   and all the computers saying, they're going to have to pay
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.280]   if they want their logo on screen.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.200]   Didn't work, by the way.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.440]   I don't think we ever got any advertising from them.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.520]   So thanks to all the people who tweeted that the show was on,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.200]   I wasn't able to do it because--
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.640]   Well, as soon as Pete tweeted it,
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.760]   but that got spread like crazy.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.440]   He's a damned vector for the virus.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.000]   King of retweets.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.960]   No, Twitter's fascinating, isn't it?
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.720]   It's just a whole ecosystem that we didn't really see coming.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.920]   No, absolutely.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.480]   And now, I mean, as you say, people
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.360]   are making Twitter computers.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.200]   You know what, though, Leo?
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.080]   I think we kind of overbaked a little bit in media.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.640]   I think we're a little bit pro-Twitter.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.120]   When you look at the graphs and you look at Facebook,
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   there's just no comparison at all.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.920]   Yeah, why doesn't Facebook get more--
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.080]   I mean, it gets attention.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   Well, it just--
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.920]   here's my theory on what gets hyped in the media.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.760]   It's what's going to drive traffic to the media
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   and what the media is using.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.120]   Twitter obviously has a broader role right now
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.800]   in how media is created in--
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.120]   it's about communicating links.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.520]   So as a publisher, I go look at my web stats
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.720]   and I see Twitter in there and I say, oh, well, Twitter
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.640]   must be important to people.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.160]   Just like maybe two years ago, we
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.680]   were running my dig where to proportion
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.720]   to how big it was.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.400]   Just because you look at your web stats,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.160]   you say, well, this is a really huge site in terms
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.480]   of referrals.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.760]   It must be-- and you get this kind of distortion around it.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.520]   It seems bigger to you than it really is.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.040]   And I think Twitter to some extent is like that.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.680]   It's still in a way us early adopters.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.920]   I think Facebook's increasingly managing
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.520]   to push traffic out to websites though.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.480]   So it's going to become a lot more visible.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.440]   It hasn't been a great platform for marketing a brand
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.120]   or a media company up until now.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.760]   But suddenly they're moving towards this page model.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.320]   And suddenly, a page is quite like a Twitter page.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.200]   It's broadcast.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.320]   You can have a big audience.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.440]   It's about building audience.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.040]   How many fans do you have?
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.960]   Kind of similar to how many followers
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.320]   you have on Twitter.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.400]   And I think it's evolving as a platform for referring
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.600]   traffic to other people.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.160]   But it used to be like clothes.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.000]   And it used to be about, hey, I'm going to connect with my friends
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.080]   or impersonal content.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.880]   And they're kind of opening it up a little bit
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.160]   to be more about sharing links.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.880]   And so we look at our traffic stats
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.480]   and we're seeing a Facebook climb and almost take on Twitter
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.000]   in terms of referred traffic.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.080]   The New York Times incorrectly, but quite publicly
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.880]   called this the first Twitter Christmas.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.160]   It's like--
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.640]   I should love those announcements.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.560]   Or maybe the New York Times.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.520]   I think it's the third Twitter Christmas.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.440]   But OK, 2006, 2007, 2008--
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   Any news if it doesn't happen to the New York Times.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.680]   The fourth.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.880]   Once upon a time, people mailed their holiday wishes
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.520]   to the North Pole and hoped for a reply on Christmas Day.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.200]   Nowadays, they're sending their wishes into cyberspace
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   and are apt to get a reply in minutes.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.080]   They still use the word cyberspace.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.440]   Yeah, cyberspace.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.240]   That's good.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.880]   It's still a capitalized web and internet.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.520]   It's so cute.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.160]   Let me check the date line on this.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.320]   This could be 2006.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.120]   No, no.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.920]   No, it's current.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   You also have--
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.120]   Is the word hyperlink in there?
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.920]   That's a company this time came up with--
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.200]   --National Dear.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.400]   Is that you?
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.120]   That seems--
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   Ashton Kutcher on the cover of Fast Company.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.360]   It's the new issue.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.920]   And it says, follow me.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.560]   In Twitter, in Facebook, Fiend be a new kind of media mogul.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.760]   Which it bothers me that he's the coverboy for it.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.640]   But I think there is something to that.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.000]   I was on Skype chat the other day with Nick Denton,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.760]   dropping names.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:46.160]   And I was speculating about a future that was beyond media
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.920]   that when this idea that we have to go to a site,
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.440]   the site comes to us.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.600]   And what is that?
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.480]   And Nick came back in his typical brilliant brevity
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   and just said, it's @stevenfry.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   Yep.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.400]   It exists.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.960]   Fry has started a million audience media business
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.040]   without media.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.640]   Well, and Ashton Kutcher too.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   I mean, come on.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.560]   This guy didn't have a career.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.920]   Did he?
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.880]   Well, what goes for one of these days?
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.840]   I mean, he's much bigger because of Twitter now, I think.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.560]   I mean, I--
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.560]   My fellow young people tell me he is well-followed
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.520]   in a certain set.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   So--
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.080]   Really?
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.040]   I can't say I'm--
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.680]   Really Pete?
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.320]   You follow us?
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   No.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.400]   But well, I do follow him on Twitter, actually.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.560]   But that's kind of how he became relevant to me.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.520]   But I do think he--
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.480]   I've apparently pissed off the chat room.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.640]   They're telling me to stick to tech.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.440]   You know nothing.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.000]   It just wasn't our audience.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.240]   We see this kind of little--
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.360]   Sorry, chat room.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:44.920]   I brought it up.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.600]   It's my fault.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.920]   You know nothing, Leo.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.880]   You know nothing.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.400]   He's huge.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.200]   No, come on.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:50.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.480]   Ashton Kutcher best at best.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.400]   A punchline.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.800]   Be--
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   Be--
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.400]   A punchline to an era.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.520]   As we look back at the 70s and, you know,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.000]   John Travolta suits, we will look back on this decade
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.960]   and Ashton Kutcher--
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.120]   And be the Kutcher decade.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.920]   And but thanks to--
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   But again, thanks to--
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.600]   Look, Oprah had a career without Twitter.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.120]   In fact, Oprah barely uses Twitter.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.760]   But Ashton has clearly used Twitter very effectively.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.920]   That's a thing, right?
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.080]   He had just enough celebrity and just enough tech savvy
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.400]   to use Twitter in a way that seemed authentic, right?
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.640]   I mean, he tweeted like regular humans did.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.160]   You know, it wasn't just a press release thing.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.720]   That's true.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   That's a very good point.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.440]   He was twittering about his personal life.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.520]   And people are really interested in celebrities' personal lives.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.760]   And he was just celebrity enough to acquire
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.920]   those 1 million followers.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.560]   I mean--
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.060]   Oh, come on.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.440]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.000]   He was celebrity enough to get on the suggested user list.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.320]   He didn't get 1 million followers.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:41.800]   Well, OK.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.600]   Well, right.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.120]   All right.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.760]   And there's a suggested user list issue.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.120]   Yeah, it's almost 4 million, though.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.760]   I think in his defense, at least, he tweets--
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   He does.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.800]   More like a human than--
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.880]   He puts content up there.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.240]   You bet.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.200]   Most celebrities.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.720]   And it's obviously him doing it.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.000]   It's not like he's employing someone or--
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.840]   No, it's genuine.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.240]   And he does quite a lot to kind of connect.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.520]   He does a Ustream as well.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.320]   Somebody told me--
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.360]   And doesn't like chats with people.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:06.880]   So--
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.440]   Somebody told me--
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   At least it's him.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.880]   I think it was Jason Calicanis who told me that--
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.200]   you got to understand that when you're an actor,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.880]   you got a lot of free time.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.520]   You know, there's a lot of time between movies.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.480]   And if you're not working a lot, there's a lot of free time.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.920]   They're made for Twitter.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.880]   They're made for Twitter.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.360]   This is-- this is-- Twitter is the thing you do when you don't
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.960]   have other things to do, right?
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.360]   In fact, I even find my Twitter usage spikes.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.640]   You know, when I'm standing-- in fact, I used to tweet a lot
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.480]   when I was standing around in the television set,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.280]   waiting for the next shot.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.320]   That's when you tweet.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.720]   Well, I think it's one of those jobs that's not exactly 9 to 5.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.120]   It's not that you've got a lot of free time,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.520]   but you've got these huge segments of time between shoots
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.920]   and things or between various projects.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   Precisely.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.800]   And then suddenly he has this period.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.160]   I mean, he was marketing a movie.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.920]   It was like a couple of months ago.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.760]   He had--
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.680]   It's spread.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.600]   And then he has this period of high activity
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.960]   where he's got to push it through his Twitter feed
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.280]   and go into interviews.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.600]   And then it kind of comes down a little bit
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.800]   and he's back to his tweet.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.240]   So to get back to this "New York Times" story,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.320]   they're talking about how companies are using Twitter
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.160]   to respond.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.560]   And this has been very effective for Comcast initially
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.040]   enough for other companies.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.320]   Best Buy has done some amazing things.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.800]   Well, Best Buy has what they call the 12th force.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.760]   Now that is the worst word.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.440]   They have-- I've-- well, I visited them,
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.640]   and they were a bit sheepish about it.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.040]   They were trying to come up with something cute,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.360]   and that's what they landed on.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.200]   And it was too late.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.120]   It was done.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.040]   It's too late.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.240]   It's gone viral.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.360]   We're the 12th force.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.120]   But they put it on every commercial now.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.720]   And there's 2,500 people on this 12th force.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.600]   There went my number of the week out the window.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.120]   Oh, shoot.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.600]   I got to just not say numbers.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.640]   I'll edit that out.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.840]   But that is phenomenal.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.360]   Why?
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.480]   I wonder how many people they could possibly have,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.760]   maybe five or six, right?
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.480]   I mean, Comcast Cares was just Frank Elias.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.720]   But this is different.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.800]   This is really smart because it mobilizes the entire employee
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.480]   force.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.360]   So if somebody has a question, the Times
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.880]   thinks that a woman had a question about setting up her GPS,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.360]   and she got two answers like that.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:18.480]   I think there was a book called "Gonzo Marketing"
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   by Chris Locke, one of the authors of "Clutrain."
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.200]   And he proposed this long ago.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.560]   This is why every employee should blog.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.480]   Right.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.560]   It didn't quite work out that way,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.320]   because blogging was just too much of an effort.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.640]   And I think it's also this idea of the post-media world
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.240]   that Twitter comes to you.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.520]   You don't have to go to it.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.760]   You force the media company, which is best
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.720]   by in this case, to come to you and solve your problem.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.600]   I love that, right?
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.120]   Sure.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.400]   If they respond.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.240]   Does it scale?
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.160]   No.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.880]   Well, it's double scaling, isn't it?
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.000]   They've got 2,500.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.040]   We're number of the week.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.560]   No, no, no.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   And they have--
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.160]   I was trying to save it.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.360]   And they have customers just put a question,
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.200]   and one of those 2,500 is going to answer it.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.920]   It's that commercial they have of the people answering
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.080]   questions in the football field.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   Right.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   Right.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.400]   Well, I think it's very interesting to watch it happen.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.280]   And I'm with you, Pete.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.360]   This is unexpected out of the blue,
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.440]   and who knows what it means.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.240]   Well, one thing it means is that that's marketing money
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.720]   that best by doesn't have to spend.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.640]   Yes.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.680]   And Dell and all these companies.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.200]   Right?
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.360]   It's customer service money and especially marketing money,
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.640]   because they can get their message out directly
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.240]   to the customers around media, far more efficient,
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.440]   far more targeted.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.200]   It lives up to the Cloutine Promise,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.360]   which is that markets are conversations.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:35.800]   Amen.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.280]   And if you want to market what you do,
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.920]   you have to have genuine conversations
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.000]   with your customers.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.720]   With real people.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.280]   With real people.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.600]   And we just didn't have the technology.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.040]   How are you going to do that before Twitter?
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.840]   Now we have this perfect method to do it.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   I hope that I hope this not be us.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.040]   I want to put Pete on the spot, because he's
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.480]   got over a million followers.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.960]   Kind of going back to the scaling question.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.840]   Pete, do you feel like you have time to reply to everyone
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.480]   who replies to you on Twitter with as many followers as you have?
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.160]   No.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.640]   I don't wish--
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.480]   That is the challenge.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.120]   I mean, I used to.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.040]   And then increasingly, one of the things about that
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.640]   is that you kind of--
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.000]   the more people who are following you,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.920]   the more you feel like you have to put out things
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   with really high value.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.320]   And it becomes a lot less conversational.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   And I'm kind of tempted to set up a second account
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.200]   and just use that for the conversational stuff,
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.720]   because otherwise it gets really noisy.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.960]   I think to Jeff's point, a lot of people
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.840]   who think it won't scale don't understand
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.560]   that this isn't making your customer service bigger.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.960]   It can come out of the marketing portion.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.320]   I am a bit concerned, though, because we
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.880]   had this wonderful period at the start of Twitter,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.400]   where you could just mention any company that instantly finds
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.560]   you.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.880]   And I think if Twitter does become mainstream
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.600]   and best buy has thousands or tens of thousands of people
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.680]   mentioning best buy every day, this is going to be challenging.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.760]   Well, scale's a lot of people.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.280]   They're going to see--
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.000]   You have the 2,500 number of the week employees in there who--
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   that's what scales.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.080]   You have to go up on both sides, right?
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.840]   You answered everybody doesn't work.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.800]   But if you had 2,500 use answering the questions,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.880]   that starts to scale, I think.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.800]   You just don't have enough people at Mashable
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.960]   answering questions.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.880]   Yeah, I need to expand--
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.360]   I need to expand our marketing budget a little bit, I think,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.240]   or our customer service budget or a bug.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.440]   Well, but that's kind of the point of this, though,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.600]   is that it's guerrilla marketing.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.600]   It shouldn't really have to--
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.920]   I guess it does cost money, huh?
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.800]   Well, in the long--
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.280]   One of the challenges with Twitter
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.840]   is that it feels inauthentic if it's not
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.080]   you replying directly.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   Right.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:40.600]   No, I--
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   You should be--
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   You should be--
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.040]   You should be on the spot.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.000]   Well, I think it's a--
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.960]   I didn't tell if you need to be on the spot.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.800]   Go ahead, Leo, sorry.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   That's a legitimate question.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.000]   I mean, how do you handle that?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.720]   Now, Pete, you got to a million again,
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.880]   because of the suggested user list.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.560]   I don't think anybody really can get to a million
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.240]   without being picked by Twitter, anointed by Twitter.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.160]   Insert Dave Weiner rant here.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.640]   Probably so, I think.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.360]   I think it's the case.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.120]   If you look at--
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.400]   I don't think there's anybody over a million
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.680]   that isn't on the SQL or wasn't at some point.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.400]   Did you notice increased engagement when you got to that
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:13.720]   million?
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.280]   Was it significantly more engagement?
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.560]   Um, well, I mean, I think--
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:27.440]   I think the engagement is obviously--
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.320]   that audience you're attracting is a more broad general audience,
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.640]   so you're not going to keep quite the same percentage
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.080]   as the one-to-one connections you were making in the early days.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.280]   Um, so obviously engagement is going to fall as you scale,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.320]   as a-- as a kind of a relative, but as an absolute,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.680]   it obviously increases.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.560]   It does go up, right?
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.760]   And you know, the thing about blog traffic as well as
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.520]   that Twitter is referring a lot of traffic that's very,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.280]   very engaged.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.720]   They're far, far more likely to leave a comment
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.480]   or to share something or to rate something.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.000]   Any kind of interaction.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.560]   I think that's interesting.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   So you do notice that.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.360]   Yeah, I think comment counts on blogs
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.920]   increased a huge amount with Twitter,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.280]   because it just kind of lowered the barrier to engaging
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.240]   and made--
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.200]   you know, it switched the broadcast model around a little bit
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.120]   for blogs, so people were so used to engaging and replying.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.080]   That I think comment counts certainly increased
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.440]   with Twitter, springing out.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.200]   Well, that's a value.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.320]   That's a real value.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.600]   And you know, with dig, people would
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.240]   make the comments about your story on dig.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.560]   But with Twitter, I mean, people can respond on Twitter,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.800]   but if they click on your link, they're
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.560]   going to respond on your site, which is nice.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.160]   Right.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.640]   Exactly.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.920]   Let's talk about Rupert Murdoch.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.360]   We love Rupert Murdoch.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.800]   It's a wonderful, wonderful guy.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.080]   May I do a dramatic reading, Leo?
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.800]   Yes, would you please?
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.640]   So this is from Sam Guston at AOL's Daily Finance,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.960]   how the Grinch stole Google News.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.560]   Every hoo down in Hooville liked Google a lot.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.800]   But the Grinch, who lived up in a penthouse, did not.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.080]   The Grinch hated Google.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.880]   Didn't find Google pleasing.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.160]   Now please don't ask why.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.480]   No one quite knows the reason.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.240]   It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.080]   It could be perhaps that his views were too tight.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.000]   But I think that the most likely reason of all
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.280]   may have been that his heart was two sizes, two small.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.920]   Now we know who Dr. Seuss was talking about.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.240]   It goes on and on and on.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.040]   It's quite amazing.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.680]   Rupert the Grinch Murdoch.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.680]   Wow.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.720]   So did the Grinch steal Google?
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.120]   Remember Jason Calicanis' supposition
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.160]   that maybe he was about to do a deal with Microsoft?
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   Now there are rumors.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.400]   I wonder.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.360]   Do you know how accurate these rumors are
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:45.880]   that the news corp is negotiating with Microsoft?
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.600]   I hit this week where FDFT, Financial Times, had the story.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.160]   And I got--
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.360]   Rupert Murdoch's own journal.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:52.960]   No, no, no.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.080]   That's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:54.640]   How dare you leave?
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.880]   We don't own FT.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.800]   I thought I own the FT.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.160]   OK.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.920]   No, not the journal.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.080]   And I got press inquiries like mad.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.240]   And somebody tweeted that it's ironic for Jarvis's
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.720]   against repetitive commodity news,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.640]   is making repetitive commodity performances over it,
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.200]   which I was.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.160]   That's how it works.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:09.960]   That's how you do it.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.840]   Twice ABC Australia NPR twice Canadian paper.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.720]   It was kind of ridiculous.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.600]   But there was enough of a report of this
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.680]   that everybody started, in turn, repeating it.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.280]   And it became the ridiculous story of the week.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.880]   I still think--
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.360]   consider that Murdoch has a $300 million deal per year.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.960]   He's trying to figure out what to do with Wyspace.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   I think it is chest thumping macho bluster.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.400]   But there's a danger here.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.160]   There's a real danger here that this meme will take off.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.560]   And I'm hearing people say, well, why not?
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.160]   And we see a bifurcation, a balkanization of the web
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.000]   coming, which I think could be horrible.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   I agree.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.920]   I mean, search results have to be agnostic.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.520]   Pete, you agree?
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.160]   Is this a--
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.880]   I mean, I think I could see Rupert trying to do it.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.360]   Pete wrote a great post about this that
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.440]   went into great detail about why stupid it is, right Pete?
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.280]   Yeah, we're at a piece on CNN this week
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.200]   about just how the consumer loses essentially.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.600]   I think once you have this situation where
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.120]   media companies are of the opinion
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.360]   that they can start selling distribution essentially
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.560]   on an exclusive basis on the web,
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.680]   you put the challenge where you kind of opening up
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.920]   the ability to have to switch from Bing to Google
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:38.240]   or remember what's on which site or which search engine.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.000]   And I just think it's an incredibly anti-user.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.040]   And I think it's really just Murdoch
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.220]   trying to seize back control in the sense of he
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.520]   used to be able to go into a market and go into printing
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.680]   presses and go into the trucks.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.080]   And he could buy out the rival paper.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.200]   And it was all about domination and control and power.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.080]   And now influence is a lot more--
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.640]   two ways, not more interactive.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.600]   And it's essentially that whole piece of giving the consumer
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.080]   control.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.200]   And that's what's happening now.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.120]   We can go to Google and we can find his paper.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.040]   We can find anyone else's paper.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   And I don't think he likes that.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.200]   I don't think he's a fan of the consumer suddenly
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.720]   being in control of the entire experience.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.680]   And he's trying to steal back some of that control
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.560]   and say, no, you have to pay.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.920]   If you're not going to pay, things
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.640]   going to pay and you're going to go there.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.480]   What's wrong with that?
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.960]   He's trying to make a living.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.280]   It would be because it's not going
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.600]   to be the best way to make the most money.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.840]   He's going to be cut down where he loses discovery.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.760]   He loses audience.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.840]   He loses advertising revenue.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.520]   He increases marketing cost markedly.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.240]   And it's just not going to be there.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.320]   It's emotions speaking.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.480]   It's entitlement speaking.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.280]   It's not hard economics.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.600]   But I think Pete's absolutely right.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.440]   This age is about heading over control.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.760]   And that's the last thing that Murdoch and Microsoft
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.640]   each want to do.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.440]   That's not the way they think.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.800]   They don't see the way to take advantage of and exploit
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.880]   that loss of control as a good.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.720]   And so what happens is that we have walls going up.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.320]   The walls used to control and contain the value.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.440]   Now walls diminish the value.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.400]   And that's what they don't understand.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.080]   Do you think that the regular user, the regular web
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.720]   searcher is actually going--
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.880]   if this came to pass, do you think someone's
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.800]   going to know enough to switch to Bing in order
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.520]   to get these news stories?
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.640]   I mean, I was thinking I absolutely agree with Pete
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.520]   and his CNN piece was great.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.800]   When I was at Life Hacker, there would
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.240]   be all these kind of spam blogs that would just pull our content,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.760]   wholesale, and republish it.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.640]   And I imagine that happens with a lot of the news sites as well.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.920]   So I think that regular consumers will just go to Google,
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.840]   continue to use Google, and get the news stories
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.360]   from these other sites that are sort of syndicating them
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.960]   or blogs that are commenting them and excerpting them.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.560]   And so then those other sites get the traffic.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.760]   They lose money, maybe make money from the deal from Microsoft,
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.480]   but become a lesser element over time.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.760]   I mean, it just seems like they're just
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   kind of shooting themselves in the foot.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.760]   And I just don't see anyone except for bloggers
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.320]   or professional researchers really knowing enough to switch
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.560]   engines and know who has access to what content.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.800]   I think you're absolutely right, Gina.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.160]   And it's about--
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.360]   I wrote a post to this week saying that Murdoch has balls.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.280]   I hope we can say that on your air, Leo.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.440]   You certainly can.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.320]   Because he's always made huge bets, right?
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.520]   He made some bad bets.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.240]   He almost lost his company at one point,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.560]   MySpace, Satellite in the US.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.600]   But he made huge bets that won sports and Fox News
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.200]   and other things like that.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.040]   What's sad about this is it's not a huge bet.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.520]   James Murdoch has said that News Corp is no longer a news
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:36.880]   company.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.280]   It's a TV company.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.440]   And I think we kind of see the last milking of this thing.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.600]   So I have people--
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.480]   I respect who've been saying online, well,
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.000]   Jarvis, celebrate this.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.360]   Murdoch will get fewer people.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.440]   And that's great.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.480]   And I said, no, I don't want anybody to be setting up
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:52.960]   these walls.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.040]   I think it's evil of Microsoft to be tempting old man
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.480]   Murdoch to do this.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.880]   And what's going to happen in the end is, yes, it may well
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.600]   kill News Corp faster, but it's going to do, as Pete says,
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.640]   more damage than just that.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.680]   I think to Gina's point is this assumption that there's
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.160]   going to be this huge hole.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.480]   There's going to be a void.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.080]   You're going to miss us because we're not
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.600]   going to have our content now.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.880]   You know, I search for Wall Street Journal articles
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   on Google and I get the Huffington Post.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.920]   Now, that's not a spam blog.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.600]   It's not these, I think, what did he call them, content
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.200]   Klebsmania actually.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.680]   It's like a maniac.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.120]   Who are literally stealing in-hole this content.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.600]   But there's a lot of country.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.480]   You know, if they're having the Post goes and comments
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.680]   on Wall Street Journal article, they're going to quote
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.280]   the relevant piece anyway.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.000]   I'm going to get the gist of it.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.440]   I don't need to head over to Bing to find the original.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.920]   And I think even though the original might get lost over
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.800]   on Bing, there's going to be enough commentary around it
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.280]   to get the gist of the story anyway.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.720]   And the other thing about it is you're right.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.200]   The information itself is a commodity.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.600]   I put up on the friend feed earlier a demonstration
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.920]   from Microsoft's Labs on Pivot.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.120]   And the scientist who was doing it was,
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   name I suddenly forget, quoted Frank Zappa.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.600]   I'm going to get this wrong, but saying something
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.840]   in fact that information is not knowledge
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   and knowledge is not wisdom.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.040]   And the thing about news is that it's just information.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.800]   It just becomes commodity information.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.160]   The fact that Tiger Woods ran into a fire hydrant
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.600]   and his wife used God bless her, a golf club,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.640]   to get him out.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.600]   We all do instantly and really hard to imagine anyone making
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.960]   anything special about that because everybody has the same joke.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.360]   It's a real commodity.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.200]   It is a commodity, but by the same token,
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.080]   the person who breaks it, you link to them.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.920]   That's how you express the value that, OK, this person
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   broke the story.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.080]   And you're going to get less links if your content is less
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:46.560]   findable.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.600]   It's just the way it happens.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.960]   So you can't let us do that expression of value and say,
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.400]   hey, we found the little street journal.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.160]   You're kind of cutting off the Google juice
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.920]   that will go to you, I guess.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.960]   Although I think there is still room for scoops.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.080]   I mean, I'm seeing a lot on Princess TMZ
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.480]   today of the coverage of that Tiger Woods story.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.880]   I think there's certainly value in that.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.840]   And if that was the kind of thing we were writing about,
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.280]   we'd be crediting them for at least leading the conversation.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.640]   So I think there is something to having a scoop
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.360]   and to having speed, but it gets commoditized incredibly fast
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.080]   by things like Twitter.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.800]   And you really need to be in there fast.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.080]   Pete, I think it's even more than that.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.640]   I think it's an ethic of the link that you have to link
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.240]   to the journals of it at source.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.080]   I yammer on about the link economy all the time.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.160]   And the key thing is that he or she who gets the links
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.480]   has to monetize them.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.800]   And so if the Washington Post or TMZ or whoever
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.720]   is doing the story, the right thing
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.440]   to do for your reader and for them both
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.800]   is to link to it at its source, not at the 10th pale copy
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.840]   image.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.000]   Hard to train users to do that.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.560]   But when you search for this new story--
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.360]   yeah, but when you search for the new story
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.160]   and you get Huffington Post's first result,
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.080]   you read the Huffington Post article,
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.280]   it's going to have a link to the original source anyway.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   I mean, you might be less likely--
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:02.720]   I don't know.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.040]   I think an experienced blogger is
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.200]   going to put that via link in anyway,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.360]   even if it's not the first result in the initial search.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.800]   I would hope so.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.080]   But I think that that's not the case a lot of the times.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.920]   What is an experienced blogger anyway?
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.440]   Who would that be?
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.080]   Well, someone who cares about getting credit--
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   You and T.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.160]   No, Mashable is great.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.520]   Well, yeah, Mashable is so--
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.720]   and so great because they give credit where credit is due.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.080]   We try to do the same thing at Life Hacker.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   So you think in the long run--
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.480]   Try to do the right thing.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.360]   Yeah, you do the right thing you gain by that.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.400]   Yes.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.480]   I think everybody gains.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.440]   The ecosystem gains.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.040]   And it becomes a golden rule of the internet.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.840]   If you want links, good links, you give good links.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.880]   Somebody's got to tell people that.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.880]   We do hear every day and week.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880]   And they're not listening.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.000]   They're not listening, especially on Twitter.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.720]   I want to take a little break and come back.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.640]   We're going to talk about Google's doing an interesting
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.560]   thing with the Iraqi Museum.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.320]   There is a new Google interface, which
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.640]   with a little bit of JavaScript messing around,
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.960]   you can turn on for yourself.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.160]   Snoopy and Woodstock for Thanksgiving.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.280]   And the offensive image of Michelle Obama that Google
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   had to deal with in some way and found a way to do with it.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.960]   Before we talk about all that, though, I
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   do want to talk about our friends at Citrix, the folks
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.760]   who do the Go to Meeting product that we use all the time
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.160]   around here for our meetings.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.520]   A meeting without visuals nowadays is just really a phone
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.040]   call.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.920]   And it's not very effective.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.840]   And yet, flying across country or driving across town
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.880]   for a meeting isn't very cost effective.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.200]   So this is why I want to set you up with something called
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.640]   Go to Meeting.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.080]   You've probably heard me talk about it before.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.440]   Now you could try it for free for 30 days by just going to,
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.840]   go to meeting, gotom meeting.com/twig.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.120]   When you get there, you'll be able to sign up
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.160]   for a 30-day free trial of this incredible meeting software.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.040]   I love Go to Meeting.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.160]   I know you're going to love it too.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.920]   That's why I'm telling everybody I know to give it a shot.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:18.520]   G-O-T-O Meeting.com/twig.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.040]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.120]   And I invite you to take a look at Go to Meeting.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.400]   So the Google cartoon, you probably didn't see it, Gina.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.600]   And I know you didn't see it, Pete,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.480]   because you were overseas.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.760]   But Mashable did report on it.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.080]   I did.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.520]   I got our US that it's just a summer screen show
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.280]   out of the weekend.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.640]   So that was really cute.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.920]   It was snoopy and making Thanksgiving.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.160]   I like that.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.480]   I thought that was quite nifty.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.400]   I wonder whether they got the rights or that was kleptomania.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.760]   It's got Schulz's signature.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.880]   So I have a feeling there was some permissions involved.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.920]   I would bet there was.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.280]   I wonder if there was money.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.040]   It's fantastic, Mark, saying how much is that worth?
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.280]   No kidding.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:03.800]   No kidding.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.880]   When you're feeling killed to have done that.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.400]   Well, and of course--
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.240]   Take it all the attention.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.760]   And then, of course, the geeks are immediately tweeting
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.040]   when the-- it's Peanuts Thanksgiving special comes on.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.080]   Geeks like presents.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.640]   With on this show, you guys were talking about how overkill
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.880]   they went with the Sesame Street stuff.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.720]   Yes.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.280]   It's like four--
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   It's like four--
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.760]   --for weeks of that.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.280]   It seems like--
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.280]   I have no idea how they set up.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.320]   Because sometimes I hear you guys speaking about these things
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:32.960]   and I see them.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.360]   And sometimes I don't in the UK.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.040]   So it seems to vary wildly, depending on what we can see
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.040]   and what we can see.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.200]   Can you not go to the US Google?
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.360]   No, I use the no-country redirect.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.520]   It just depends on your IP, I think.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   So I know--
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   I know what it's going to be.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.920]   It'll look at your IP.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.880]   But I seem to remember, even when I was in France,
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.120]   I could say no, I want to go to the US Google.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.480]   Yeah, you use /ncr, which is no-country redirect.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.440]   OK.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.360]   And then you could choose which one you want.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   Have you seen this new Google look?
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.280]   There's a little JavaScript clip you could put in here.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.920]   Let me give credit to the people who do it.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.040]   And when you do a search--
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:20.560]   I don't like it.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.160]   It's very Windows XP looking.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.880]   But when you do a search as this new sidebar,
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.920]   that gives you everything, images, video, blogs.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.200]   And then there's a more button that you can see--
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.000]   So instead of this more drop down here,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.120]   they've got this on the side.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.160]   This does approach our version of criminal analogy, doesn't it?
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.000]   Well, yes.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.800]   This is criminal analogy.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.760]   Who is making this?
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.320]   And why?
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.720]   Is there a change in the bullet poodle?
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.680]   I don't know.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.200]   Google tries a lot of stuff, though, don't they?
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.400]   I mean, there was experimenting.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.240]   I kind of prefer the One Box strategy, which essentially
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.880]   figures out what you mean to search for and doesn't
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.080]   have to give you the options because it can pretty much
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.640]   figure out that if you're searching for the title of the song,
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.440]   you're probably looking for music.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.880]   That's kind of more options than I need most of the time.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.360]   That whole sidebar thing.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.960]   Yeah, I'm very bingish.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.640]   And I think it's still a response to Bing, frankly.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   Yeah, I think they're trying to--
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.680]   the challenge they face is that it's this One Box,
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.520]   and if you don't know what Google can do,
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.120]   most people aren't experimenting
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.360]   with all these other options.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.680]   But I really doubt that one will get pushed through
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.360]   to be the final-- to be live on everyone's perspective.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.720]   Because I think One Box is just so much more elegant.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.480]   You don't need the options most of the time.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.800]   Credit to the Google Blog-A-Scoped for finding this.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.960]   It is like criminology.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.760]   You're exactly right.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.680]   I don't know how you would even find this.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.960]   The Box is now blue.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.200]   What does that mean for the universe?
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.920]   Blue, it's blue.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.240]   And I think what it's doing is it's changing your cookies.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.280]   You have to log out of your Google account,
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   run this JavaScript, which sets a new cookie.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   And then I was able to log back in.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.200]   I guess my Google is now forever changed.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.360]   I don't know.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.760]   I don't know if that's a good thing or not.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   I can delete that cookie.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.040]   Set the preference cookie.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   Yeah, go find the cookie.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.360]   It's a obscure cookie.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.160]   Yeah, it's a preference.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.680]   Preference equals ID equals--
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.280]   and it's a long, long thing.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.680]   Google, let's talk a little bit about Wave.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.520]   I know we've talked about Gina's doing her complete guide
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.120]   to Google Wave.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.280]   Let's give you a little plug, Gina.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.920]   CompleteWaveGuide.com.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.720]   You can get the preview PDF right now.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.160]   And--
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.680]   Yes.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.360]   Yes.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:36.880]   Leah Bettany.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.600]   That went on sale a couple weeks ago.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.100]   Yay.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.240]   At Web 2.0 Expo, yeah.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.880]   Selling well?
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.280]   It is selling well.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.040]   I'm really happy.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.720]   Not like Oprah Club well, but certainly
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.600]   well for something that's in preview and invitation only.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.520]   And so, yeah, I'm really happy thanks to everyone
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.960]   who's listening here who bought a copy.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.280]   Well, we've got to get Oprah to plug it.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.800]   Now that she's on Twitter--
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.560]   I don't think Oprah is going to.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.800]   She just did like this skateboarding bulldog on YouTube
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.520]   a few months ago.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.080]   She just discovered YouTube.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.920]   I don't think she's going to make it by the time her show ends.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   As soon as she covers that book, it's
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   jumped the shark away.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.920]   It's just amazing.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.440]   It's amazing.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:13.920]   It's amazing.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.440]   It's amazing.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:14.920]   It's going to--
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.280]   Oh, Oprah's on Wave now.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.040]   Oh, how exciting.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.400]   Leah Bettany's on it.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.160]   We know it's done.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:21.680]   Yeah, really.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.160]   Leah Bettany Court wrote an excellent piece in Mashable
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.760]   this week about mainstream media using Wave, something
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.640]   we haven't really successfully achieved.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.720]   What do you think of this?
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.160]   I mean, the Chicago Tribune's Red Eye blog
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.760]   has a public wave that started November 10.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.120]   The problem with we do this is it just gets--
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.680]   we get overwhelmed.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.720]   I'm impressed, actually, by--
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.280]   I see Leah writing these posts.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.680]   And I've seen on Mashable their use of Twitter lists as well.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.360]   We like to cover how is the mainstream media using this stuff.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:56.880]   And you know what?
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.400]   Give them that credit, because they're actually
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.720]   heading on a lot of this stuff.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   You know, the bloggers haven't rolled out
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.680]   Google Wave implementations yet.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.920]   We haven't found the point at which it works for us.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.520]   And like you say, we'll get bombarded,
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.440]   because we have so many active users
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.560]   that we don't set it up, right?
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.840]   But, you know, credit works.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.520]   You get that thing from--
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.000]   I think we're away.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.720]   We bloggers are more loners.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.360]   This is about collaboration in teams,
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.880]   and that's what newsrooms are.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.360]   And they're stuck in their CMSs in ways
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.320]   that they find restricting where we find ours liberating.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.000]   Good point.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.840]   That's a good point.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.520]   So people will create something new in some new way.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.920]   Now, is it yet possible that I can publish something
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.560]   from a Wave to a web page?
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.560]   Yes, you can.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.120]   But the only people who can see it
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.320]   are the people who have Wave and are signed it, right?
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.280]   Which limits your audience kind of straight away.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.360]   And everybody in the public square is ruined,
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.480]   or you have just too few.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.400]   I think that's-- once that changes,
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.040]   we're going to see a huge difference here.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.240]   In a lot of us, the news business went wacko,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.800]   not nearly as much as Gina, but when wacko on Wave,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.520]   because of the implications it has for news.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.760]   I think it's all about potential.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.120]   I mean, I talked about this in my Web 2.0 talk.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.080]   I mean, I think that Wave's best uses
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.440]   are when you have a small group of people,
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.200]   six to two people collaborating on a single Wave.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.480]   I mean, I think public Waves get out of control really quickly.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.920]   And at this early stage, they turn
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.360]   into discussions of how to use Wave, honestly,
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.040]   because people aren't used to it yet.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.840]   But Gina, if you could use that group of 12
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   to publish something that a group of a million can see
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.360]   and to advantage on, that's really the kind of the ideal,
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.120]   isn't it?
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.040]   Yes, and that is the ideal.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.640]   But right now, there's no easy way
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.920]   to kind of export a completed Wave without the inline comments
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.440]   or to publish it.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.160]   Or really, what you'd want to do is
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.320]   be able to easily export it to HTML or Word
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   or some things that you could publish read only.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.640]   The thing is, you can't set a Wave to be read only
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.440]   and you can't say, let everyone in the world,
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.200]   whether or not they're signed into Wave yet.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.440]   But that's coming.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.600]   That's been promised.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.720]   I think that there's a lot of potential.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.680]   And I think-- I had to admit, I think
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.800]   that we all kind of fell in love with the potential
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.760]   of Wave right versus what the preview is at the moment.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.960]   We're using Wave internally at Twit to plan our CES stuff.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.960]   And Kiki Sanford set that up.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.320]   And that's working quite well.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.960]   But it's a small group of seven people.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.560]   There are a lot of twig waves.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.240]   But good luck at following them or using them or anything
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.840]   like that, because it's overwhelming.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.760]   Yeah, they get to--
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.520]   They get to have control.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.160]   You know what?
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.520]   The Wave folks did a user feedback survey
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.880]   where they asked users, what do you like about Wave
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.280]   the most and what don't you like about Wave the most?
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.800]   And people said that they love the idea of having one place
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.120]   where you could get everything, a central place for everything.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.480]   That's what they like the most.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.400]   And then one of the things that they didn't like the most
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   is that there's no integration for existing tools, like email
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.640]   and IAM, although there are bots that can do some of my stuff
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.000]   right now.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.760]   So there's a thin lawn, which you love and hate.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.320]   The very thing that they like the most
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.840]   is kind of the issue, the thing that they don't like right now
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.480]   on the preview.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.040]   So Wave is--
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.520]   So we have a comment on the inbox, just on my extent.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.320]   Yeah, I think--
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.840]   Which is like another place to go and check.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.320]   And out of control inbox.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.400]   And inbox, it seems to sprout tendrils every minute.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.080]   Yeah, it does definitely create another inbox problem.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.600]   And none of us need another inbox.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.160]   And that definitely is a problem.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.840]   So how do you recommend managing it?
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.240]   Because I'm just looking at my all.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.080]   And it's just a lot.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.000]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.920]   You go through and unfollow a bunch of stuff.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.240]   It does clean it up a little bit.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.680]   I think it's getting--
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.280]   they turned off that public wave thing.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.760]   Remember when you searched for public wave,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.120]   I think you guys mentioned this.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.360]   You just ended up with noise.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.760]   Right.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.280]   With following all these waves.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.960]   So if I see this in this wave--
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:55.440]   It's easy to control.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.560]   That says, who likes Lego?
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.360]   I'm really not interested in following that.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.600]   I could just unfollow that by pressing the unfollow button.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   The unfollow button, yeah.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.760]   The unfollow button is just--
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   It's the mute, isn't it?
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.560]   It's just-- they just changed.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.000]   It looks like mute.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's got a speaker with a line through it.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.800]   Yeah, I think they changed it because it's kind of more
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.680]   into-- in keeping with the whole Twitter nomenclature.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.720]   Right.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.280]   Well, one good thing, we all got more invitations this week.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.120]   Oh.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.560]   Oh.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.640]   Oh, I got some news.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.880]   You guys didn't know.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.880]   Popularity.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.760]   I moved my invitation.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.160]   Go ahead.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.480]   Try to find-- I'll wait.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.680]   Try to find the invite others to Google Wave.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.920]   I moved mine, fortunately, at the beginning to documentation.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.080]   So I can go right to it.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.400]   And I noticed some waves of invites going out.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.680]   And I think I got another 10, something like that.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.720]   So check how many wave invites you've got.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.840]   How many people aren't on it now, though, out of the audience?
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.920]   I think everybody has it, right?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   Isn't it kind of evening out?
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.720]   We went through that stage of really wanting it.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.240]   And then we got there and we wondered why we wanted it so
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.840]   desperately because we don't get it.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.480]   But it was the same process with Twitter.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:09.480]   So let's not assume that means that it doesn't have value.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.640]   It's just that the use cases haven't quite emerged because it's
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.040]   so open and there's so many possibilities
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.200]   that there isn't really a clear signal on which of these
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.920]   is going to pan out to be the most effective for us
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.960]   as a publisher or as individuals or in terms of collaboration.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.160]   It was the same with Twitter.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.760]   We kicked the tires and then we left it alone for a couple of months.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.680]   I can't assess that wave will arrive when you don't know what's
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.760]   there, what's weight inside.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.920]   Twitter's beauty is a simplicity that even the TV weathermen
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.160]   can figure it out.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.320]   Right?
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.240]   That's why it's spread.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.920]   That's why your media point was absolutely right,
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.160]   is that it drives traffic to them and they get that.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.920]   No one is ever going to use this level.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:58.560]   But when Gina and her troops make applications on top of it,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.080]   that's when waves are going to take off, I think.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.280]   So do you think that waves can ever be a consumer-facing thing
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.960]   or is it because RSS was never big with consumers?
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.360]   I mean, what's great about Twitter
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:13.480]   is that it's basically that follow method for the general
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.120]   populace and RSS never really got to that stage.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.920]   It's still a little bit geeky.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.160]   I think that the mainstream still aren't booting up there,
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.120]   learning up their RSS reader.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.440]   Do you think that wave will ever be a consumer-facing app?
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:29.080]   Or is it just going to be pipes like RSS?
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.800]   I think it's more of a platform and pipes
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:38.240]   and that applications will use it more than RSS inside.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:43.040]   I can see sales force using it in amazing ways, for example.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:46.960]   But I just don't see wave as wave becoming a consumer
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   application.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.560]   What do you think?
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.600]   I think that would be a shame.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.480]   I think that would be a terrible shame if it doesn't happen.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.560]   But I can see your point because Google has not
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:59:00.480]   got a good track record in building really nice consumer-facing
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.040]   social applications.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.400]   It's just--
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.400]   But isn't that the beauty of a beat?
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.360]   It's just not something they do.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.360]   It's just not something they do.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:06.800]   Right?
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.720]   The people who read you and Gina can
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.200]   build the killer amazing uses of wave, a top wave.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:13.920]   That's what I hope for.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   Sure.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.960]   I think one of the things about having a consumer-facing app
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.360]   is really great marketing.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.640]   I mean, you mentioned Ashton and Oprah getting on board.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.240]   That's fantastic for user adoption.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.040]   And then the more users you have, the more value the network has.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:37.040]   So I guess you're not going to need to--
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.360]   at some point, you're not going to need to have waves to use wave.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.960]   And I guess at that point, the network effect argument
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.400]   is irrelevant.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.440]   But I would like it to be a consumer-facing app.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.400]   I think there's a lot of advantages to that.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.560]   What would it take to be that?
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.520]   I would like--
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.720]   Gina, go ahead.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.400]   You know, I just--
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.120]   I would like for it to be a consumer-facing app, too.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.680]   But I think, you know, at first, it's--
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.360]   you know, it's a power tool for power users.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.320]   I mean, I think that it takes a certain kind of savvy user.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.680]   I was talking to someone, a guy from MindTouch,
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   which is this wiki company.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.880]   And he was-- they forked Media Wiki, which runs Wikipedia.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.080]   And they said to the Wikipedia people,
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.200]   we want to make it easier to edit pages.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.680]   We don't want people to have to learn Wiki markup.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.520]   And the Wikipedia people said-- and I hope I'm not misputting--
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.880]   but they basically said, well, that barrier kind of--
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880]   We liked that.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.720]   --pieces of our a little bit.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.040]   And only people who are really serious and committed
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.120]   are going to edit the pages.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.440]   And certainly, I think that applications
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.480]   should be usable.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.120]   But there's a learning curve with Wave.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.920]   It's not something we learn in afternoon.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.400]   It's pretty unapologetic about the fact
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.920]   that it takes a little bit of commitment.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.400]   It takes a little learning to get to use,
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.760]   to get the value out of it.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.880]   I don't think that's a bad thing.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.200]   And I think that for people who write and collaborate
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.280]   and process information all day long,
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.680]   knowledge workers, that Wave is going to spread
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.440]   because someone in the work group has caught the religion
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.880]   and realized how great it is.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.360]   And we'll bring in their coworkers
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.280]   and bite them into Wave.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.200]   And they'll see how useful it is.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.480]   I mean, our Oprah and Ashton ever going to be on Wave?
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.600]   I'll say no.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.040]   And I'm happy about that.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.960]   And that can make me sound like a really strong--
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.200]   Which Twitter were a lot harder to use, to be honest.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.000]   If it only were harder to use.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.520]   I mean, I think there's a place for both, right?
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.880]   Like, my web channel speech, I was saying that Photoshop--
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.480]   no one expects to sit down Photoshop
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.400]   and learn it in afternoon.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.480]   It's an advanced tool for power users.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.920]   And I think I don't think Wave is as complicated as Photoshop.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.000]   But it is an advanced tool.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.360]   And it takes a little bit to learn.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.960]   And I think that to Jeff's point, the fact
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.720]   that it is a platform and that you can integrate apps with it
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.600]   via gadgets and bots will make it more interesting to people
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.040]   who want to see what it's like to Twitter via Wave
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.080]   or to watch YouTube videos via Wave or plan their vacation
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.480]   via Wave, however.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.920]   Those things will be hooks and will draw people in, I think.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.000]   And I think that what people really want is a central place.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   I think people are feeling like, my online life is fractured.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   It's everywhere.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.840]   I have to go to six, seven different web apps
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.200]   to get my stuff done.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.600]   And if Wave can realize its potential
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.760]   and put all those things in one interface,
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.120]   that that will be the huge for the kind of power users
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.520]   like us who live in the cloud and just want a single place
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.480]   to do everything.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.600]   Speaking of Wave.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.440]   I remember a company that when I worked for the new houses
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.040]   for cutting out, we almost invested it
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.520]   in Munich years ago called Twist.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.400]   It's long dead.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.120]   And thank God we didn't invest.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.320]   But they had this similar idea that you
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.600]   had a place where you could collaborate on things.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.000]   So you had the family shopping list
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.320]   and you could get it to it from your phone or from the web
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.440]   or from here or from there.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.000]   But there was that place where the collaboration happened.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.640]   And I always loved that model.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.040]   And it was way too soon.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.960]   But I think that there'll be some really simple consumer
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.640]   applications that take the best of Wave
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.440]   and make its use case obvious to a lot of people
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.120]   in certain cases.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120]   Do you know what?
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.560]   You've fantasized about this all bet.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.240]   But where do you think the first breakthrough use of Wave
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.360]   will be?
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.440]   I mean, for me, I think that at a very simple level
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.960]   for a regular person, something as simple as just
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.360]   taking meeting notes or avoiding those email threads
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.400]   where someone sends out email to people
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.720]   and asks a list of six questions
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.680]   and gets fractured responses from all different people,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.240]   just have this mess of an email thread.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.760]   I mean, I think that those are the very practical things
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.680]   that regular people in corporate jobs
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.480]   run into every single day or students sitting in a classroom
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.880]   and trying to take notes for the final from the professor
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.240]   who speaks too quickly and doing that together.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.080]   Crowdsourcing--
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.200]   Well, that's a great idea.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.760]   That's a great idea.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.280]   That's a really good idea.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.720]   Do you see it as a super-revel?
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.240]   You know, I think there was a really good example.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.760]   I don't know if you guys saw there was a conference that ran
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.200]   waves instead of hashtags.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.560]   I forget the name of the conference.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.040]   It was a couple weeks ago.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.440]   They started using Wave and people
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.080]   could do the commentary.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.800]   What was it, Jeff?
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.640]   Super-geeks?
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.280]   I was joking.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.480]   Super-geeks.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.200]   All 10 people who could use Wave got together
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.320]   and had a great time.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.640]   No, well, here's what they did.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.640]   They gave out Wave invites to start with so that everyone had it.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.400]   And then they took collaborative notes about the speakers
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.000]   and instead of each doing their own little tweets with the hashtag
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.040]   and them getting lost in Twitter,
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.840]   it was more like, let's create a Wave.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.920]   Let's have everyone edit this.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.880]   And at the end, they had really great summaries of,
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.520]   well, having at the conference, every single panel
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.880]   and speech was summarized.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.640]   And then they obviously had a wave where you could go and see them
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.320]   all listed.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.760]   And then they had a wave for feedback on what
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.120]   should we do better this year.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.560]   So I think that's a good use case.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.720]   And it's really similar to what Gina just suggested, which
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.920]   is, collaboratively, we do much better note-taking
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.080]   than we would as individuals.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.040]   And it's really hard to-- while someone's speaking,
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.120]   it's really hard to-- there it is.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.200]   It's really hard to type at the same time.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.640]   So if you have lots of people listening in and filling
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.120]   in different pieces that others might have missed or forgotten,
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.800]   I think that's a really, really powerful use case.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.080]   I also see, to Jeff's point, I think
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.480]   about taking it to the consumer, there might be a role for--
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.200]   I'm not sure that Google necessarily understands
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.440]   marketing or doing that whole appealing to the self-motifs
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.960]   thing, which Twitter did, which is to say, hey,
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.720]   you want to broadcast with huge audience, use our tool,
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.320]   and then it turns your actions and your opers into marketing
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.040]   essentially and saves you having to have a marketing team.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.720]   I think what might happen on the consumer side
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.560]   is the applications that get that might start building it in.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.160]   I can imagine it wouldn't be too crazy to imagine something
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.680]   like a Tweet deck having integration or a seismic desktop
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.880]   where it's bringing it to the desktop
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.680]   or it's bringing it into other applications
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.640]   where you're already used to that interaction with things
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.880]   like Twitter and Facebook.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.680]   What about mobile?
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.000]   So someone else might build it.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.200]   I think there'll be an application of mobile application
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.520]   for a wave, or is it just too rich?
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.020]   There is.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:03.520]   There is now.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.440]   There is.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.960]   Yeah, and it works.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:11.160]   I mean, surprise-- well, badly, but better than you think.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.640]   If you just visit wave.google.com, there's a mobile version.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.280]   And you'll get the little thing that says,
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.760]   you know your browser doesn't quite support HTML5.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.440]   So go ahead at your own risk.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.560]   Hit go ahead.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.720]   It's functional enough.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.080]   And I assume that as mobile browsers, especially
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.480]   mobile Safari on the iPhone and Android browser--
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.320]   You would need an else stuff.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.440]   Waveboard on--
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:31.880]   Oh, yes.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.040]   And waveboard, yeah.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.480]   Yeah, but I think you need to redesign the UI for mobile.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.840]   But go back to the shopping list app, right?
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.120]   That-- you could do that without wave,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.480]   but imagine a family getting together,
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.720]   a work group getting together, a journalist getting together.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.280]   So there's a big story going on.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.440]   And this person puts in a photo, and she puts in a caption.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.640]   Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.440]   That's where that goes, I think.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.680]   And I want to see a lot of real hard development
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.840]   toward that.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.200]   But yeah, I can see that you do that on the line.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.840]   Gina, wave could be a back end for something like that.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.760]   You wouldn't have to have a wave-like interface to that.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.600]   Yeah, I mean, it's all open source.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.000]   And the protocol is open, right?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.880]   So anybody can make any kind of client, right?
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   So for example, someone could easily
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.120]   cook up an iPhone client that just let you snap a photo
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.200]   and add it to a wave and let you set a caption
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.760]   so that a group of people could be at an event, a news event,
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.720]   snapping iPhone photos and creating,
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.560]   contributing to a wave gallery simultaneously
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.160]   without all the crazy drag and drop and extra doodads.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.000]   It's just an iPhone photo.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.800]   See, almost if you had a right only wave interface that
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.840]   was a simple interface that you could then go home
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.320]   and you'd have it all aggregated.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.840]   Right, Leo, but you could go a little bit farther.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.000]   You could also, in what Gina proposes, have one corrections.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.840]   Oh, Jeff got that caption wrong.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.680]   I mean, who doesn't know who that person is?
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.400]   You could also have assignments through the former questions.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:03.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.080]   I hear this is going on with somebody
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.240]   go over there and take that picture.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:06.880]   OK, I'll do it.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.720]   Here it is.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.400]   See, now that stripped down interface
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.960]   would be a very good public wave interface as well.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.680]   Well, I wonder, Jeff, I mean, you look at things like CNN's
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.640]   iReport, where right now it's kind of a situation, OK,
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.600]   who can upload a photo or you can add some text or whatever.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.080]   Could we end up with a truly collaborative--
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.240]   and I think I did actually write a call maybe a couple weeks
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.560]   ago with regard to all this stuff that's happening around
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.120]   Twitter lists and also wave to some extent.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.880]   Could we end up with a situation where you're almost
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.800]   the back end of a news organization and--
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.800]   Right.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.240]   There's this level below, OK, so you go to CNN.com
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.360]   and you've got all the filtered stuff, editorial.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.240]   But where is there a back end that consumers have access to,
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.440]   where I'm uploading photos, correcting things?
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.520]   And then they just push it over and it just turns
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.880]   to basically news sites into--
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.120]   I don't worry where you're invited in,
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.880]   because the Geo Twitter says, yes, in fact, Pete is really
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.040]   there, and Pete's photo is coming from there.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.000]   And we believe that.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.560]   At CUNY, where I teach, we're working with Nokia on a project
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.480]   to have an assignment structure, an assignment back end.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.000]   And we're struggling with that.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.740]   How do you take the journalist to get
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.520]   a co-system today and on a proactive basis,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.400]   say this story needs to be covered, who can cover it?
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   The New York Times, and it's blogged the local we work with,
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.000]   put up a post one by saying, we can't cover this meeting,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.760]   who wants to cover it?
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.840]   So there's that angle of-- there's also,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.560]   gee, 10 people are around this news event right now,
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.600]   and there's somebody in the newsroom working together,
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.480]   and they can all put it together into one cohesive thing
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.680]   that is constantly updated.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.400]   It's a living, breathing beast.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.520]   It's news, not as a product, but finally as a process.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.080]   To me, it only seems like if my SQL had come out and said,
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.400]   here, here's my SQL, here's the SQL search language,
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.600]   have at it.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.160]   Wave is at this stage is kind of like that.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.920]   It's like everybody's going home.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.360]   How nice, a query language.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.320]   But what's required is somebody to write--
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.720]   this is just the back end.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]   If somebody writes--
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.800]   That's why Gina is doing God's work,
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.400]   teaching the world how to do this.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.800]   And really who you need to teach right now is UI designers
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.240]   and application designers who are going to take that back
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.720]   end and give us some valuable--
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:25.880]   because really, Wave is just a layer on top of XMPP.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.720]   And a few other flavors.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:33.480]   Yeah, my hope is that the Wave protocol is not too difficult
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.200]   for developers to make great apps for it.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.480]   I mean, the reason why Twitter has so many great clients
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.200]   out there is because the Twitter API is dead simple to use.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.920]   And I hope that Wave has that same--
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   I hope that developers can rock the Wave protocol
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.160]   and make better clients.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.400]   I would love to see clients proliferate the way
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.960]   that Twitter clients have.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.480]   I think that's all it really is.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.520]   We're looking under the hood.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.240]   And it's like giving somebody an engine and saying,
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.160]   hey, go drive this car.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.720]   We still need a car.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.640]   By the way, that was the E-com E-C-O-M-M conference.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.680]   And this.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.200]   I also see the media wiki conference
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.400]   used it to do the minutes.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.680]   Ah, not wiki.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.200]   Ah, wiki media.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.560]   What I'm saying, though, is they didn't use--
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.600]   They didn't use, yes, right.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.560]   Oh, wiki.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.640]   They didn't use video wiki.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.680]   Wow.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.240]   Well, it's just not real time.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.360]   I mean, it's not real time.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.320]   You just don't have that saying--
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.080]   You don't have locking.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.040]   You have all these issues.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:36.880]   If two people--
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   You don't have the type of anything in one or five.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.920]   The problem, I used to use a wiki for the radio show.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.480]   And you'd have two people edit the wiki.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.920]   And it didn't have good locking.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.440]   And there was no multi-user-- there
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.200]   was very primitive multi-user support.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.760]   We just need a wave.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.600]   That's been the challenge for the wikis.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.880]   It's finding that line.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.120]   I think the kind of the news organization
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.920]   that we describe where you have this back end is still
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.680]   going to be a case of finding the line between process
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.520]   and product.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.360]   And at what point do you say, this is done and this goes
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.440]   to some kind of level of finality or readiness.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.320]   I mean, the news has never done.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.720]   But at what point do you decide and where's the line?
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.720]   Well, that's where that--
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.920]   We're taking it out of that position.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.920]   The wave is important.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.400]   I can now publish this.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.560]   And I can choose what to constantly update and what
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.680]   to freeze.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.000]   And it really goes there.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.600]   I mean, you see why the wiki people--
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.200]   obviously, Gina said it long ago.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.760]   There's more wiki than it is email.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.240]   By the way, the blog is media wiki waived.blogspot.com.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.720]   And it has a very nice plug for your book, Gina.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.640]   Ah-ha.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.140]   Oh.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.280]   They're paying attention.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.560]   They know how to find out.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.680]   We have a few more stories I want to get to in just a second,
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.800]   including by the way Jimmy Wales responding
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.000]   to the accusation by the University of Madrid
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.080]   that editors are leaving Wikipedia and droves.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.080]   It's not much of a response.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.120]   They're going to wave.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.200]   He says, no, they're not.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.120]   No, they're not.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.480]   That's the story right there.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.040]   No, they're not.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.480]   They don't really give much supporting information.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.680]   Just, no, no, they're not leaving.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.400]   I do want to mention Ford Sync, though.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.360]   Ford is very kindly decided to support this show and all
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.040]   the shows on the Twit Network, so that we would let you know
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.480]   about Ford Sync.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.320]   And I have to say, it's a pleasurable thing for me
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.520]   to do, because as a result, I went out and bought a Ford car.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.960]   And I'm loving Sync.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.160]   It bonds via Bluetooth to my phone.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.280]   Actually, to my phones.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.000]   You could do up to 25 phones.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.080]   And the point of Ford Sync, I really
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.680]   is-- I don't want to-- I don't think they sell it this way,
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.320]   but it really is a safety feature,
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   because now you can use your sound system.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.160]   You can use your phone.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.840]   You can get information all without taking your eyes off
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.760]   the road or your hands off the wheel.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.880]   You press the Sync button, the voice button on your steering
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.160]   wheel, and you could tell Sync things like, get me home.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.520]   It has GPS turn by turn, GPS built into it.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.880]   You can get 411 business searches,
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.280]   find a Starbucks stat.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.520]   I say that one a lot.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.920]   It doesn't understand stat, by the way.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.800]   It does understand Starbucks.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.480]   You can get personalized news, sports, and weather.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.240]   Even traffic reports, it knows my route,
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.360]   gives me the traffic routes.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.760]   It'll even reroute me if traffic is a problem on my way home.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   You could say, play this week in Google.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.240]   You could say, play twig 17.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.000]   It'll play it.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.680]   You can hook up a USB drive, a thumb drive,
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.800]   or almost any phone, as long as you have a USB connection.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.880]   I love a car with a USB connection.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.040]   I know I'm just now entering the 21st century,
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:37.040]   but I think every car needs a USB port,
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.520]   and you plug it in, and it's charging my iPhone,
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.160]   or charging my droid, and it's looking at all these songs
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.360]   on it, and it will index them, and then I can say,
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.720]   play the Beatles.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.200]   I can go on and on, but the best thing to do
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.960]   is to go to syncmyridepodcast.com and take a look
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.120]   at the new Ford Sync.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:52.880]   It is amazing.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.640]   The new version 3.1 is out.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.520]   If you've not looked at Sync lately, take a look at it.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.400]   And while you're there, Twitter to win?
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.920]   Yeah, Ford gets it.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.560]   Ford has a dedicated media guy, Scott Monty, who's on Twitter,
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.120]   and really totally gets what's going on with Twitter,
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.000]   and they're using Twitter for this contest.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.200]   If you use the hashtag #PoundSyncMyRide Podcast,
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.040]   say, I'm listening to twig.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.160]   Love, Gina, love Jeff, love Pete,
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.520]   and you add the tag #PoundSyncMyRide Podcast,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.240]   you're entered in the drawing to win one of 15 nano's
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.400]   and 15 zoons they'll be giving away through December 9, 2009.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.040]   That's all you have to do to enter.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.320]   Find out more at SyncMyRide Podcast.com.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.200]   And already, I know a number of our listeners have won.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   So keep up the good work and keep listening.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.760]   And thanks to Ford for their support.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:50.080]   SyncMyRide Podcast.com.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.320]   Let's see here.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.800]   Yes, Jimmy Wales, responding to the allegation
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.680]   that the English language version of Wikipedia
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.400]   has suffered a net loss of 49,000 contributors
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.080]   compared with one-tenth that number a year ago,
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.640]   says, our internal numbers don't confirm all the claims made.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.200]   We do agree the number of editors has stabilized,
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.720]   as one would expect, since we're already
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.480]   the fifth most popular website on the internet.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.800]   However, our own data shows the number of active editors
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.240]   across all projects is stable.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.960]   That is, new editors are replaced
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.280]   at about the same pace as existing editors are leaving.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.120]   I don't think he--
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.880]   Wikipedia is done, isn't it?
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.320]   It's done.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.120]   Yeah, it's finished.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.360]   They've written the whole thing, basically.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.680]   There's no new knowledge.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.840]   They've reached the last page.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.920]   They know they weren't right.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.840]   There is actually a genuine argument in that, which
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.680]   is that they have actually got the basis for--
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.960]   you're not going to go, oh my goodness,
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.320]   I've got Wikipedia doesn't have a page about that.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:50.920]   That's true.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.240]   It's kind of improved now.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:52.920]   That's true.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.520]   But that's because we've all got our pages.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.800]   There are fewer covered wagons going across America now,
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.400]   because it's been discovered.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.440]   I don't think it's quite that stage.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.480]   I like what Google's doing with--
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.520]   they're doing a virtual library of Iraq's National Museum.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:14.760]   Really interesting project.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.800]   Is there a precedent for Google ever doing something
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.120]   like this before?
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.440]   Well, books.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.160]   I mean, since books, they're moving on from books now
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.400]   to objects.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:30.520]   Yes, old Mesopotamian clay pot makers can't sue them.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.160]   In fact, I think the government of Iraq
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.040]   is very pleased to have them in there doing that.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:43.320]   I was serving as an alumnus of my alma mater university
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:48.200]   on their advisory committee on digitizing their stuff.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.840]   And it's not just books.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.440]   It's all the stuff in the museums,
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.760]   all the stuff in the galleries.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.960]   It's the buildings, too.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.840]   It's kind of everything.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.520]   It's everything.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.280]   I mean, and what I'm really impressed with is--
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.520]   it was Yale University-- is that their commitment
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.600]   was not to make money off of it, not to make it a private thing.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.600]   In fact, they actually went to Google and Microsoft
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.720]   trying to figure out who they should work with on the scanning
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.960]   project and end up working with Microsoft, which, because
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.680]   of Google's restrictive licenses, I believe.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.360]   But of course, Microsoft killed their efforts.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.720]   So I don't know what the status is.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720]   But at least they get to--
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.480]   unlike Google, I think they get to keep the data now.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.560]   It was a very subtle way you got that in there.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.600]   You're a yay-y.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.800]   Well, you notice I didn't do that at first.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.600]   You were trying not to.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.400]   I was trying not to.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.880]   Nothing wrong with CUNY, mind you.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   But OK.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.400]   My brother-in-law says I went to the best college in Connecticut.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.840]   And I'll grant you that.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.720]   Anyway--
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.280]   But I was really impressed that they
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.360]   want to save this stuff.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.120]   They say this is part of our mission as a university
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.680]   is to get all of this stuff within the Ivy-covered walls
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.720]   and get it out to the world.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.360]   This is part of Google's plan, though, isn't it, to basically
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.800]   index everything?
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.120]   Yes.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.120]   And it comes back to the questions around books, which is,
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.440]   OK, that's brilliant, Google.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.960]   You want to index everything.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.200]   But do we want a commercial entity
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.920]   to have the index of everything?
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:15.120]   Or do we want something that's open source and owned by everyone?
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.720]   Do we want Google to own the index of the world?
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.760]   Well, Peter, I think there's actually two issues there.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.360]   I think you're right.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.400]   What gets Google in trouble with books
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.440]   is that it was the first time that they were really
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.920]   playing host to the content, that and associated press
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.240]   stories because they got blackmailed of that position.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.920]   There's one matter to index.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.080]   Anybody can index.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.160]   How many crawlers do you have?
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.840]   Anybody can do that.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.200]   But to host the content is where trouble comes in,
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   where channel comfort comes in, I think.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.240]   But Google's response, I think in this case, would be, well,
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.080]   nobody else volunteered to do this for Iraq.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.760]   So what's wrong with us doing it?
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.840]   We had to do it.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.200]   What is-- in a way, this is a good test case for the book thing.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.640]   Is there anything wrong with Google doing this?
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.640]   Should Google step away and let--
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.040]   I don't know, who would do it, Iraq do it?
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.040]   And the other question is how much--
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.520]   how many of the rights does Google assert to this content?
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.160]   That's the key question, isn't it?
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.480]   Yeah, that's the question.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.720]   And I don't see any information on that.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:28.760]   By the way, Eric Schmidt went to Iraq, which is kind of a brave
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.200]   thing to do, brought his daughter, who just graduated
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.520]   from Princeton along as a consultant.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.960]   She kept busy filming the event for YouTube.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.440]   Good deal.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.200]   Good deal.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.960]   He says he does not believe digitizing the museum's
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.240]   collection will undercut its ability to raise money later,
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.080]   as many museums do by selling images of its treasure,
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.720]   kind of an analog to the problem publishers have.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.240]   He says what typically happens is it's a demand creator.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.040]   They'll still own the copyright to the images.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.040]   There you go.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.160]   Yeah, that comes back to that whole free argument, doesn't it?
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.400]   You give it away, and then you're
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.440]   going to get more people visiting your museum
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.320]   and checking out your stuff and buying the copies
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.840]   that you make money out of.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840]   It's obviously marketing.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.280]   So it's great for them.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.200]   And it's great for Google.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.960]   I think the-- and I want Google to do it.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.520]   I just-- we're definitely going to end up with a situation
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.800]   where Google is the street view for the entire world
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.960]   and the index of the whole web.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.160]   And at some point, the index of a lot of these real world
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.840]   things like museums.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.720]   Well, let me play devil's advocate.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.000]   It just comes back to ownership.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.120]   Let me play devil's advocate, because I agree,
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.360]   probably it should belong to all of us.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.680]   But it's a capitalist world.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.600]   Google's a company.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.200]   They're spending a lot of money doing this.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.800]   Shouldn't they get something for it?
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.360]   What's wrong with them saying nobody else is doing it?
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.720]   We'd like to assert some rights to it.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.640]   We put the effort in.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:02.880]   I mean, is the choice-- nobody does it?
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.360]   Because that's what it looks like.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   I think so.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.080]   I think if they hadn't put the impetus for the books thing,
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.200]   I doubt the publishers would have gotten together and said,
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.920]   hey, let's index all the books and put them online.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.720]   So it's going to take Google to do it.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.000]   I'm just making that point that is stuff
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.840]   where it definitely had it down that route.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.080]   It's in our interest as a public interest.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.040]   I completely agree.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.160]   And this is often the case.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.440]   A public interest and corporate interests don't gel,
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.000]   don't merge, don't match.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.960]   But it's in our public interest that it be open.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.600]   But isn't it too much to ask of a company, a private--
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.240]   a publicly held enterprise that they just give it away?
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.320]   Well, just index it and give it away.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.240]   They're doing the effort.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.600]   Why shouldn't they own it?
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.120]   Well, Rupert would say the same thing.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.640]   If the question comes in the new economy,
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.280]   how do you get the most benefit?
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.000]   But it's not easy for us to tell them
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.640]   how to get the most benefit.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.200]   No, I think at some point it's not.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200]   It's up to these choices.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.400]   Tom Feremski wrote a-- and I disagree with this,
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:58.200]   but he left a comment on my blog linking
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.880]   to his post recently at Silicon Valley Watcher,
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:07.960]   arguing that the Google algorithm should be in a not-for-profit,
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.520]   not the public domain, but a not-for-profit,
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.440]   and also arguing that that's what the Google
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.400]   founders initially wanted and didn't want commercial interests.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.880]   I understand that.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.920]   And I see that it works in the model of WordPress.org,
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.000]   owning the platform versus WordPress.com,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.160]   exploring it.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.040]   But I just fear that it's not going
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.480]   to get full investment and full development
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   without a profit motive.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.080]   Right.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.520]   Right.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:33.020]   I agree.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:33.760]   And someone's got to own it.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   I mean, do you want the government to own it?
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   No.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760]   No.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.760]   Right.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.440]   They do have a record of doing things in the public interest
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.120]   and making things free and available and of not being evil.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.080]   It's just someone's going to own it,
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.880]   and someone's going to have all that control and power.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.160]   But we certainly don't want the government stepping in and saying,
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.280]   OK, now you've got too much.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.240]   Let us get involved.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.120]   Because that's even worse.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.240]   I've decided I'm going to be the advocate for Google owning it all.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.080]   What the hell's wrong with that?
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   Wow.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.080]   It's there.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.080]   Does it create a new market where it's like another company can come in
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   and say, well, we have better or updated Street View images.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   There you go.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:21.080]   3D models of these objects in Iraq.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.480]   If you have a 3D printer, you can print out the actual object
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:26.480]   versus just this flat.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.480]   Does it create much better competition and for better products?
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.600]   Maybe if someone has the guts to step up and try that.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.080]   Well, the basis of IP law.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.360]   Maybe I should apply here as well.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.400]   You get because you did all the work,
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.480]   you get a limited period of time that you can exploit it.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.920]   And then it reverts to the public domain.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.680]   Maybe, I mean, seems like maybe that's the model here.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.720]   Unfortunately, copyright law is effectively infinite now,
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.880]   but it shouldn't be.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.200]   Is that going to work like the web, Leo?
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.640]   Am I going to have to stop putting no index tags on everything
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.080]   I own just so they don't sneak into Google's index?
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.000]   Protect yourself.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.800]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.200]   And Google has been very clear that they don't own the index.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.480]   I mean, they don't own--
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.560]   Well, wait a minute, they own the index,
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.720]   but they don't own your page.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.360]   They don't own the content.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.600]   You know, I think if Google wants to put together
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.520]   a lot of cars and drive around and map the world
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.760]   and compete head to head against the--
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:22.800]   I think fairly greedy companies tell an Avonavtech,
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.120]   they should be able to reap the benefit of that.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.640]   If you don't like it, go ahead and you do it.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.600]   And that's been fantastic for consumers, by the way,
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.800]   Google is having in there.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.360]   You look at the expense of mapping data,
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.040]   and they held it to their chests,
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.440]   and it was incredibly expensive.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.640]   You now have-- with this Tom Tom app, which is--
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.200]   What is it, like, 100 bucks or something?
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.360]   100 bucks.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.960]   With very limited rights, by the way.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.800]   And then Google's going to do not an Android.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.280]   It's just freely available, right?
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:48.780]   Right.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.920]   And Pete, in your neck of the woods,
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.200]   there's been a movement to try to get mapping data in the UK,
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.480]   which is owned by the people through the government that
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.880]   was restricted and for sale.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.120]   I think that's-- Tom Watson, I think, has finally
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.880]   said that's finally opening up.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.080]   So this part of what happens here is the precedent
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.920]   that occurs, it creates a demand in other ways
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.280]   that you can't predict that is usually, I think, a good thing.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.000]   Well, and I might point out, if you
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.840]   are a believer in openness and in mapping,
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.800]   there is OpenStreetMap.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.880]   OpenStreetMap.org.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.840]   They're doing open-source mapping,
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.520]   and they're trying to do a crowdsource like a wiki.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:25.680]   And I think they're actually doing a quite a good job.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.000]   These maps are pretty amazing.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.400]   When I look at my local map, it's pretty accurate.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.640]   And everybody with a GPS can add to it, can enhance it.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.840]   So this does exist.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.960]   It's not like there aren't open-source initiatives
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.400]   to do this.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:39.800]   But if Google--
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.320]   So in summary, we're actually quite happy that Google
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.400]   is taking over the world.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.400]   Yes.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.480]   I decided to--
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   Look, yes.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.680]   Does the pod be nice?
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.680]   I'm going to go to my back.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.800]   She's frank to you, Ching, and you know--
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.200]   It was too much work to fight him.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.800]   I, for one, welcome our name.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.840]   Google overlords, absolutely.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.280]   Yeah, when I wake up in the morning
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.240]   I find the Googlebot indexing my bathroom first in the morning.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.240]   I'm going to think, do we have--
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:03.720]   Don't mind us.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.520]   Don't mind us.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.440]   We're just coming through.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.400]   Just coming through.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.800]   Well, I think Google is struggling with a lot of issues.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.040]   This picture of Michelle Obama is a very good case in point.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.360]   Unfortunately, when it was hosted by a blog called Hot Girls,
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.320]   it's a picture-- a modified picture photo edited
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.080]   to make her look like a monkey.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.200]   Very offensive, very racist.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:33.120]   And unfortunately, it often was the first image
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.360]   to surface in Google's image search engine
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.680]   due to its page rank algorithms.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:40.440]   So one of the things--
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.160]   What was called as that?
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.280]   Well, exactly.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:43.840]   The people.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.960]   The people.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.240]   So one of the things Google did, which I think is very
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.440]   interesting, is the first way they handled it
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.000]   is by posting an apology.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.780]   They actually took ad words, and they posted an apology
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.180]   saying, sometimes our search results can be offensive.
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.020]   We agree.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:03.060]   With a link that said, read more.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.740]   And then if you click the link, it says,
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:06.460]   sometimes Google's search results from the internet
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:10.060]   can include disturbing content, even from innocuous queries.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:13.020]   We assure you that the views expressed by such sites
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.340]   are not in any way endorsed by Google.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:20.700]   That's more of a PR rear end covering, I think.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.300]   On the principal side, something in the world
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.420]   is that we'll offend someone in the world.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.020]   And if Google finds itself in a trap of having to censor
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:33.180]   or apologize for anything that would offend anyone,
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.980]   there goes the internet, all information,
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:37.140]   and everything we know.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:37.860]   It's not tenable.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:39.180]   What doesn't work?
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.740]   So I think they know that clearly.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.940]   They really accept it when China, Chinese government,
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:46.380]   of course, makes them do it, which is the hypocrisy of this.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.220]   But I think in that case, I got to say,
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.060]   I think that's more of a PR move to say, we can't take it out.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.860]   Here's why we can't take it out, but we're going to apologize
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.900]   for it so that we cut off your complaint against us
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.620]   before you go too far with it.
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.420]   I think this president for this as well,
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.900]   isn't there in terms of the George W. Bush result?
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.460]   Failure.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.540]   There was a failure.
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.180]   And they left it in, and they said,
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:09.020]   why they put in that question above the results,
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.180]   what's up with these results or whatever it was?
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.620]   I think that's as much as they can do,
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.460]   and I don't think they should get in the business
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:18.700]   of editing search results or removing stuff.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:21.580]   Or that's just kind of worms.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.580]   You're just--
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.580]   Right, but never going to sell--
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580]   That does raise another question, though,
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:28.460]   that the algorithm does have its prejudices.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:31.540]   It may not be human, but it has its prejudices built in.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:33.540]   And because it's not transparent and can't be,
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.020]   we don't know what they are.
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:37.660]   But the fact that you could Google bomb something
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.260]   is something they didn't want to want happen,
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:41.660]   so they had to change the algorithm to stop that from happening.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.340]   So in fact, there is a prejudice
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.980]   that they did have to deal with there.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:46.660]   Although they work very hard, I know,
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.380]   to avoid that kind of thing.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.740]   And they look very carefully at the search results
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.220]   that they get, and they're always tuning the algorithm.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.660]   You know, I'm glad you had this conversation,
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:30:01.220]   because the latest news is that they removed the image.
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:02.220]   I thought--
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:05.060]   So just now, I just did a search, a Google image search,
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.020]   from Michelle Obama.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.340]   And the image is not there, but it says,
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.940]   did you mean Michelle Obama ape?
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.460]   Oh my goodness.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:17.100]   So if you put on Michelle Obama ape, then you get the--
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.260]   Then you get the image in question.
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.380]   I believe that this is probably the image.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.980]   And then you get the offensive search results adword.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:25.580]   So now we're getting into even like,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.300]   gents, because this is obviously what people are searching for,
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.700]   right, because of the news story.
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:29.700]   Right.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:34.060]   So Google adjusted their results to be less offensive.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.460]   Exactly what we were--
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.940]   Well, but exactly what we said they probably couldn't do.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:40.820]   And now they do it.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.100]   Don't they open a can of worms?
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.860]   Doesn't it suddenly-- aren't they suddenly a publisher?
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.300]   I think Flake had got into a lot of trouble around this as well,
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.980]   in terms of they started removing images
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.580]   and then removing the conversation about why
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.420]   the image had been removed.
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:55.740]   And once you start doing that, you're never going to--
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:59.540]   there's no exit route, especially when it's political here.
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.620]   You're never going to get away from that problem.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.260]   I think Jeff has a legitimate point, though.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.300]   Why is it possible to get in the algorithm in that way
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.580]   that Google bombs still appear to work?
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.260]   I think it's an algorithmic problem.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:19.060]   I mean, OK, it's got to be descriptive rather than prescriptive.
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.860]   But by the same token, if people are doing things
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.620]   not because it's their natural behavior on the web,
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:26.980]   but simply because they want to get something to rank on Google,
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.940]   it's going to be remarkable to make a story.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.820]   I think there's something to be addressed in the algorithm
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.940]   there around Google bombing.
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:37.900]   And I guess Google could make the case that, well, by making
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.820]   the result be you'd have to type in AIP,
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.420]   we have improved our search results.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:46.860]   By taking it off the first page of results with Michelle Obama
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:49.100]   and forcing you to do a more deep search,
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.580]   we've improved our results.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.940]   But there is editorial in that.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:53.500]   Right, right.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.620]   And I should correct myself.
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.940]   It doesn't say, did you mean it's related searches?
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:57.780]   Related searches.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.660]   Michelle Obama, eight.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:31:59.420]   Yeah, related searches.
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.660]   Not just even less inflammatory.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.420]   It's even less inflammatory.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.220]   And it's--
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:04.860]   I don't know.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:05.940]   I mean, maybe they didn't do that.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:08.300]   Maybe that was done automatically by the algorithm
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:12.180]   when the original Hot Girls blog took down the image.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.540]   Maybe that changed the results.
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:17.980]   But it sounds to me more like Google changed its return.
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:18.260]   Right.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:20.500]   But if I put in the word abortion, right?
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.220]   I have three ads on top.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.900]   I have Wikipedia, Planned Parenthood.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:27.500]   I have something called abortionfacts.com,
[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.060]   which I'm suspecting by the look of.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.900]   I'm pro-choice, I'm pro-life, right?
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.180]   So that rose up.
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.260]   You had some diversity of viewpoint
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:38.420]   under the most controversial word in America.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.700]   But that third result could start Google bombing
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.020]   and can rise up.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.820]   So then if Google stops that from happening,
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.900]   are they saying that that's a gaming of what they've done?
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:52.260]   Is that a legitimate use like looking for this picture?
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:55.420]   It's a hard ethical issue for them to deal with.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:56.860]   Now, some people in our chat room
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.380]   are saying they're still seeing that image at the top
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:00.580]   of a Michelle Obama search.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:02.980]   I'm not.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.300]   And again, that's apparently, depending on your settings,
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:06.660]   maybe?
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.980]   I don't know.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:08.380]   So I'll--
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.700]   I signed out.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.020]   You signed out, OK.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.020]   I signed out to do it.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.020]   And I launched a different browser at Mature.
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.580]   I was signed out and didn't get it.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:20.420]   But there's so many different servers and different cookies.
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:22.580]   Don't do an image search for abortion,
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.940]   which is what I just did.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.740]   Oh, please.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.740]   Never do an image search.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:27.580]   I did a text search now.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:31.660]   Well, and the folks who discovered this particular image
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.380]   also pointed out that if you do a search for Jew,
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.340]   you get some pretty offensive results
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.900]   with the same Google apology.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:38.740]   It's an endless--
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:39.700]   I mean, I don't even--
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.900]   Barbara Bush, I've read, has the same problem.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:43.820]   So it's very difficult.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:45.140]   I don't know what you do if you're Google.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.020]   But I think the last thing you want to do
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.100]   is modify search results because of some perceived
[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:53.300]   defensiveness, because that makes you a publisher.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:53.820]   And you know--
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.580]   It's a sensor.
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.580]   Yeah, a sensor.
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:58.260]   Well, but there's even legal DMCA safe harbor stuff
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.780]   that you lose as a result as well.
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:03.900]   I mean, it's a tough line.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.340]   And of course, as you point out, Flickr
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.940]   has to deal with this YouTube has to deal with it all the time.
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:11.940]   We live in a new world.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.940]   Very interesting issues.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.540]   Folks, I really thank you for being here.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.940]   Pete, it's been really a pleasure.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:17.940]   I know you weren't feeling well.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.940]   I'm glad you're feeling a little bit better.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.940]   I'm feeling fine, Leo.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.940]   Good.
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:22.940]   I'm feeling fine.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:23.940]   It was a bit flu this morning, but I'm good.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.940]   Thanks to over-the-counter drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:29.940]   He is Mr. Mashable from Aberdeen.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.940]   So good to have you.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:31.940]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.940]   Mashable.com and @mashable on Twitter
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:35.940]   if you want to follow Pete.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:40.940]   And I would encourage you to create a Pete Cashmore account on Twitter.
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.940]   I have a long abandoned one.
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:43.940]   I should start it off.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:45.940]   And that would be Pete.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.940]   And then you could use Mashable to promote Mashable stories.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.940]   That's what I always thought.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.940]   I'm getting more and more into Facebook.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.940]   I have to start using the Twitter for the personal
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.940]   and syncing into it, I guess.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:57.940]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:00.940]   Facebook.com/mashable.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:01.940]   Mashable.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.940]   And that's the public page.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.940]   And you're using that also to promote your, you know,
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.940]   to talk about yourself or...?
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940]   I mean, it's not my personal page, but the problem is,
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.940]   obviously, that doesn't scare me.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.940]   It's not public, either, right?
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:14.940]   Your personal page...
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.940]   Kind of is.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:16.940]   Kind of is.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.940]   Once you get to, you just set everything to everyone.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.940]   Yeah, but you can only have 5,000 friends.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:22.940]   I know.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.940]   I know.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.940]   I believe in my test.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.940]   I've been struggling with that myself.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   You know what I ended up doing on Facebook is I created a Leo,
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.940]   my own personal account that's only friends.
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.940]   Then I have the original account, which is now 5,000 friends,
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.940]   so it's really essentially a public account.
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.940]   And then I have a page.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:43.940]   And never the twange shall meet.
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.940]   It's crazy.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.940]   Gina's got it all.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.940]   She's got it all figured out.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:52.940]   Just, you know, at Gina Tripani, go to smarterware.org,
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:57.940]   read the book, completewaveguide.com,
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:58.940]   and you'll be done.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.940]   Yep.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.940]   That's all you need.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:02.940]   That's it.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:03.940]   That's the complete Gina Tripani.
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:04.940]   That's it.
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:05.940]   That's all you need.
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:07.940]   Gina, are you going to stay in New York forever?
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.940]   When are you coming home?
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   I'm coming home on Thursday.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:14.940]   So next week I'll be from sunny San Diego on Twig.
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:17.940]   Oh, we didn't do the tip tool stuff, but I, since I used Jeff's
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:22.940]   number, I felt like I really couldn't do with it.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:25.940]   But Gina, do you have a tip you'd like to give us anyway?
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:26.940]   I do.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:27.940]   I have a quick tip.
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:32.940]   Google Reader this week added a fav icon to your subscriptions.
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:35.940]   And this is just a really little tiny aesthetic thing.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.940]   But it makes your, it makes your Google Reader sidebar look like a
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:41.940]   little candy store of like fun, a little branded, you know.
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:44.940]   A candy store, a information.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.940]   I maintain the better G Reader Firefox extension.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:48.940]   And this is a feature we had in the extension.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:51.940]   And I'm so glad that I don't have to maintain it in the extension anymore,
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:53.940]   because it's built in the Google Reader now.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:56.940]   But you just go to your subscriptions, are you settings area?
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:57.940]   And the content is.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:58.940]   So I have to go to preferences.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:36:59.940]   Oh, okay.
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:03.940]   Yeah, click, click on subscription or manage subscriptions at the bottom.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   Let's see.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:05.940]   Okay.
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:06.940]   Manage subscriptions.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:10.940]   And then in the, yeah, which is at the bottom of the page.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:11.940]   And there's all my subscriptions.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:13.940]   Do I have to go one by one?
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.940]   No, no, click on the preferences tab, which is the first tab on the left
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.940]   right there.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:21.940]   And then at the very bottom, show fav icons for subscriptions.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:22.940]   Yay.
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.940]   And it makes, it makes your Google Reader, you know, just like,
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.940]   yeah, yeah, just pretty.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.940]   Everything looks pretty because you get those little fav icons,
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.940]   the ones that you see on your tabs in Reader.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:34.940]   Yeah, I like, I like the fav icons because, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:35.940]   It is.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:36.940]   It's like a little candy store.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:37.940]   It is.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.940]   Of all your favorite websites.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:43.940]   Look, there's Jold on software.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:44.940]   He's so cute.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940]   Devorax head floating there.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.940]   That's great.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:48.940]   I love it.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:49.940]   Very good.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:51.940]   Do you have another number you want to give us, Jeff?
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.940]   Don't, because then I'll have to come up with it with a tool.
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:58.380]   I'll do a quick tip too, because this week, I think Gina was going to do this, but I'll
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.940]   steal it from her since you stole my number from me.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940]   See what goes around and comes around here.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:03.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:08.940]   Is that you can now attach documents to Gmail when you're offline, which you couldn't do
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.940]   before, which is the reason suddenly when you send Gmail, it says not that it's sent,
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.940]   but that it's gone into the out box.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:16.940]   Oh, panic be it first.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.940]   I thought, well, I'm going to buy off.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:22.940]   No, it's because it goes through the out box now so that if you're offline, it can sit
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:23.940]   there.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.940]   It's very good.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.940]   You need gears for that.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:27.940]   That's a gearish thing.
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:28.940]   Okay.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.940]   Yes.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940]   Thank you.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:33.940]   Yes, which is bad news for Mac Mac losers or on snow.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.940]   Google, bring us gears for snow leopard.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.060]   Well, that was going to be your wine of the week.
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:39.940]   Bring us frickin' chrome.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.940]   Well, that too.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:43.940]   Get gears.
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.940]   Just give me chrome.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:45.940]   Anything Google.
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.340]   What's the matter?
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.940]   How long can it take to recompile?
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:53.940]   What has been got to Bethlehem faster?
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.940]   Yeah, I don't understand what it's taking so long.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.940]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:04.940]   He's also their director of their interactive program.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.340]   See, I got it in this time.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.500]   The author of the fabulous, What Would Google Do?
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.140]   It's available in better bookstores and on Audible.com.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.020]   What would Google do?
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:19.900]   And you must read his blog, which is Buzz Machine.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:20.900]  com.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:23.340]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:26.260]   We hope you'll come back next week and don't forget you can watch this show live.
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:30.420]   215 Pacific 515 Eastern Time at live.twit.tv.
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:33.260]   And yes, now on the Roku box.
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:37.100]   If you have a Roku, make sure you go to the Roku application store and add "Twit" to
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.100]   your lineups.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.420]   You'll have Netflix, you'll have Amazon, and you'll have "Twit" and Google, I mean,
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:46.260]   this week in Google Video is there.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.860]   We're going to have all the shows up from now on.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:50.380]   This is one of the five shows we started with and launched with them.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.220]   We'll have all the other shows available eventually.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:58.220]   And soon, well, sometime in the next lifetime, we'll have streaming video as well.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:02.500]   You'll be able to watch that in your Roku box and your popcorn player and your Yahoo,
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:05.100]   widgets and television and all sorts of other stuff too.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.980]   And of course, your Android phones.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.980]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:09.620]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
