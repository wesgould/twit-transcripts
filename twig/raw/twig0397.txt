[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440]   filling in any
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.000]   Stacey's a fan Stacy Higginbotham's also here Stacy on IOT IOT podcast calm
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.120]   Because apparently she's to your right or left
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.400]   Depending our left she's on the left of the screen to my right
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.680]   Yeah, it's confusing
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.760]   She was saying how much you like Danny because he too had left right issues confusion. That's true. So am I looking at me?
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.080]   I'm just you were perfect. Well done. It's good. It's easier for me. Yeah, I'm the shit
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.880]   Think of me as the shelf put a dot on the shelf and then you can address me
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.560]   That's when I would when I was a virtual reality character
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.120]   That's how solid at O'Brien would seem I would just be a piece of tape on the wall and she would have a conversation with a piece of tape
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.200]   On the wall and then they would superimpose me later on MSNBC's the site
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.840]   Yeah, your time at the hologram might my days as a dot on the wall a piece of painter's tape that was me
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.880]   Remember that piece of painter's tape. So I got a
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.840]   Oddly in a Facebook message from Kevin Marks looking for a good large
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.960]   Android phone and I've I gave him the same recommendation on giving everybody really if who's looking for Android these days is
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.680]   Stick with pixel Google's pixel is a really yeah good Android phone. It's not it's uninspiring at first not colorful
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.540]   Oh, no, but it's it's it's elegant and I busted mine in London
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.000]   But how did you get an influence? I got the experience on I don't know what it's fixed
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.520]   So so I was I there's a support button on the about the phone. I went there
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.280]   Opened up the chat, but what do I do? They have a deal across the country with you break
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   I fix
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.520]   Isn't that the great name you break so within
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.040]   within
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.640]   Ten miles of my house. There were two or three of them. I
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.680]   Made an appointment. I was still in London. I made an appointment
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.720]   They call me in London just to make sure all my house if I want to know that I will be honest talk
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.880]   Yes, come on in I land I go immediately there because after all this is more important than my family or anything
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.480]   And so I drop it off two hours later picked up new screen do LCD beautiful beautiful
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   It's great and you have the XL
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.320]   I have the XL. I love the phone. So the one thing I want to I want the one minor little rant
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.400]   I want to go on it does amaze me that this this product category remains a product carry where you have to buy a case
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.120]   When do you buy a car condom? Yeah, you buy my back my house
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   Yeah
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.240]   Right and I just hate I don't like cases you buy the phone. It feels nice. You want to buy the phone, but
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.340]   I don't use a case my phones
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.520]   Well, so so so Craig Newmark Craig Newmark saw me have the phone without a case of the and he scolded me
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.160]   So I I got this they also sold me he should be great for forty nine dollars
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.000]   But I knew I knew you know just to cover but it's a special cover and if I ever break the screen again
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.680]   It only cost me nine dollars to get a repel. Oh, well, I don't see it. What is this?
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.200]   It's just a just a you know, whatever whatever. It's a shield. It's a good one screen. It's a thick one
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.680]   It's glass no fingerprints. Yeah, so there's glass. They have now glass screen
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.480]   Covered that it yeah, and they they had theory being the glad they'll break before the phone breaks
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   So if you drop it because I always drop mine on the edge, right? I get the design. Oh, I'm pretending
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.840]   Does it protect it if you drop it on the edge? Can you drop your phone and see for me Jeff, please?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:14.440]   The reason I'm the audience missed that they miss what Stacy used to do they miss this moment
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.540]   They did because we that was before the show began we learned the audience day
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.640]   We learned Tuesday's previous life
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.520]   We learned that Stacy at the end when at the end of her wedding the recessional as she and her new husband walked out the door
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   They played I've been working on the railroad and then
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:41.160]   Texas the University of Texas theme song the eyes of Texas are upon you which
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.760]   Exactly the same exactly like and if you're not singing lyrics in this thing which it is the same song
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.480]   It is the same song and we learned that Stacy in college for beer money
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.600]   taught kickboxing
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.400]   At 545 a.m. Most importantly
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.800]   Yes, so early you see oh it takes us a facey you've been with us for what about a year?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.080]   It takes about a year so before we really get to all the corners filled in is you know to the who you are
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.520]   But we're getting there now. I'm like wow if this defines me. I'm a trouble
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.640]   You know at all
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.820]   So the reason I brought this up is that as the rumors are flying about new pixel X pixel phones from Google
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.420]   We don't know when we know the code names
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:34.320]   They last year was Marlin and sailfish this year more fish musky and walleye
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:44.640]   Walleye was mentioned in the Android open source project so that sounds like there's heart their hardware is coming along
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.040]   according to Android
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.200]   I'm sorry droid life
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.600]   Musky is a five and a half inch walleye is the smaller five inch
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.020]   Then we're now we're now seeing a rumor
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.740]   That there is even a third full phone called time in
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.980]   In fish must be I
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.380]   Don't know chatroom is time and aficion
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.260]   Siberian time and Siberian salmon is this piece of fish in the salmon?
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.900]   Also, maybe this is that you know what I would that would lend me to think this might be the Chinese version of the pixel phone
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.500]   That's the new thing right you mix Microsoft has made a Chinese version of Windows 10
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.820]   To appease regulators there. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Chinese version of that phone. Oh wait now
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.060]   It's also the Eurasian giant trout
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:40.080]   Russia Mongolia and China could be the Russian version the Russian and Chinese version
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.560]   So I'm not sure what would be is a time in a big fish
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.460]   It is it's a large view. It's good for dry fly fishing apparently. So remember the Nexus 6 was codename Shamu the killer whale
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.520]   So that was a big one and I guess if time man is a big fish. Maybe this is an even bigger six inch
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:07.100]   Would you get a I'm starting to think that the perfect size for a laptop is 13 inches and the perfect size for a phone is 5.7 inches
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:13.440]   Smaller so I didn't phone laptop 13 inch. Okay, so you agree with me on the laptop
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.620]   But you want to smaller your woman. Maybe you have a little bit smaller here
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.820]   I don't have huge hands Jeff. You like a big phone you said
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.820]   Because I'm a manly man, but nobody wants a trump
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.100]   But did you but you had the Nexus 6 wasn't that too a little just a little too big was too big
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.460]   It was a little bit too in fact. It's my it's my five phone. It's my international phone
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.380]   So I still use it not only that a little bit too big and also because the back is is is curved curved like this
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.940]   Yeah, you can't use it on a dinner tables. It's rocky
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.620]   Yeah, when I'm when I'm eating alone in the restaurant I use it like a tablet now
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.540]   I have it is kind of a tablet phone that use for timers and stuff like that like I will argue argue that the perfect tablet size
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.580]   Is seven inches. Yeah, I would agree with you. I agree. Yeah
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.540]   Are there cases that you can stick on your phones coming back to the phone case
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:07.300]   But also the dinner table thing that have like a little picture stand that you can pop out. Yes. Yes, okay
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.780]   Craig Newmark's case is just that I'll ask him right. I like I suddenly was like oh my god
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.180]   That's the thing I need that I didn't know I needed until right this moment. Yeah, they have stands
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.980]   and some have stands only in
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.700]   Landscape mode some have stands landscape or portrait
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.500]   But I think landscapes normally what you want because you're looking at a movie or TV show on on a tray table
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   That's kind of the point, right? Oh
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.700]   You're spooning up your Cheerios and at the dinner table at the dinner table
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.100]   Not the dinner table. Sorry. It's where yes
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.820]   It's the same thing. Well, I say dinner people. I mean I'm out alone. I'm sad in a restaurant
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.580]   There's nothing worse. I have to keep company table for one mr. Jarvis again
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:54.380]   No, I just ate lunch today by myself and I love I love sitting at my little that's because they have a little one and
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.300]   Any moments to yourself from precious when your kids are
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:04.740]   Just I like people watching it's fun and eating so you have your phone. Okay. I'm just getting again
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.820]   We're filling in the picture of who Stacy Igamutham is I seeing you at his a motor that they kept
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.660]   She's dangerous. She's a registered weapon. Yeah, she's a loner. You don't mess with Stacy
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.940]   She's munching on a bear ball. I was a riser the restaurant with her phone on a stick kickstand looking at people
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:30.260]   But it's in portrait. It's not in landscape mode in portrait. Well because I'm usually reading or reading articles. Yeah, yeah
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:36.940]   I'm I'm not watching things. Yeah me. So so the thing is now I know I'm gonna have to get a larger phone for one reason
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:42.120]   This is all I'll be able to carry on a plane with me. This is shock. This has to be
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.640]   Oh, so there's two theories as to this
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.580]   New rule the rule is that certain Middle Eastern Airlines in certain cities
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.960]   Will be forbidden passengers will be forbidden from carrying
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.520]   Larger electronics the phone will be the biggest electronic the only electronic you can carry on board the rest will have to be in check
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   You can't you can't take even camera
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.560]   It it says they said ostensibly for security reasons
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.840]   So, you know, I think they're trying to make you think
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.880]   That there's new information and by the way, there's some there was a rumor that the
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.880]   That some that Virgin Atlantic was gonna consider doing this. Have they announced? No, the British Authority the British Authority
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.600]   For think of doing it. Okay, but they that's more there's kind of three theories aren't there
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:41.320]   Well, I know too. So you so the one is the one that's on the space of it, which is oh there must be some discovery about how people can make bombs
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.640]   There's a guy apparently teaching
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:51.240]   Terrorists how to make plastic bombs that are undetectable. They're afraid those could be posing as a tablet a Kindle or a laptop
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.000]   That's the obvious theory. What's started theories two and three?
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.440]   That it's a Muslim ban a Harris but ban on Muslims or that it's anti
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.680]   Government subsidized national carriers. That's what I believe is them. So
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.160]   It affects primarily Emirates
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.960]   Etihad
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.160]   through the three big Middle Eastern carriers and
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:25.000]   The theory that I read which I thought was very interesting is that this is a protectionist move by the US government
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:33.320]   Because the most lucrative passengers the business and first-class passengers on those airlines will switch to American carriers
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   Which for which there is no such ban?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:44.040]   So they can use their laptops and that this will hit economically hit hard these Middle Eastern carriers to the benefit of United American
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.840]   And mind you you're gonna come with the same airport security. That's just that's my point is
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.600]   Okay, you could ban it, you know universally if that's a problem you have to ban it everywhere. They're saying well
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   we don't there are other cities
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.800]   There are other cities that are far were it could crack us
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:07.200]   Airport by all accounts has no security at all. So why can you re-enlaptop on there and not not in Doha?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.480]   The rules take effect on Tuesday the UK has said it will follow
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.400]   Yesterday Tuesday the UK said it would follow suit with his but I don't haven't heard yet that they've done that
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.600]   Apparently from the DHS guidance that had
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   2016 airline
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.280]   Airliner was attacked perhaps by a laptop bomb somebody pointed out well the laptops of my carry-on
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:39.080]   There's nothing to prevent me from detonating it remotely via my cell phone a
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.820]   Remember they used to make you turn these things on to verify that they weren't bombs with air in fact working electronics
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.080]   They haven't done that late. That's such a pig. You imagine that story in that again. Yeah, that would
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.600]   Least I least I carry instant on things my Chromebook is instant on
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.800]   You pour for schmucks with a with a back and take forever Delta United and American
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:08.760]   Have long resented the fact that Emirates and Eddy hot our government subsidized
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.640]   and have complained along and Qatar
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.160]   Qatar Airways as well have complained a long time that they have a disadvantage
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.480]   Against these airlines because they benefit unfairly from government subsidies
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.760]   so it's not in fact in February
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.040]   the CEOs of United American and Delta set
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.960]   Secretary of State Tillerson a letter complaining about the massive
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:42.260]   Subsidization of three state-owned Gulf carriers in the significant harm the subsidized competition is causing the US airlines and US jobs end quote
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:48.360]   In a meeting with the executive shortly thereafter Trump promised phenomenal tax relief broad deregulation
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.440]   And other forms of support to the industry is this one of those other forms of support?
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:59.960]   It's it would they can't paint it that way because that would in fact be a violation of global trade rules
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:07.560]   Can't you can't you know so I don't know it's but what's what's sad is I think it is gonna
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.440]   Absolutely have that effect if I were traveling on any one of those airlines to the Middle East and by the way
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.840]   You may not be going to Dubai, but it's a very common stop over on the way to Asia
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   Yes, it is
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:29.040]   So I guess their hubs and spokes right so I'm not it's I'm gonna seriously consider thinking about Delta American or United
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.640]   So it's gonna have that effect whether it was intentionally or not
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.080]   So now add to that
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.560]   Your you know your computer and your phone or all that being subject to you when you come back across you saw the
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.440]   marijuana Colorado story, right? No, what's that?
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:53.200]   So a woman who had a boy Mexican who had a boyfriend in California came back a fourth couple times one time and they were in Colorado
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   Hey, they did what you do in Colorado now
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.920]   and
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:04.480]   They pulled her phone coming in and they she didn't have any lock on it. They look they go through all our social they go through all our photos
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.840]   she has pictures of a few bongs and things from the
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.560]   Grass store and
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.320]   Question about it and they kick her back out and she's indefinitely banned from the United States of America. Oh my god
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.200]   Wow
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   So right so I'm trying to do it. How do you go complete? Well, how do you go completely?
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.160]   Aniseptic
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   We've talked about on some of the other shows
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   I
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.640]   Don't know if I recommend this but one theory one thing would be to make sure your phone is backed up
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.720]   And then as you're about to arrive and arrive in the United States to wipe it
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.920]   Yeah
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:45.440]   But then isn't that a red flag when they say can you unlock your phone and and you do and it says what language you like to use
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:52.280]   So maybe wipe it and then set it up in a kind of base basic fashion. I don't know
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.880]   There's one I was thinking there should be
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.440]   Go ahead. Oh, it's just gonna say even if you have wiped it. That's fine. I mean they can't
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.360]   It's done. It's a fe a comply a complete a comply
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.640]   So it doesn't matter if you're an American citizen if you're not an American citizen. You're not getting it
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.220]   Sure, and if you are an American you could be detained for hours in airport jail
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.160]   We're just not funny there because you don't have the rights. You do not have rights there
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.920]   So here's the question so they can't make it they can you make you use your finger
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.680]   They can't make you under unless under certain dress put your passport in unless they have some some reason to I
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.920]   Wonder if there's some kind of application that
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.360]   Encrypts your phone locks it even from you until it's off
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   Like that it's like a geographic lock
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.440]   It's as long as I'm in this airport can't open it until your home. Oh
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.840]   Somebody needs to write that right now
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.600]   That's well, but you want you'd want to be able to use your phone in the actual airport
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   So it had to be the some sort of two factor
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.680]   so
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.560]   You could get around it some phones like the Samsung phone
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.040]   has
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:06.280]   They have a business and home use and there is a there's a locked folder on a Samsung phone
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.040]   It was Samsung wasn't this that a locked folder on the phone?
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.580]   That you could put stuff in that had a separate and additional
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.580]   Password it wasn't immediately obvious. It was there you could try that you could unlock the phone
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.840]   problem the real problem is what what often happens with
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.400]   border control
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   Apparently I haven't been through the borders since this started
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.760]   but is that they they get you to unlock it and then they take it and
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.000]   The presumption being they bring it to another room where they now
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.640]   Could be two things they're doing there. They're probably copying the contents of the phone for later analysis
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.880]   That's bad enough
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.640]   But once somebody has your phone and it's out of your possession and it's unlocked
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   You have no idea if they've put surveillance software on it. They could also put malicious software on there
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.280]   No way you would know and you wouldn't know so I think the best thing to do if you can I mean look
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.680]   I'm not going on a 12-hour flight without some sort of entertainment. No
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.880]   No, so
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.720]   Watch I want to watch the Americans man. Yeah
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.560]   so I think the best thing to do is
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.720]   is
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.920]   Take it with you normally and just wipe it before you get off you could still meet you make phone calls with it and use it
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.520]   But it just won't have any data on it and then if they do take it
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.000]   Then you have to throw it away
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.120]   Thank a lot of security experts say if if somebody if somebody takes your phone
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.800]   If long force would take your phone just you're done. Don't take it back. You don't want it anymore
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   Yeah, good lord
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.680]   So somebody said on on Twitter
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:43.320]   Go ahead. I think I think it's a real boon for the Sky Mall catalog. There you go. I was gonna say buy it
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   I'm gonna buy a burner phone
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.960]   Yeah, burn another way to go. Yep, and since I keep 90% of what I care about in the cloud
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.800]   Anyway, I can log in help me find the flaws in my reasoning here
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.520]   I log in and then when I'm done I log out and then you just hope it's not cached
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   right it's Chromebook
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.800]   these gentlemen you have a Chromebook and
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:12.200]   And you're using kind of you know mode and there's no there's no make sure it's a cheap phone because if they do take it
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.360]   You don't want it back, right? Right. No, the point is that that phone is done. Oh
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.920]   Yeah, yeah, this is just why do we have to worry about this?
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.840]   It's not apparent to me at all. Maybe I'm completely wrong that this is in any way improving our security
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.200]   No, no, no
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:35.280]   If it if you mean if this improved our security that you can make the argument we need to do this we need to you know protect our nation
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.200]   Improve the security. That's fine, but that's to me. This does not seem apparent that that's what this is doing
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.800]   No, but although
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:53.320]   I was gonna say if people if they discover a new attack they often don't talk about it obviously so they don't tip people off that they
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   know what's happening so
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.800]   Do I really believe that this is a security related threat? It's really hard. We don't know we don't know
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:07.760]   We don't know that's but there's the problem. Here's the problem Stacy. There's no credibility left. That's a problem, right?
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.280]   Because you automatically impute malicious, you know
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:20.360]   Motivations you impute their motivations because yeah, it could be real it could be real and we wouldn't know
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:29.200]   So somebody a star Simpson and Twitter suggested that that airline should be handing out Chromebooks the way they used to hand out
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.800]   Remember they for a while Google to promote the Chromebook was doing that they had little Chromebook booths at the SFO and terminal
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.880]   That's right and you could take it and bring it on the plane and then there would be a booth at the other end where you'd give it
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.480]   That's a let's Google's right opportunity
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.720]   And you can't stream the video maybe on the plane
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.000]   But you can download the video where you're in the lounge and then you have things to watch on the plane
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.440]   And then you hand back in the Chromebook has nothing your stuff. This is the ultimate first world problem though
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   We are afraid of going yes, it's your is an international
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.240]   12-hour flight we are going to arrive in a different nation
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   in the hours because
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.400]   We will have to sit with our own thoughts for that time
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   No, we're not to talk to the person next to you or read the sky mall
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.120]   All three sound like bits of hell
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.640]   They really do of course everybody's my sister
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   You're not you don't talk to the person next to you you're like one of those people no no
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:29.800]   I hate when people talk to me me to me to I do too. I don't like put in headphones and I cough
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:37.600]   I talk up Flem anything. Oh charming. Well, you don't want to be charming. You want to be the opposite?
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.880]   Hmm. Yeah. Oh, that's so funny
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.480]   So we're all missing throats. We're all missing throats. Yep. So does this effect?
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.960]   I did want to know just in case most people probably want to work why this is a big issue working and streaming
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   But what about like your Kindle? Can I bring my kindall? No kindall is included as well. Oh, man devices big which is absurd
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.360]   That is I'm sorry. That's absurd. There's even less electronics than that than a phone
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.080]   Well, can you imagine having the argument with the airport person? No, this is a this is a nook not a Kindle
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.600]   Yeah, no reading anything bigger than phone reading devices
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:18.480]   tablets what about a big phones and I bet you even some big phones. Oh, this is what would I do with my child?
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.280]   Yeah, oh
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:29.080]   She gonna watch the crappy movie do they say they in fact most airlines have removed the in flight entertainment because you've got your stuff
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.580]   Yes, because you have your device. That's exactly right Leo
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.920]   All right, I'm we shouldn't this really does sad sad that we're
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.840]   Okay, moving right a lot you could meditate think about things
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.680]   Get a deeper right and don't give me don't give me that my own sister and on Facebook read a book read a book
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.080]   Heavy our books allowed books are allowed books are still loud
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.760]   Free thought is still allowed as our books. Yeah
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.560]   At least for the time being for now for now
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.080]   All right
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.920]   That was so I think the big story of the week in my world. Yes, I may
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.920]   please is
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.480]   That the Guardian the BBC the government of the UK now AT&T all
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.920]   Pulling at my thing the big the big French ad agency
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.800]   Pulled their advertising from Google and YouTube. Yeah Google responded
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.200]   immediate
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   Yeah, oh now now you now YouTube cares
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.000]   Google has apologized and promised to improve
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Oh
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.680]   Shiller put up put up new we should say why they're pulling advertising
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.520]   They're pulling there is a team team statement right 18t statement
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.480]   We're deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.880]   Until Google can ensure this won't happen again. We're removing our ads from Google's non search
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.080]   platforms
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   That's YouTube display advertising
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.000]   That that includes ad sense right at words
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.680]   And that's in AT&T is doing that globally Verizon is also suspending ads with with Google. Oh, that's the one to me
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.280]   And so it's not just a customers of havas anymore. This is this is really spreading
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.600]   Oh, I would know it was it was separate like the Guardian did it. I think before havas did BBC is a havas client
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.040]   and
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.040]   Yeah, wow so
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.320]   So I'm going to post that means Klein go ahead
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:38.600]   GSK that I think that was through vivas the the briti the royal mail was through havas
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.080]   Yeah, this is a media buyer
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.280]   So Google's response we don't comment on individual customers
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:53.520]   But as announced we become begun an extensive review of our advertising the other link on the on the rundown
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.320]   I put up expanded safeguards for advertisers
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   So I was a list there, but this is
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.720]   It's funny that this should surface now
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.880]   I mean this is
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:12.680]   advertisers have always complained the same complaint about Twitter that you don't know where your ads gonna appear and for a lot of
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   advertisers that are very conscious about their reputation and their
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:26.880]   Public image this is an issue that they're reluctant to advertise on Twitter and I thought we had the same reluctance on YouTube frankly
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:32.160]   Yeah, I think the timing in part is fake news and also sleeping giants
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.760]   No, you all know sleeping giants. Yes, what no, what is that?
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.200]   So sleeping giants is a Twitter account where they find whoever's been on Breitbart and they publicly shame them. Oh
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:50.400]   Shame whoever's advertising on break. Yes, and it could be three or another
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.520]   Service, but they don't care and like they they actually just called out the New York Times
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.680]   Fairly recently Amazon they call out regularly because Amazon it separately has as affiliate things there and Amazon doesn't cut them off
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.920]   So there's there's more than a thousand advertisers who now pledged to pull out from Breitbart
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.120]   And this is coming on it's coming on programmatic the advertisers does not choose Breitbart
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.320]   They don't know they're there, but there's a quality issue here
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.520]   That's to be the interesting thing here is that is that so the piece I'm trying to write now help me write it
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.360]   Is that we're looking at this the wrong end of the periscope?
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:29.480]   Right, we're looking down and trying to find all the crap and and trying to tamp it down the easy way to solve this is to create quality networks
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   Right, which is the way advertising used to work right the the media brand created something quality the ad agency chose it as quality
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.360]   They put the ads there almost wonderful it all got screwed up by Google and programmatic and all that
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.640]   So the way to go back around is to create things that are quality and there's no one definition of quality
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:53.760]   Not how is human effort how is what sleeping Giants is doing different from what Peter Teal did to Gawker
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:00.920]   Um one question because you both roundly condemned that
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:08.760]   And difference here is that they're holding the advertiser response. They're not they're not going after ensuing them to put them out of business
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.760]   They are saying to an advertiser
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:18.920]   I'm gonna judge you by the company you keep but they are economic with using economic means attempting to put a bright part out of business
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:29.120]   Well in truth bright part doesn't care about its ads that's gravy bright part is supported by whatever but but that's what the attempt is right
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.040]   It's the same thing as you know the the family family, you know
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.360]   Going after advertisers is a time-honored tradition. I know it is. Yes
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:43.360]   so and it's it's very different I would say it's different from suing someone because
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.640]   You're using the same medium a medium of exchange like
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:53.400]   Advertising him his medium exchange as opposed to switching gears and going after them with the bludgeon of the law and maybe that's
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:30:01.640]   silly and doesn't make a difference, but I'm I'm seriously thinking about this and kind of like hmm what makes it worthwhile
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.160]   and
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.800]   You you have a similar though. Yeah, come as similar isn't it?
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.240]   But they have a choice they can say okay
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.800]   No and lose their advertising and presumably that's because a large the advertisers are worried because a large number of consumers care about this
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:23.080]   Whereas Peter Teal a large number of consumers or readers may not care about gawkers issue
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.320]   Whereas Peter Teal is taken it one himself to do it
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.720]   Right what is representative one takes away all your assets one cuts your revenue
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.160]   So there's there's there's an exponential difference there. I just I don't know
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.280]   I hate seeing people gang up on people. I don't know I just
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.760]   Well, but about the other way so bright Kellogg's was the first advertiser to be publicly pulled from Breitbart
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.980]   Right and Breitbart pulled all of its audience to go and boy
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.040]   And I was on Twitter did that work by the way
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:58.160]   Is Kellogg's business going down or up I have frosty now they have right now
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:04.200]   Because I talked to it you put cereal in your refrigerator
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.560]   That's yeah, wait wait wait hold on
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.080]   Do you have an ant?
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:20.160]   Yeah, bugs. It's humid here and if you leave your cereal it'll be a clump it just yes. Yeah, okay carry on
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:27.560]   I'm sorry for Stacey. I will stop being so intrusive. I am I am not your mother. It's okay
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.000]   You could put your cereal in the fridge or what so I was facing what random toothpaste to you
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I'm sorry toothpaste
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.360]   What are you?
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.240]   Crestrical Tom's Tom's Tom's me too. I'm Tom's you are of I'm Tom's -
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.840]   But he's in the day will not do anything but Colgate she thinks crest tastes bad and
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.520]   You could put crested in the days when you were real Americans. Yeah, you coke or Pepsi
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.400]   I don't drink soda no doctor
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   Back when you were kickboxing and I
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.780]   Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper yeah cuz she's a southerner I
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.720]   Did cocola oh
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.620]   It tastes like most those tasted like battery acid
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.600]   What does it say about you?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:26.800]   Is the only it's the only acceptable soda or cola brown soda
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.680]   I'm sorry I did that I was trying to figure out how else to do intrude on Stacey's privacy
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   back back to Kellogg's
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:44.920]   Question about Peter Teal and okay, it is I understand it's really it isn't really the same
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   But I just feel like yeah, it's a good point. It's a chilling effect on the speech
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.960]   But it also says what was possible
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:58.620]   It's like moral policing which we kind of do as a society and as people
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:03.680]   We we say hey, we think it's really wrong to I don't know
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:11.440]   I'm probably just a fair I'm probably just afraid that somebody would do that to me and so and somebody might and if enough people did it Leo
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.480]   I'd be out of business. Well, maybe it makes sense. I don't know
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.280]   If you're promoting something that provides little or no value right
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   I
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.040]   Don't know no you're right. That's it. That is that's a signal from your audience
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:34.620]   That they are not happy with you as opposed to a signal from one question billionaire that he's not happy with a story you wrote
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.180]   Yes, right yes. Okay. That's a that's free to some research at CUNY a few months ago
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:45.200]   Where we looked at a native advertising and a lot of surprising findings to me was how much the readers?
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.040]   judge
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:54.640]   Both ways they judge the brand by what why what media it appears on and they judge the media white by what brands are advertising on it
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:34:00.600]   You judge both ways the company you you keep and and to me this problem
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:06.160]   We have a media now this whole fake news argument is again looking the wrong way. We've stopped talking about quality
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:12.760]   We basically say we're gonna boil the ocean. Here's all the advertising possible the world. Oh my god
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   We have to keep you from going there
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.000]   As opposed to saying here are some things we selected that are actually very good
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.600]   You can be there and that creates a new scarcity and the value would be higher the question the first question is do
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.800]   Advertisers value quality or they say no in programmatic and retargeting
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.400]   I just care about the data about you wanting those boots on the fall of this boots are gonna fall you around
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.320]   I don't care where it appears right where I don't care
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:42.000]   Yeah, if the advertisers don't value quality we're doomed if you can convince the advertisers to value quality because it has an impact on them
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.880]   That's why things happen. That's what that's why this have asked thing matters
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.680]   So quality is a hard thing to do though
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:55.960]   because like the fact that I looked at a pair of boots and the fact that I might be a member of the KKK and
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:01.400]   Love a certain new site are completely irrelevant to the advertiser if I get to click on those boots, right?
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.280]   and so from their perspective quality only matters if it
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:11.600]   If it doesn't generate or sorry, it actually generates results
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   So maybe it's the metrics they matter. I
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.800]   Don't I don't know how to think about this also. I am being followed by a pair of earrings right now and
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.120]   It's very tempting
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.760]   You keep seeing the ad they know somehow that you want these
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.120]   Rugs and these earrings. They're everywhere. Wow, that's interesting. Do you put peanuts in your dr. Pepper?
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:40.120]   I have but I don't on a regular basis. I don't what do they do?
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:52.480]   I just know you're from Texas and I was wondering yes, we do some weird things I
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   You know more importantly more importantly
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.520]   big news and
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:05.560]   We're gonna lose our entire audience as they run to the play store to download Super Mario run is now out for Android
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   whoa
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.960]   Whoa
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:18.720]   So get get going now a word of warning I presume they're doing the same thing on Android that they did on iOS
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.640]   It seems to be free, but that is only an
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:30.920]   Appearance because after three levels of Super Mario run you will be dinged for ten dollars if you want to go on
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.760]   But they tell you before you they ding you right well, yeah, I mean you don't yeah
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:41.480]   You don't get automatically charged, but just just understand you're only gonna get three levels and then just as you start to say
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.960]   Hey, I really like this game. They're gonna say that'll be ten dollars, please
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.440]   So I should not introduce this to my child. Yeah, it's not really free
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.520]   Freedom's just another word for nothing else to do
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.280]   It offers in-app purchases
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.560]   Yes indeed it doesn't know okay
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.560]   so it says
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.400]   Super Mario run can be downloaded for free and after you purchase the game
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.840]   Oh, and after you purchase the game you'll be able to play the notes with no additional single
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   There's a single in-app purchase that unlocks the entire game, but it's ten dollars. I
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.120]   Don't mind that it's worth it. It's a great game
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:25.520]   Has it been available on Apple? Yeah, it came out for Sun iOS and it is just today just now is it was a ten bucks
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.920]   There as well as yes, well, that's what I'm saying is this is how they do it on Apple
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.360]   I don't I don't yet know how they're yeah
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.880]   Yeah, I'm reading I'm reading the instructions from yeah my Android play store
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.680]   Yeah
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:42.080]   So it says I can go through work from worlds one dash one to one dash four. Yeah, of course
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.200]   Yeah, so yes, you get four levels and then you'll be ding nine dollars ninety nine cents
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.840]   And then that's it just so I just you know public service announcement. That's how they do it on iOS as well
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   Now we're waiting the one more there's only one more game that I'm waiting for to make it to
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.960]   Android and I could finally toss my iPhone and that's field runners attack
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.520]   Then I'll be then I'll be happy
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:13.520]   Then I'll be happy as opposed to this angry ball of misery that you are I am so unhappy right now because
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:20.480]   It's exactly right. That's exactly right. Let's take a break it and that was a good story. Thank you, Jeff for bringing that up
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.920]   I will let Stacy pick her story
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:31.560]   There's some good I/O she stuff out there. I know which one I'm picking all right be good all right put your bets on it right now
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.120]   okay
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:39.880]   Now the wheel spinning but first a word from segment segment is plumbing for the data
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:47.520]   That you've been trying to keep track of about how people use your websites your mobile apps your cloud platforms
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:53.440]   You know in the past the way you would if you're using you know chart beat or Google analytics or you know all you know
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.000]   Optimizely or mix panel or whatever you would put a line of code in the page
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.560]   And you'd end up having a bunch of lines of code some engineer and have to kind of keep an eye on these things
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.040]   It's kind of a pain now a single line of code turns on segment
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.920]   And then you go to your dashboard on segment and add up to either hundreds of different tools
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.960]   You can add that let you keep track of how people are using your stuff
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.400]   How users are engaging with your business?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.920]   You don't have to write any custom code you don't you can one
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:31.200]   One single API one single integration will unify all your data from market toe to mailchimp
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:37.960]   Segment is the platform is used by some of the world's best companies Atlassian uses it into it new relic Reuters

[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   Well, I lied to I I have to so okay. Here's the story. I was going for in case anyone had money on it was the Google home
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.000]   Beauty and the Beast Dad
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.040]   Which I have an opinion on but go ahead
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.280]   Okay, we'll do that later. I'll be my story. Let's talk about that. All right actually and you know
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:22.720]   Have you have a Google home, right? I do yeah, so I I did not get the the my day experience
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.000]   I did not get the beauty in the Beast Dad, which is a shame in the target market
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.680]   Well, let me play what some people so the my day explain that Stacy. What is my day?
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:39.080]   It is your your wake up with like I think of it as talk morning radio, but it's your commute time your news briefs your
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.160]   weather
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.600]   I feel like you can add things to it. You can customize it. I don't actually use the future all that often
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.320]   Because what do you how do you ask for it? Well, sometimes I do just by accident. I say
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.840]   Good morning. Okay
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:58.200]   You know who good morning and she'll say good morning Leo today is March 22nd
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.560]   2017 all right, so let me confuse her
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.800]   Okay, Google good morning
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Hey
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.760]   So she's telling you a time it is what the weather's like your calendar so here
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.520]   Let me play this though because this doesn't work anymore. This is from Twitter. Okay Google stop
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:25.880]   This is this is a demonstration of the beauty in the beast problem. Okay Google stop
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:37.080]   Harland okay NPR okay Google stop take it off the internet
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.640]   Okay Google what's my day like?
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:49.800]   Hello Bryson the time is 7 44 a.m. The weather in Park Ridge currently is 21 degrees and sunny with a high of 37 degrees
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:57.080]   Your commute to work is currently 39 minutes by public transit by the way Disney's live-action beauty and the beast opens today
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:04.680]   The story fell as the inventor instead of Maurice that rings truer if you ask me
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:12.640]   For some more movie fun ask me to tell you something about Bell now was that a paid ad from Disney the latest news
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.200]   They said no, right? I don't think so so they've done this every day. They'll do this
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:23.520]   They did one when Steve Martin's birthday said today Steve's Martin's birthday, and they did a little bit of king Tut I
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.720]   Think they just trying to have fun. This you're obviously human editors write these and I think that this was I
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.920]   Think it was a mistake obviously it looks like an ad, but I don't think it was intended to be an ad you think Stacy
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:42.000]   Well, so here's the deal. I don't care if it wasn't ad or not because Google came back saying it wasn't an ad and people were like well
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   and there but
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.040]   The question the only thing that matters is did money or some item of value change hands, right if it did
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.520]   Then it's an ad yeah, and I think this gets to though how pernicious
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.320]   some of these marketing agreements can be when we talk about like IOT and
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:07.200]   Even even our phones things that suggest like content contextually aware applications that suggest things to you
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.320]   So I think it's really important we have and I'm gonna use that famous a bright line rules about
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:19.080]   What we decide is an ad in how we make people disclose it on small screens?
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.720]   invoice apps etc cuz this is
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.960]   And it's damaging to Google. I mean think about how many people were like
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.160]   It is I think it was a mistake, but I don't think it was a paid ad
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:38.400]   But you know it sounded like one so that was it that was a big mistake on their part well, and what about these marketing agreements?
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.720]   I mean that that's that's well
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:46.000]   I'll give you an example remember when Google named Android KitKat and they said then no money exchange hands
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.320]   But that was clearly promotional right
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.560]   Well, I was I was thinking about the Harry Potter
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.520]   implementation on the phones around the fantastic beasts right those are ads
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:05.960]   Well, yes, I assume that was an ad doesn't there the FTC has very strict rules. You can't don't they maybe not they do
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.440]   They have it for bloggers, right? We can't friend. I can't tweet. Hey, I really love segment
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:18.040]   Twitter without saying hashtag ad or hashtag sponsor or our sponsor
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   Segment you have to indicate very clearly this is an ad or this is paid placement actually it doesn't even have to be paid placement
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.160]   They wouldn't necessarily have to pay me for that tweet for it to have to have to be disclosed
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.400]   It's they pay me for ads elsewhere, so I have to disclose that
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:38.240]   That's that's very they're very clear on that for bloggers maybe less so for order, you know artificial intelligence
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.160]   I don't know
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.280]   Yeah, I don't think they're any rules yet for a yes or IOT devices
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.560]   But what we don't want is a world where we get these all the time
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.060]   Constantly thrown and you also want some option you want you want some op you want? Oh, we can play you the theme from
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.720]   Beauty the beast would you like to hear it?
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.520]   Taylor's oldest
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.040]   Nice voice
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.800]   No, I like the bit you have a deep voice sounds good
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.560]   They did they did play a little music right little piano music
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.600]   I don't know if that was from Beauty and the Beast and then they said ask me something about Bell
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.680]   Encouraging interaction, but that's kind of how Google home is is a little playful. They're trying to I
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.140]   Don't know what I don't I think it was an I think it was a mistake
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:29.400]   Well, and it's just a time-waster and think about think about like on your car if you're driving and
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.640]   You know, there's an ad that's relevant to like a certain place you might be right now I
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:42.760]   Your car could suggest hey want to grab a burger? You're right by such and such or maybe you're ask your car
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:48.080]   Hey, what's for lunch? What's is there a restaurant near me and then seeing that you know?
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.800]   Getting that via voice. How are we gonna mark that as an ad right?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:59.200]   Because like right now if I ask Google that in my phone it gives me the sponsored listings and it gives me all the other listings, right?
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.960]   It's all kinds of really fascinating challenges what voice puts together
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.180]   I mean I had three challenges off the bat first is monetization
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:11.580]   Yeah, second is brandine is very difficult and third is when you ask a question to Google
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.580]   I think gives you an answer
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.640]   as
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:20.260]   We've seen recently it may be the wrong answer, but it gave you one answer because there's only one opportunity for dancers
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.160]   We had a good discussion last week on that
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.600]   I'm sorry what you weren't here Jeff
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.320]   Yeah, because I said this is the problem when you go from being a search engine any piece
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.680]   Yeah to being a fact engine and I think that this is a real difficult challenge
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.840]   Because a search engine would give you multiple results some of which might be fake news
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:43.340]   But there would still be legitimate search results, but if you're gonna say I'm gonna give you the one true fact about this
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:48.080]   That is a heavy burden you're putting on yourself, and I think Google shouldn't even get in that position, but
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.420]   That's up to them obviously
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:55.060]   It's kind of way that's what you need in an on-demand contextually aware kind of
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:48:02.820]   What yeah, yeah, so you don't watch 20 results. Well, let me give you 15 search pages. You could go to that's not useful
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:09.080]   Here are the options now. I wonder if something like so in our show when I do an advertisement
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:17.120]   One I announced that it's an ad but we also have little music playing underneath as a way to like delineate it as different from the rest of the content
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.920]   And it's the same music every time so every year so you have a little little ad bed that you use yeah
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.440]   Oh, that that's a cute way to call it. Is that why you is that's interesting. That was your idea?
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.120]   It was actually my my partner's idea so but we just he was like hey
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.640]   Why don't you play some music to make it so you'll know even if you even if you skip through right in your in the middle of the
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.640]   Ad you're still getting
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.680]   Undercurrent I could we could try that that's an I mean I think we're pretty clear when we go to an ad and when we come out of it
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.600]   But but I've often thought maybe we should be clearer so there be no confusion
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:56.340]   I don't my I never ever want to be in a position where people think content like you think an ad is content
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:02.220]   Obviously and I think that's the problem Google got into there's no clear way to say
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.740]   This is not an ad. I'm just giving you something
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.160]   I think you'd be interested in which is the beauty and the beast opens this weekend and it was it was a huge weekend and
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.620]   Massive opening it may have been really surprised you heard by the way the kid
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.100]   His in that tweet there was a kid going yeah
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:23.500]   Because I mean Google home did the right thing because that kid was really excited right
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:29.460]   So maybe Google knew there's a seven-year-old in that house. That's gonna be very excited about this. Oh
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.980]   Then why didn't I get it?
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:42.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. No idea. No idea
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.940]   I'm a little sad now occasionally by the way somebody's saying well, you know your audible ads verge on content
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:54.220]   I'm not saying we won't stick content in the ads. I just don't want to mix ads into the content
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.860]   I don't want you to be listening to content and think you're hearing listen listening to an ad and think you're hearing
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.700]   I don't want you to be listening to our show when we we sneak an ad in under the
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.020]   But if you're in the middle of an ad and I mentioned there's some great books
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.260]   I like that that's content, but I don't think that that's
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:16.620]   Confusing I hope it's not we also used to do unpaid ads on the show this show. Oh, yeah for Chipotle
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.620]   and glee
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:26.300]   Bastards that's never game. No, you know what some guy was here. He was like the IT guy from Chipotle gave me a ton of Chipotle
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:31.100]   In fact, we had Chipotle lunch today. So one burrito. No
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.780]   No, we got lunch for 20
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:41.260]   He gave us a coupon that said lunch for 20 and we've had the whole staff today at Chipotle on that coupon
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.460]   By the way, thank you. Whoever you are masked man
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.660]   Wow
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.500]   Yeah, I think as I sneak ads in
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:56.500]   I'm so you don't I feel bad if I do that and maybe we do need to get a little tinkle-tinkle bed
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.020]   Can I borrow your tinkle-tinkle bed?
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:05.700]   I am not answering that question at all. What is the what is the song? That's like a that's a Trump
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:10.620]   Moscow joke, I'm not going there. Yeah, there is Carlton
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:19.940]   It's my theme music. It's my it's the intro theme idea. Maybe I should do them somebody saying you should do them in a funny voice
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.940]   And now it's time
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.860]   Yeah
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:34.460]   Actually advertisers of course always want your ad to sound like content. They don't want you to seem like an ad so
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.020]   Get the get pink Floyd get the rights to Pink Floyd's money and then
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.020]   the
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:47.100]   Go in the background sure why not
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.740]   Yeah, that's what Paul Harvey did he would go now
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:56.780]   I don't think anybody knew that that's what this meant, but he would say page two and then he'd read an ad page three and
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.380]   That was his way of saying it was an ad which was weird, but I
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:07.220]   Think you just way I've been working on the railroad every time you go to play. I've been working on the railroad. I love it
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:13.860]   Okay, nice 16 tons
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.020]   What do you get?
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:21.660]   The other day older and deeper in debt we like that song cuz it's in our key
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.940]   Which is deep I was gonna say wow
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:32.220]   Deep the deep key so our conclusion is that Google probably didn't tend to put beauty in the beast in there
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:37.180]   I would certainly hope that they don't if they were thinking at any point about paid placement in
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.580]   the Google Homes
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:40.980]   Messages they probably have stopped thinking about that
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.580]   That's a terrible place to put it too because that's like I mean
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.060]   It's great from an exposure perspective, but that's like information you need fast, right and then
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:54.220]   Done although they did it at the end in fairness. Do you think they're gonna do that?
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.260]   That's it's really it well
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.580]   They didn't know you know what they didn't do it the end because the next thing then was news briefs and
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:05.580]   And so it isn't at the end in fact, it's the beginning of the stuff that really becomes useful, which is the news
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:10.460]   The weather is the most useful part. I hope we yeah, right?
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.340]   I hope we don't see that because I would be that really would make
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:20.100]   Amazon's echo less useful and all these things yes useful because and the and the that's hmm. That's interesting. I mean
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.700]   It is a free service gonna be both of the ratarines
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:26.060]   transactional devices
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.740]   I buy stuff on home all the time every I mean everybody knows that
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.380]   Everything on the echo and home is just added purchases to
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   Yes, they just added local, but okay, so let's let's
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:46.060]   Break this apart you pay for the device the service itself is gathering incredibly valuable data about you right?
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:51.340]   Those both of those platforms they're getting paid in other places. They're getting paid in other words
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:57.060]   They're getting playing so yeah unless we tear I mean unless no one ever looks on the web again. I
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:03.060]   Promise that Google's getting plenty of value out of this Amazon. It's a no-brainer for them
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:08.220]   Right, I order stuff all the time from Amazon. In fact the latest is that you can order
[00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:14.100]   Amazon now, I'm not in one of the cities. Maybe Austin's one of the cities, but it's not I
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:22.660]   Know and I know that New Jersey's not but you can you can actually ask your Amazon echo now to get something to you within two hours
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:29.780]   Some places you can actually get beer and wine served you to huh wow I want I want
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.460]   Amazon mama needs a drink
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.460]   Oh
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.820]   Be amazing
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.340]   Eat alone you drink alone
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:46.700]   Can you but the real test is can you order dr. Pepper with peanuts in it?
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.780]   No quick before they dissolve
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:55.380]   Do the penis dissolve I don't I don't really know what is the point of the peanuts?
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:00.540]   They're just salty. They add a nice little flavor. They add a little extra flavor. Maybe they do dissolve. I've never kept them
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.740]   I always I'm making it up, but I just think it's you know
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:08.440]   You know that old saw that if you put Coke on on tar on a bumper it would dissolve it. Oh sure
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:14.180]   It was very sick very acidic. Yeah, we used to do that. We used to clean our pennies with Taco Bell sauce which is
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:24.540]   That you did you did guacamole facials what oh
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:27.740]   Mule oh meal oh meal works now
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.420]   Welcome, oh so so
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.860]   Starbucks has a new
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.860]   smashed avocado product
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:43.780]   What's feed review what yeah, they smash toast is the totes avocado toast is oh I love avocado toast
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:52.740]   Starbucks best thing ever has avocado spread and and BuzzFeed to create it look like baby poop on a bagel
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:58.300]   Starbucks is finally jumped on the avocado toast trend
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.460]   Oh, it comes in a little metal
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.180]   Schmir bucket
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.980]   It'll smear bucket
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:10.540]   And they and they apparently have sous vide eggs as well
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.820]   Yes
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.860]   I'm not getting avocado out of us out of a schmir bucket
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:23.260]   No, it's not smashed fresh. Yeah, that's just that's guacamole. That's the idea
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.860]   It's guacamole. I was like there's a company called holy guacamole and it is they actually serve it
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.940]   They have these little I love these things by the way
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:37.020]   There are 100 calorie packs and I don't care that they're 100 calorie packs. They're two tablespoons of avocado like guacamole
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:41.180]   Yeah, and it's just it's salt avocado vinegar and
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:47.500]   I think that's it. There may be like another seasoning in there, but those things are awesome
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:56.300]   Hello, so julie julie rindstein decided to do a science experiment with tanya chan on twitter leaving the
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.260]   avocado smir
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.940]   Schmir bucket open and out to see how long would take to turn brown
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.820]   18 hours later, not just brown black
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:11.100]   Well, it's good. It's good. Yeah, that means it's fresh. Yeah
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.100]   But you know what?
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:18.940]   Uh, if you can if you if you live in an area where you can get guac avocados at a reasonable price and that by the way
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:23.100]   As soon as we build the wall and we have start terrafing is not going to be easy
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:28.380]   Uh, but that would I threw it a little you know, I should have a little hashtag political
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:33.980]   A little maybe a little I could play a little music underneath that music there too. Yeah
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:40.220]   Anyway
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:45.580]   It get a fresh avocado and fork mash it on a nice piece of toast. That's a fabulous meal
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:52.060]   You should add so i'm gonna you stand several salt and for avocado toast a little lime juice
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:59.980]   A little bit of lime juice that's a little hot sauce too. I'm sorry. No a little lemon not lime is for guac lemon lemon lemon is for your avocado toast
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.900]   Sorry, by the way stacy. Yes ma'am. He's a guacamole
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.540]   He's in guacamole
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:11.420]   Oh no, that's no who puts peas in guacamole? That's that's we're times
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.700]   No
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.780]   Oh, I agree
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.500]   That's some man hat nights idea of guacamole
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.300]   New York shini
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:28.380]   So when the washington post put its new slogan up, you know democracy dies in darkness
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:33.580]   There were a lot of suggested ones. My favorite was we would never put peas in guacamole
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.900]   That
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:42.860]   That's good. What do you think of democrat with that slogan democracy dies in darkness? I like it. What do you think stacy?
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.380]   Oh
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:50.140]   Scatchy. I don't know if it explains. I mean it doesn't explain anything that what journalists do. I guess i'm
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:55.900]   Democracy dies in darkness. It sounds I don't know it sounds so grim grim. Yeah
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:01.020]   Oh, we're living grim times democracy grim eyes in darkness
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.820]   I don't even think it's technically correct
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.060]   Otherwise, we'd have no democracy at night
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.700]   so
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.700]   I understand the theory, but
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.140]   It just does not send me
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:21.500]   Anymore like it's like it's the trunk caused a detour on this train
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.740]   It's the trunk. Oh, there is no detour on this train. It says you think and we have tracks. There's no tracks
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.180]   I was gonna say there's much. Yeah, this is an off road show
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.180]   This is an off road show if ever there ever ever was one
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:38.220]   You're going through dunes. I feel so bad for
[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.500]   Kansas City
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   losing their google library
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.740]   Nope, but it's there right they have some installs that have just stopped
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:51.820]   Who was I mark canter tweeted he'd been he's spending
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:57.260]   Days years going back and forth from cleveland of kansas city trying to set up
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.660]   a business based on google fiber
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.980]   And he was very sad. He said wasted wasted google has canceled
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.540]   Google fiber
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:11.660]   Many kansas city residents who have been waiting years for google fiber to install service of their homes recently received emails
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:18.060]   Cancelling their installations according to ours technica with no word on whether they'll ever get internet service
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:23.020]   They uh, they the speculation
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.580]   Is the number of cancellations in the metro is as many as 2,700 so it's not it was not going to be a
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.340]   Lot of people anyway, but boy, that's got to be disappointing if you've been
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:40.540]   That's got to hurt. I'm in austin where they were I mean they they they launched and then it stopped and and what happens
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.060]   I mean I assume they're going to sell this as an asset to somebody
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.260]   When you think i don't if anybody wants it
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:52.140]   Having that much fiber because they built their own
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.740]   They have the they have the fiber in yeah, well in
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:01.020]   In austin, I don't remember the exact number of root miles they've put in
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.380]   Hey, hey ups guys here. I was like gadget delivery. Um
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.260]   Sorry about that, but they they've actually installed like
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:19.340]   Tens of maybe not tens of thousands thousands for sure of root miles of fiber in the ground and now what happens to that?
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.780]   Who wants that? I would think it's a great asset, but I could be wrong
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.980]   so
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.700]   Google sent this response to dsl reports google fiber loves kansas city
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.020]   And is here to stay
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:37.820]   We've been grateful to be part of your community since 2011 and for the opportunity to provide super fast internet to residents
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:42.300]   We recently announced our expansion into ray more we're continuing to build an overland parking
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.780]   Can't wait for even more customers in kansas city to experience what's possible with google fiber
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.900]   So what happened with these people?
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:54.220]   There some other has been waiting as long as 18 months for service
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.820]   But google doesn't explain what's happening to them
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:05.020]   We we had mentioned that google was cutting back that they were canceling wasn't kansas city the second city or was it?
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.740]   Was the first city it was the first city. Yeah
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.900]   Because I I remember vividly
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.540]   being there and being all excited and
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.860]   the joy
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.620]   the thrill
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.540]   Learning that kansas city is the city of fountains. Did you live? Oh you went there to cover it?
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.100]   I did they have a terrible airport
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:33.740]   You know, that's the problem with america. We have second-class airports, but that's going to change my friends
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.940]   Thanks to the great infrastructure spending that's
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:43.260]   Not going to happen google is letting celebs speak directly to fans via search results
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.060]   This they did during the election, but now they're broadening it
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:54.780]   You should you should uh sign up for this. I ask it. It costs money, right? So the uh, it's called posts
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:03:01.180]   And you could post status updates that will appear so when when somebody searches for you you will get us
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.580]   They'll will get a status update
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   So if you're searching for this is google's quote if you're searching for henry for museum in the us
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.060]   Very fine museum by the way and dearborn
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:14.540]   Or for vanesa damata in brazil you'll see updates directly from the source of relevant
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:19.900]   Information like new exhibits timely updates and interesting facts. Do you have to pay for that? Is it an ad?
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:23.100]   I don't think so. It's like twitter on google. Yeah
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:29.740]   Yeah, so no his lowest part of search, you know search proper. I don't think it's your presence on google fresher than ever
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.780]   Up to date posts from verified people or places or things. Oh, we should do this
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:43.340]   Posting a request access who can post we've opened up posting to museum sports team sports leagues and movies in the us plus
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.980]   musicians in brazil
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.980]   That's it
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.220]   What
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.620]   Okay, so i'm not a movie or a sports league or i kind of a museum
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:04:01.260]   I could I could release songs in brazil. That's so weird. So you have to be one of those, huh?
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.500]   That's why they mentioned like the henry for museum movie. Why not a tv show?
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.780]   Wait, why people in brazil is this?
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:16.380]   Everything everything is more advanced with the internet in brazil apply to post on google
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:24.860]   Email address first and last name entity name and then category movie museum sports team sports league or other drive the other
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.460]   famous internet show
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.420]   I'm big
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.140]   in brazil
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.100]   How about that, would you think that'll work?
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.700]   So brazil photo log took off in brazil before there was any
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.540]   um
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:48.700]   Other photo services what is photo log? What's mccollit photo log was
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.500]   scott hyfehman the founder of
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.660]   Meetup his prior company was photo log before there was flicker there was photo log
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.540]   It was huge. It was a photo sharing site. Brazil is the
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:05.340]   Yes, brazil is the only country that licensed a version of of blogger before it was sold to google. That's cool
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.980]   brazil was of course
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.340]   the
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:13.580]   the one success story kind of one of two of um orchid
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:19.660]   Brazil is unsung for being ahead on every internet trend nobody pays attention
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.780]   Well, it's a massive
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.020]   population big country
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.140]   And very similar is on google. No, that makes sense
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.020]   I wonder though this is because so this could almost make google like kind of um
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.060]   It wouldn't be twitter, but it'd be the part of twitter that celebrities and brands used to
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:41.900]   Kind of broadcast what they're up to. I mean we use twitter that way. We'll say
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.540]   You know this week in google is coming up things like that on our at twitter account
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:52.540]   This is interesting. I think this is something google isn't looking at maybe they could kind of become the next twitter in a more
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.380]   uh
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:06:00.140]   Responsible fashion. What do you think that I question you lose the conversation. There's no conversation at all. It's all broadcast
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:08.300]   That's why they like it better. No one can answer right? No one no one can complain to you and engage you
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:13.580]   Oh, you know, I think it has a place to I mean for me. It's one in the same
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:18.940]   It's the conversation and the broadcast but for like for a lot of entities and even people
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:24.060]   Just having a broadcast medium is probably really relevant. I mean there's a timeliness that needs to happen
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.780]   With search results
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.780]   That makes sense. Yeah, especially in like a always on kind of live streaming world
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:37.100]   So it's very interesting and how will you feel when you get those results in your search
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:44.620]   So you search for value. Yeah, I think so you search for you know a team at kansas city royals and you get oh and by the way
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:51.180]   We're playing tonight or whatever. Yeah, we're playing tonight. We need to sell, you know, we've discounted our seats
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:55.580]   Yeah, you know that would be valuable. Oh, if you're searching for that brand that would be valuable
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.620]   I mean like spotify kind of does this they they let you know if you play an artist
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:07.500]   They're like hey by the way this artist is playing near you and I like that feature a lot see and that's that's awesome. That's useful
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:11.340]   Yeah, okay, so do it google. We give you our approval
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:18.540]   That does it down people don't have to use it that way, but it'd be a good way to use it. I think
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:24.380]   Let's take a break more to come stacy higgin bothoms here from stacy on iot
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.580]   the iot podcast calm

[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:05.020]   Our show today brought to you by my mattress. I'm gonna get some more caspers. I am such a fan of the gasper mattress
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.260]   I have become a
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.020]   An evangelizer for casper and my own you know family and friends
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.460]   When they say oh I didn't sleep well last night. I said you need a casper
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.300]   Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.220]   For a fraction of the cost, but I'm not even gonna focus on how you save money. You're gonna love this mattress
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:28.700]   This is a amazing mattress. They spend a lot of time
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:31.420]   engineering the perfect sleep experience
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:37.980]   It's made of supportive memory foams. There are no springs forget the spring forget the lump
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:41.500]   You know how lumpy mattresses, you know with the spring forget that
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.140]   They're never a lump
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:49.500]   This it's just the right sink, but but it but it's firm too. It's just right bounce
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.060]   I don't know how it's kind of a best to both worlds
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:57.420]   It's breathable design means you'll sleep cool as we get warmer and warmer months can be in the 80s here next week
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.100]   You're gonna want a cool sleeping mattress
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.980]   So you're you know you're regga even you know even when it's winter I get hot sometimes tonight
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:11.900]   It's nice to have a mattress that breathes and by the way, it smells great right out of the box comes in a surprisingly compact box
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.220]   So it's easy to move in
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:20.140]   It's gonna give you a long lasting comfort and support you can buy it online and here's the most important thing
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:25.020]   It is completely risk free because if at any time in the first hundred nights you say
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:31.580]   Yeah, I I'm not it's I'm not a fan. You call them career. I'll come take it away from you and refund you every penny
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   So you there is no risk
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.420]   They do that because they don't have a showroom and they know you're gonna want to try before you buy
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   But they also do that because they know and I bet I don't know the figures are but nobody says no once you try the gasper
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:48.700]   You go, okay, it won't take you a hundred nights in about two nights you go. Okay. Why did I wait?
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:55.820]   I hear from people all the time not just family and friends but on twitter and everywhere people saying I love this

[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:29.740]   Alright Stacey was it something exciting? I got a toy
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.820]   Ooh, this this is the
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:38.540]   Hold on it is the skybell. Oh trim
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:44.940]   It is trim, isn't it now I had a skybell before we got ring and rings a sponsor their competitor
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:48.380]   Um, but I tried somebody called me and said I was having trouble with skybell
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:52.540]   So I ordered one on the radio show so I ordered one just to try and I never got it working either
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.540]   But they've got I guess they've gotten better
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:11:01.660]   And I have to say that looks good. You like you like your skybell. I do. Well, so I did um and I'm doing I'm re
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:07.420]   Re I'm updating it not re updating it. I did the doorbell thing for the wirecutter. So I did
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.340]   Ring. Oh good. Yes, you better say you you better not say you don't like the ring
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.940]   It was my number two choice. Okay, but you skybell was your number one choice
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.980]   Skybell was my number one choice because at the time
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:27.100]   Ring didn't have HD support and when I initially started and this changed it it moved it up actually
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:33.900]   It didn't have a live view. Right. It does. Yeah. Yeah, so that that moved it. But well, you know, it's great
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.980]   It's a very competitive space
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.900]   It is uh and these both these companies have demonstrated a real market here. So that's good
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:45.100]   We're gonna see improvements. Yeah. Oh, you want an update? This is an IOT update
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.580]   So you guys may not care so much. We need a song for that
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:53.500]   IOT update been working on the railroad
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:58.620]   What is the update for ring folks? They actually just
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.420]   They did not buy but
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:08.620]   There was a company in philadelphia called zonoff that is a systems integrator behind the staples connect hub that is now defunct
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.980]   um
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:15.020]   samphe's takoma home system and a bunch of other connected products well
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:22.060]   Samphe ran into some problems an acquisition it wanted it was going forward fell through so ring hired
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:27.420]   All 80 of the zonoff employees and now has a new philadelphia office
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:34.460]   And they're gonna the reason they did it is because they're gonna really focus on their integrations with other products. So yay
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.940]   Oh, there it is
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:41.660]   Did didn't did ring not just announce new uh hardware too. They're doing something else new
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:44.460]   I feel like they're branching out. They're the ring
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:51.980]   The ring doorbell the skinny doorbell is coming my way. They also have an outdoor camera. Yeah, we've mentioned that in the ads
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.620]   And they have a the light
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.260]   Is it a four headlight? This is the two security lights
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:03.740]   You're heard here. Oh, the lights are new. They didn't have those before all right
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:12.860]   So they're they're doing stuff. They have a lot of investment capital. So yeah, they just raised 109 million at the end of january
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.940]   Yeah, they're they're gonna be well positioned
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:18.540]   They're going for that ipo. So we'll see
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.140]   Exciting here comes. Oh
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:30.300]   Nougat is already being eclipsed. The next version of android is coming into beta android. Oh
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.180]   Takes all the suspense on it
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.180]   Well, do we know what it's called?
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.180]   Oh mg. We do not
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.980]   Oh
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.260]   Oreo jokes have been made. Oreo would make sense
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:46.300]   Um
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.140]   Oh
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.740]   I don't know
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.740]   uh better battery life
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.500]   What's new in oh, here's where it's new in oh background limits building on the work we began in nougat
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.460]   Android o puts a big priority improving battery life that is actually the biggest thing
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:06.380]   That I would say andra needs to work on compared to ios
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.180]   Uh, because ios is very good at about
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.740]   very aggressive about killing background
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:16.780]   Tasks and as a result gets very very good battery life on much less battery
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.900]   Um, the way you if you're an android device you handle this is just by putting in big old batteries
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:26.780]   So there are automatic limits in oh and what apps can do in the background
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:31.740]   Uh in three main areas implicit broadcast background services and location updates
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:37.820]   This will make it easier says google to create apps that have minimal impact on a user's battery
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:45.340]   Notification channels these are new app defined categories for notification content
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.580]   Channels let developers give users fine gain grain control
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:55.820]   Over different kinds of notifications. So in the past all you've been able to do is say I don't want a notification from you
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.220]   Now you'll be able to say I want this kind but not that kind
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:03.020]   That's good right
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:09.820]   New visuals and grouping to notifications and make it easier for users to see what's going on auto fill apis
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.580]   So I use last pass for auto fill, which is awesome
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.700]   But this will make a standard operating system wide
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.220]   Auto fill api available to apps
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:27.580]   So they won't have to kind of do you know last pass you have to turn on stuff and things
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.380]   I have to kind of do a accessibility work around and stuff
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:36.700]   So this that's this is welcome news. That means your password manager will be better at auto filling in passwords
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.420]   picture in picture
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:44.460]   So you know we already have that with youtube right when you're watching a youtube video it can
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.980]   Go down into a little thumbnail as you do other applications
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:54.700]   Um, there's a new app overlay window for apps to use instead of a system alert window and a multi display support
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:58.380]   Actually, I think this is going to be interesting from the split screen
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.540]   Yeah
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:07.340]   Oh, that's that's good for tab. Oh wait. No, it's handsets. Okay. Multi display support is interesting because in you're seeing this already
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.380]   Uh windows phone has it it's called and I what's it called?
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:19.580]   Because of the sea I can't remember but uh the idea is that your phone is going to be your computer
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:25.980]   And if you can plug it into display and keyboard suddenly it's a full-size computer and these phones are so powerful now
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.780]   I think this is going to be a big category in the years to come
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.140]   So you don't have more than one computer you have one device
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:37.420]   That can be a desktop or a lab time earlier conversation you go abroad and you rent
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.220]   It's creating a keyboard and this is your computer. Right?
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.260]   I'm guessing but that sounds like
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:52.060]   Multi display support for launching an activity on a remote display. That sounds maybe not maybe more. This is more like Chromecast. I don't know
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.340]   Font resources and xml
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:59.340]   Adaptive icons to help you integrate better with the device ui
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.220]   mm-hmm
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.820]   This is for developers wide color wide gamut color for apps
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.460]   Uh
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:14.060]   Newer. Oh, this is good new bluetooth audio codecs like LDAC. I'm not familiar with LDAC
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:19.980]   New Wi-Fi features like Wi-Fi aware previously known as neighbor awareness networking or NAN
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:25.100]   With the appropriate hardware apps and nearby devices
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:31.180]   Can discover and communicate over Wi-Fi without an internet access point. Oh
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:34.380]   Interesting sort of ad hoc
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.100]   Oh, oh ad hoc networking. Yeah
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.140]   Oh, I like that
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:43.980]   I used to run serval so we could do ad hoc networking, but no one else ran it
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:51.340]   So yeah, this sounds like it'll be built in and built into andrado. Oh, that is so nerdy awesome nerdy awesome
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:56.780]   I think that I mean yeah, think about that for like protests, but also think about what you could do from a
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.540]   from a
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:03.900]   Community standpoint or just even conferences. Oh so fun. Okay, nice
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.700]   I like it
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.860]   keyboard navigation
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:14.700]   Arrow and tab navigation a audio api for pro audio
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.700]   This is something that's really been a problem in the past on andrado
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.900]   Actually, I'm glad to see they're addressing this and it wasn't really andrades fault
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:27.820]   It was because of the kernel they were using but latency on andrado was too high to for really professional music apps
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.020]   So there is a new a audio
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.180]   api that will
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.860]   Have a high performance low latency audio streams
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:42.860]   That's very interesting for musicians, you know, that's why there's not a lot of great music apps on andrado
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:47.180]   Um
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.340]   web view enhancements java 8
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:57.260]   partner platform this uh big some big big changes but not not so much ui changes as a kind of
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.380]   api change and I think isn't that kind of
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.660]   I feel like that's what google said is that uh
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:10.780]   They're going to do a tick-tock thing where they update the interface and then they update under the hood and they update the interface in the next one
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:14.540]   Maybe i'm maybe i'm mistaken that was somebody else, but that would make sense
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:19.500]   I really should talk to all these iot companies about how they plan to
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:26.460]   How how they plan to implement and update their android on the back end for all of their devices that are running versions of android
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:30.780]   Because a lot of them don't spend a lot of time on that right i think
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:36.860]   Well, they do but do they do do ios is that why is it like that's the platform of choice
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:42.700]   No, they they build their stuff on android on android. Oh, oh, yeah, i was gonna have june oven
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:51.340]   Your june is right june is android. That's right. Um, there's other things. I think the nucleus conference call conference system thing is built on android
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:55.820]   So interesting there's a it's out there. It's open. Yeah, it's free
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.700]   it's free
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:07.980]   Article by uh, andy greenberg and wired saying there's good news half of all android devices have gotten fairly recent security patches
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.060]   The bad news is half of android devices haven't
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:16.220]   uh, but he he says that uh
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:21.500]   In its annual report on security, uh, that google released this week
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:28.060]   Um, the company says and i think they're probably right android security is getting better less malware in the play store
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.020]   devices more often encrypted than not
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:36.700]   Uh, and more hackers than ever report android bugs to google for bug bounties instead of
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:40.220]   Selling them to the highest bidder in the private market
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:44.060]   Or giving them to the cia
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.220]   Um
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:50.940]   He also writes google's released solid data for the first time on android's most serious nagging security problem
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:56.540]   The challenge of getting dozens of manufacturers and hundreds of carriers around the world to patch
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:02.300]   Their phones so 50 percent is a lot better than before still obviously
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.020]   Only halfway there
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.060]   Um
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:09.820]   But it's kind of way it's going to be hard on those cheap old phones to get those patched
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:17.820]   I liked the effort they've put into the google play store like all the all the security efforts they've put around that and monitoring
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:23.660]   Yes for crappy devices. I feel like they're doing a very good job on an operating system that really is open
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:27.180]   And and perhaps a little more vulnerable because of it
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.020]   I think I don't feel insecure on my android device to you
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:36.700]   I don't want to say I don't because then someone will be like I accept your challenge
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.180]   except
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.860]   How about you
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.580]   Uh, no, I but I but I use I mean a pixel I feel like because i'm using a pixel
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:51.020]   I'm I'm as safe as android can be and I feel like it's secure enough. I really do. Yeah, no, I do. Yeah
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.100]   So, oh on this
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:59.340]   If you play the summary video for about two minutes in the 30 minute long video
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.140]   You hear kevin
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.220]   Oh
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:08.860]   I'm trying to see if he's oh, nope. That's not him. Do they do they give him uh?
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:13.100]   Nope, you just hear his voice. Oh, no credit, huh?
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:18.860]   What is he saying? He's talking about uh actually security and the android play store
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.620]   That's his he he's he's the voice behind
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:28.300]   The you they have a it's a year in review. Hi. My name is Aaron Ludwig. Hi, Aaron
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:34.940]   The android security team here at google. Hi. How you doing? Just this week. We released our 2016 year in review
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.820]   so um
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:43.500]   Where where am I where am I gonna see this how far i'm looking i'm scrolling i'm scrolling
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:47.900]   Oh wait, is that it? Oh, so it looks like somewhere in
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:51.020]   13 minutes in maybe all right
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.980]   Uh 13 13 13 13 is where you see it
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:59.660]   This is pretty good 80 percent encryption rate is if is that's impressive that yeah, that is that's really good
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.460]   um
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:07.980]   Protection that gets more powerful every second. It's coming android developer uploads their app to google play
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:13.820]   A self-learning app risk analyzer scans and simulates apps looking for potential security
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:18.460]   Voice that's he has a very nice voice. It's very friendly. That's why he's my co-host
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.660]   Oh really not because of his brains or his good looks
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:27.900]   No, it's just his voice. Yes because of his nice voice. That's the audio fixing
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.540]   nice voice
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:34.860]   1.4 billion android users
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:40.220]   That's that's another takeaway from this report 1.4 billion
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:47.820]   Instagram this this week announced they have 400 million daily active users big growth for instagram by the way
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:52.220]   That's and that's i think mostly at the expensive snap i would guess
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.740]   I always liked instagram
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.740]   I have to say i use it less now because of the stories i don't it's purely psychological because you can just use it as you
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.140]   Always did just scroll past them, but those videos
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:08.060]   They're there they're begging me to click on them and i don't want to
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:16.220]   That's a revenue model for many publications leo. It's how they're targeting the young's the young's that's how we get the young's
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:21.020]   It's the youth the youth. I can't believe I screwed that up. No young's is good. I like young's
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:25.580]   You just created your own thing my own words. I like you it's too
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:27.660]   Yachts
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:31.980]   Um, yeah, I I am on instagram primarily to follow people who have core geese
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.020]   A very good kind of dog. What what are they? What kind of dog do you have?
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:40.380]   I don't have core geese, but um, I have a I have a mutt
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:45.100]   Who is cute because they have short legs and big jet butts
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:49.340]   And they have the way we're gonna meet your dog. They wangle them and little pointy. Oh, do you?
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:52.140]   If you want to meet my dog, we just your dog
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:56.540]   Right now just the jeff do you have a ups costume shows over
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.260]   I was like, okay. Yeah, just get your just put your brown shorts on jeff
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:05.180]   You don't want to see that
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:11.980]   No, we don't I actually have brown shorts. I have a ups costume in my closet over here
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.140]   I should put it on next week. I'll wear my ups costume. It's a long story
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:21.500]   Like you know what those those are not questions. You actually want to know the answer to jeff by the way
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:27.740]   Why do you have a ups costume? Excuse me ma'am. I have a delivery for you. I have a delivery
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:37.740]   Did we did we talk about on any of our shows because this is something congress is considering this week the fcc
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.900]   Are these are these makes me mad? Is this gonna pass? This makes me so mad
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:51.100]   I don't know. I I want it not to pass. It feels like how could this this is so directly anti-consumer. I I just don't understand
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.260]   Okay
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.180]   So, uh, thanks to send her jeff flake aptly named
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:01.500]   uh
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.940]   the their
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.380]   tonight
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.060]   the senate
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.180]   will be
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:08.860]   voting on a measure
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.500]   That's actually a resolution of disapproval
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:20.140]   So that it wouldn't be an affirmative measure. It is just to overturn the existing fcc privacy order
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:24.140]   That prevents internet service providers from selling your data
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:26.860]   your surfing history
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.500]   For instance to advertisers
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:33.020]   protecting your privacy
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.300]   They're
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.780]   So up here's an update from reco the senate voted tonight to begin debating the measure
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:44.940]   Putting lawmakers on track for a final vote to roll back the fcc rules tomorrow
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:49.500]   If it's in the senate that means this has already passed the house or is it only the senate that needs to know?
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.380]   No either way. Okay. Yeah
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.380]   Lawmakers there prevail
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.340]   tomorrow
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:27:00.220]   tomorrow, okay, uh, of course the house would rubber stamp it because
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:02.620]   the house
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.660]   Then the fcc's privacy rules would be wiped from the books
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:10.860]   And who and who likes this idea? Well guess verizon
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:14.700]   And this is both
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.900]   Wireless and wired
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.900]   Everybody so this is this is anybody who's providing you a pipe to the internet
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:27.420]   Can take your in right now for example google doesn't take your data
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:32.540]   I know people like when google fiber came out people were like, uh, i'm not getting my internet through google
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.580]   They're gonna look at what i'm doing and google is like heck no, we're not
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:38.140]   Um, so this would actually
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.340]   How does this do anything but just hand
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.420]   uh
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:47.660]   Over our information to people who give congress money to you know to run
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:50.540]   I mean this is the r&b consumer
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.980]   It is the argument from isp's is
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   Twofold one is sort of legit in the sense that their life is a little challenging at the moment
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.580]   And the other is blatantly not legit
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:08.620]   So the legit argument is because of a ruling a federal court ruling in the ninth district
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:16.140]   Some states have different privacy rules different rules governing how isp's can govern can use your information than others
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:25.260]   So the idea is doing it at a federal level makes more sense because you know state by state regulations for a nationwide provider suck, right?
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:32.620]   So that obviously the isps are like, oh, well, yeah, we need we need to take all the rules away
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:37.020]   This is terrible. It's very difficult to enforce some privacy rules in some states and not in others so
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.420]   This by the way
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:44.140]   If approved by the house and the senate would effectively permanently ban
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.780]   the fcc from ever writing any privacy rules
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.980]   and uh according to the eff
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.940]   The federal trade commission is already barred from policing internet service providers
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:03.420]   So in other words, there would be nobody at the federal level protecting your privacy online
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.940]   Nope. Nope. Nope. And remember so a while back atnt let people
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:15.340]   Let they offered a cheaper version of their gigabit plan for people who gave up their privacy
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:19.260]   And a lot of people did that because it was freaking expensive to avoid
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:25.340]   Because well, no, no, it was not fair the fcc actually was investigating that
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:30.860]   Um, and then edgy pie became the chairman of the fcc and that's no longer on the table
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.540]   I think I mean i'm willing to compromise that seems like at least you're giving that no, why not?
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.020]   No, because that a bad idea
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:43.420]   One they were not transparent about how much you have to pay
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:50.540]   So it wasn't just a discount. It was you you paid more over time for your privacy two
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:57.420]   You only have a choice of two broadband providers in some places you only have a choice of one and
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.780]   Yeah, and so charging people for keeping their privacy is inherently
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.420]   I it's inherently anti-consumer
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.620]   Especially if they don't have any other course
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.980]   Clear with the senate is going to vote tomorrow on
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:21.900]   overturning rules that prevent Comcast and AT&T and Verizon and your internet service provider from selling your private information
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:28.380]   To the highest bidder and you know people are so upset. We hear about it all the time. Oh google. Oh facebook
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:32.860]   No one knows more about what you do online than your internet service provider
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.460]   Yeah, this includes the websites that you go to
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:42.860]   This includes when you're online it includes data on how many devices you have online
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:48.220]   Here's the key here's the absolute key of this is that is that much of what you do online has no pii
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:50.940]   You're cooking your phone company
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:54.380]   And your ISP have your name and your address
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.100]   Right personally identifiable in the extreme
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:01.500]   Uh, that's a big difference. I mean if you go back to the days when when we didn't have digital we had magazines
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:06.140]   Axiom had all kinds of data on you. They still have kinds of data on you
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:11.180]   Tied your name much of what we can play about online is anonymous, but this stuff is not
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:15.980]   And oh, I should also mention in case you guys were wondering
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:24.460]   On the ISP side here is also the American association of advertising agencies the American advertising federation the data in marketing
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:28.940]   Of course, they're the ones we're gonna sell the information to
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:34.780]   So, uh, this is terrible everyone should call their senator
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.780]   Yes
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.780]   And explain to them
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:41.340]   I don't work for a big company. I work for you
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:45.500]   Stunning that they that they would eve I mean this is just
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.340]   We don't care about consumers at all
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:54.620]   We are in the pockets of the people who pay for our campaigns period
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:01.660]   Well, and there's a lot of sensitive information that you have I mean in in the past so atnt when it did it's it's
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.940]   Original plan it's gigabit plan for
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:10.700]   Uh, that used your your website surfing for giving you ads
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:17.340]   They did it in a way that it protected like sensitive information, which is medical information and etc, but
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:22.140]   We don't necessarily have those guarantees and
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:29.420]   So here let watch this this is if you now some of this is probably over the top, but this is what the eff says
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:33.660]   Overturning these rules would allow an internet service provider to do
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:36.780]   Sell your data to marketers. Okay. Well
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:41.580]   Yeah, obviously that's the number one thing, but it's not limited to that
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:44.780]   They could also hijack your searches
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:51.980]   Well, they do that already with dns redirects. That's right put ads in your search results even if you're using google
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:57.260]   They could snoop through your traffic and insert ads
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:01.420]   By the way atnt charter and cma have all done this
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:03.420]   They have
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:06.780]   They all have done this and they were stopped
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:12.780]   Remember a nebud inform we talked about this a lot on uh security now a couple of years ago
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.660]   Well, they had to stop
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:18.140]   But they actually had start again
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:24.300]   Freshional hearings about this in the people the congressmen at the hearings a
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.620]   Stunned me with their
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:28.620]   Lickner it's about tracking
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:34.220]   But well fainter real fainter real by the way some it might be real because some of them are just ignorant
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:40.540]   Some of them are are being a little disingenuous standing. Yes. Yes. That is well. Whatever do you mean?
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:45.260]   Uh you're telling me that you could
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:51.500]   Use these little bugs and tracking devices to follow whatever I'm doing on the internet
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.300]   Whatever do you mean?
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:57.580]   Wow, you're southern
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:00.860]   I say I say son
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:06.380]   So
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:12.940]   They could also
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:21.020]   Preinstall software on your phone and record every url you visit. Oh, no, no do that. No just att and sprint and mobile t mobile
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:24.140]   Um
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:32.060]   Remember carrier iq we talked about that on security now an application that came pre-installed and phones sold by atnt sprint and t mobile
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:38.460]   Logged all the sites and apps you use and sent it right back to your ISP who now can use it for all sorts of things
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:43.260]   And to be clear all of these companies have now installed deep packet inspection
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:48.380]   Which is what these services the services that these guys were selling way back in 2008 and 2010
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:53.740]   So all of the carriers have dpi on their networks already. They're just not using it for this
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:58.300]   So this is not like a big investment. This is like just scraping money off the table
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:04.940]   Any more so so yeah, same more about that. So there so deep packet inspection basically
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:12.860]   Is a tool that lets you see like what types of traffic and where it's coming from so that's how it does right?
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.020]   well, it's
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:21.500]   In some ways it provides a service to the carrier like you know that oh my god youtube traffic is going through the roof
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.820]   I need to allocate more
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.780]   Bandwidth not really bandwidth but ports for those service
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:29.420]   It helps you plan your network
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.100]   but it also
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.100]   can tell you that I spend 15 hours a day on youtube and
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.180]   you know
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.140]   See what websites I go to so
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:45.660]   That's already in place. They don't they don't need to buy a new stuff necessarily to do this
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:47.740]   This is easy to implement. No in fact
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:52.060]   You know every one of these five things they've done them in the past and they stopped because of blowback
[01:35:52.060 --> 01:36:00.380]   But there ain't gonna be no blowback anymore Verizon used to put remember those cookies you couldn't kill you couldn't turn off
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:06.780]   Super cookies right tracking headers into all your all your day remember you couldn't and it didn't matter if you
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:12.300]   Turned on do not track and the thing that our audience has told us time and time again
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:16.460]   I've even had to fight with them because they're so adamant that we don't want this kind of
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.660]   snooping
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:22.300]   And and they blame google and they blame facebook
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:28.780]   But this is going to happen at where you live it's going to happen through your internet service provider far worse
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.900]   So if you have a vpn
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:37.820]   Does that would help in fact that's one solution right is to stop
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:43.100]   Don't trust your uh the problem is you know there's overhead and it slows your traffic down a lot
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.340]   But if you use a vpn
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.420]   Well, you're you're moving trust along down the pipe. You're no longer trusting your ISP
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:51.900]   You're you're encrypting all your traffic from your computer
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:55.980]   Of course whoever's at the other end of that vpn you have to trust them
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.380]   uh, you know, so your vpn provider now becomes the
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.340]   Your entry onto the internet city or ISP
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:08.700]   I just I just this is so you know frustrating
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:13.260]   So that was my second story and I that was why I brought it up because i'm like oh my god guys
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.660]   We can do something about this. I blew it
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:19.340]   Yeah, we have to do something now because we should have been beating this drum for at least a week
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.180]   Because i mean we've known about this going on
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.780]   But now it's it's deadly earnest go to eff.org and go to the take action page
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:29.660]   call your member of congress
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:34.300]   Call your uh your senator or how house member
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:41.740]   Email email not as good calls the best snail males good too. It's easy to call them and just register
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:46.620]   Uh, you're you're the real thing is in absence of hearing from us
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:50.940]   They're going to go where the money is but the money is only useful to them to the by votes
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.980]   And if the voters are bell and we've seen this happen before
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:57.980]   With internet regulation if enough people contact them they do pay attention
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:05.740]   So contact them. It's not a done deal used to in the old days. I don't know now all the rules are off. I know we don't know what's going stop
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:07.500]   everything
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.780]   Yeah
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:09.740]   Guys
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:16.300]   Have you ever gotten a notification from your google app about a new product being available based on your search history? Oh dear
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.500]   Because i just got one telling me
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:26.380]   Oh, what did you get what no what what google app you mean what you're in google now cards? What google now cards just
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:30.700]   Popped up to let me know and they send a notification which they don't usually do
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:37.020]   Um to tell me that taylor swift has a new album out. Well, you would you do want to know?
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:41.340]   My daughter wants to know that yeah, but it's it's actually
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:43.900]   I would get that because I have bought that for my daughter
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:47.660]   I don't think now. Okay. This is kind of like the beating the beast. Oh, though less so
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:52.140]   You've indicated you've shown through signals that you're interested in taylor swift
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:56.780]   This is doing you sir if you really are interested you would like to know she's got a new album going out right? Yeah
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:01.820]   Google now cards so it can be my cards. I don't really want the notification
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.660]   Yeah, that's an extra level. I'm gonna see it
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.380]   What are the rules about?
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:10.700]   Notifications from google now
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:13.900]   I don't think they can you turn those off
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:17.980]   Well, I don't want to turn all of them off because I love when it bings me and says hey
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.980]   Leave now to get to your appointment. Yeah, that's really useful. Mm-hmm. Yeah
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:27.500]   It doesn't ping me on like package notifications. It doesn't ping. There's a lot of things it doesn't tell me
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:30.300]   Nah, I get a lot of packages
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.540]   It pings you got that's what you got the dog for anyway, right?
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:40.140]   Um, it tells you when the weather is going to be different, but other than that it usually doesn't notify me of things
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.860]   I don't know. Sorry. I do hope google's not going to get more aggressive on that
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:51.180]   That would be disappointing. Okay. Actually, this is less important than then it is less important
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:54.220]   It is but it's all of a p it's all of a piece isn't it?
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:59.020]   It's it's how our stuff can start using you using us
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:04.140]   Against ourselves or something. Yes. Oh, here's the problem I have
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:11.260]   Just that I believe that the future of media is about relationships annoying people and this is going to give it all kudos
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:13.100]   And it's it's going to go too far
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:18.140]   Which is just what it's just happening and then we'll never be allowed to know anybody you have in may
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.780]   2016
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:24.380]   The gdpr. I think it's called the general data private privacy
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:27.020]   general gd privacy
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.060]   Regulation
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.020]   You think it may oh my god. I just learned all about this
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.580]   Yes
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:40.860]   Into everything you have to opt into breathing everything everything and you know what's the scariest?
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:43.020]   This is going to be huge you guys
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:51.260]   The penalties are $20 million or 4% of your revenue for each indication. That's right. That's huge
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:54.060]   If you know those test cases
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:41:00.380]   I think this is I this is this is going too far in the other direction though like that stupid
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:06.860]   EU cookie thing which now every site you go to it says we use cookies, you know, and it's like that is so
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:13.980]   Yeah, and then you say okay, and it's like how much money and time is wasted on that
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:18.540]   I just oh I think this is the wrong search for gdpr and google just search for it
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:23.660]   And look at the look at the number of paid as a come up beginning for for compliance
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:27.420]   Yeah, this is a big company's gonna spend a lot of money on this
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.740]   general protection general data protection regulation
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.940]   So to put that in perspective because I think it's important to have a little perspective here
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:45.340]   COPPA which is the rus version for uh children's online privacy and protection act I think is
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.660]   background
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:53.980]   If you violate that it's a $40,000 fine up to a $40,000 fine per instance
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:57.900]   Compared to a $20 billion fine per instance
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.460]   so
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:05.260]   And people and by the way definition of personal data
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:11.100]   uh name photo email address bank details posts on social networking websites
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.740]   So your posts there
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:17.020]   So what do you think or a computer ip address?
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:22.860]   So this is kind of the opposite of what we're about to do in the united state. Yes, which which is better
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:26.940]   Well somewhere in the middle and a middle would be nice
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:29.820]   Oh, the challenge is actually
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:38.060]   If an american goes to europe all of this matters if they're in the EU they become presumably affected by this is how people are reading it
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:41.580]   And if a european is over here, so it's not just
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:47.260]   I'm in europe. I'm governed by this. It's I'm a european or i'm in europe
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:52.380]   I'm governed by this so I was talking to someone who was concerned about like if I scan a europeans badge at my trade show
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:55.100]   And I want to market to them. Wow. What does that mean for me?
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.580]   so
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.900]   Our well it's really what a contrast
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:04.700]   Between what what the EU is doing and what we're doing
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:09.900]   Uh, that's that's you couldn't have more polar opposites
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:17.020]   I don't know. I I feel like the EU is going too far. Yes. I think
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:20.860]   Oh, yeah
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.340]   Data subjects under the age of 16. This is like kappa
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:29.340]   um rental consent will be required to process the personal data of children under the age of 16 for online services
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:31.500]   That means your IP address
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:40.060]   I can't store your IP. I can't keep it. I'm just wondering how yeah, how does this removal of the fcc privacy rules kind of
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:44.300]   Melled with kappa because my child is on my
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:47.420]   Oh kappa's just not undermine kappa
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:52.940]   I mean part of this is coming from the fact that congress doesn't like the fcc getting involved in this kind of stuff
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:59.340]   But congress made the rules with kappa congress is not saying we can't make the rules only the fcc can make rules
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.740]   Right, but kappa still applies
[01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:09.420]   If i'm an isp I could you not make the argument that you know those internet searches were by my 10 year old
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.580]   Yeah, how does the isp know right?
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:16.620]   I mean they can say could assume it's from a device, but you know, that's interesting. Hmm
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.860]   By the way, you would have to you would be bound by this
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:24.620]   Stacey if you're in the united states collecting the information
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.260]   About an eu resident
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:31.500]   There you go. You don't have to be in the eu or use equipment in the eu or anything
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.460]   Well, you have to offer services to
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:41.740]   Anybody in the world is now subject to this right which is my my lowest common denominator or break of a freedom highest common denominator
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.900]   Of regulation problem
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:49.420]   It not just opens the door for china saying no, no, no if anybody can see you you're gonna follow our rules too
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:54.860]   Well, this will give trump, you know much fodder if he if he looks into that
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:59.100]   He won't understand it
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:02.060]   Man does not use a computer. No, I'm
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:07.740]   Cyber is out of his hand cyber is out of his car. Yeah, well, yeah
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:18.140]   Although although I mean you have to you have to think that what congress with the senate is about to do tonight is as a result of a shift in the united states government
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.700]   toward
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:24.060]   Corporate interests and away from individual interests
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:30.060]   Yes, and that's that's definitely the result of the of the last election. Yes
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:39.020]   Sorry, I've forgotten my decryption password. Nope
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:42.060]   You're going to jail
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:49.260]   You cannot claim that you forgot your passphrase. That would be the u.s. Third circuit court of appeals
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:54.460]   I'm doomed says oh god. That's contempt of court
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:57.180]   That's gonna go to is that appeals for it?
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:01.740]   This is the appeal supreme supreme court has to decide it's gotta go to the supreme's
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:06.620]   An ex cop claimed he couldn't remember the password to decrypt his hard drive
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:11.660]   Uh, which which they believe has child porn right a lower court said
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:17.900]   Said nope contempt of court third circuit today upheld actually two days ago upheld
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:22.940]   Um, so and and by the way in doing so
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:30.780]   Avoided addressing the lower court's rejection of the defendant's argument the being forced to reveal his password violated his fifth amendment protection against
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:35.260]   Self-incrimination so they didn't specifically address that
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:42.620]   They just said it's it's willfully disobeying and resisting the order to decrypt the hard drive on his mac pro
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:47.180]   Uh, is is contempt and can he can be held in contempt
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:54.380]   Now this is a cop. I wonder x cop how far x cop okay, right? Um
[01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:57.260]   From a journalistic if she
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:03.020]   But the evidence of stuff that had the hash passing through the computer
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:08.620]   Forensic examination the computer indicated the device had been used to visit known child exploitation sites
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:13.340]   And to download thousands of files with the same hash values as known child porn files
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:19.980]   The files were not present on the computer. They are assumed to be stored on external encrypted hard drives
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:26.540]   I we should just I would like to leave the child porn out of this because that really colors the whole thing because nobody yes
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.460]   You know everybody we all acknowledge horrendous crime. Nobody's for that
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.580]   Um on the other hand, we we would like the court
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:39.260]   Well, I don't know what we want the court to do in this case. Um, what do you think? Yeah
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:49.820]   He uh, the john doh will call him said he could not remember the passwords necessary to decrypt the drives and entered several incorrect passwords during the forensic examination
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.900]   Really the issue was the judge didn't believe him
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:48:01.260]   Well, the judge found that doh remembered the passwords needed to decrypt the hard drive but chose not to reveal them because of what it was was on there
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:06.140]   Uh in other words, the fifth amendment defense wasn't even addressed or acknowledged
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:11.340]   No, you have no fifth amendment protection to reveal the password on revealing the passwords
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:14.540]   That's also a big deal
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:21.340]   That is we've always held that a password was protected by the right against uh testimony against yourself
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:28.140]   There was it was believed that giving a password would be like testifying against yourself as opposed to giving a fingerprint which would not
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:39.740]   Staff attorney senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation says anytime suspects are forced to disclose disclose the contents of their mind
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:43.260]   That's enough to trigger the fifth amendment end of story
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.940]   um, but
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:54.300]   And that and in fact the ff filed in amicus brief, uh in with that point of view, uh
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:59.820]   However, so with a chrome book, how would you encrypt a thumb drive?
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:06.620]   Since you're not wearing a program, which you normally need right to encrypt? Yeah, I don't think uh, unless there's a
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:12.220]   Oh, I know there is a plugin you could use you couldn't encrypt the whole drive, but you can encrypt files using mini lock
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:14.780]   I think there's a chrome extension for mini law. Uh-huh
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:17.580]   Which is a good a very nice thing to know about
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:20.300]   You can encrypt folders
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:22.460]   Uh
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:24.460]   Files
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:29.740]   Do folders
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:32.460]   It goes back to our earlier conversation about crossing borders
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:39.180]   Right mini lock is awesome. Yeah, it's available in the chrome web store. So this is a chrome plugin you can use
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:42.060]   It uses a password
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:44.940]   And your email and hashes them together
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.180]   Uh, and you can share those in there in there unincryptable
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:52.860]   It also is uh, it's a public key crypto
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:58.380]   So I have given out for instance my mini lock hash my mini lock key
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:01.660]   And if anybody wanted to send me something encrypted
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:08.780]   Uh, they could uh, I said use my mini lock key to send me something encrypted and only I could decrypt it
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:13.020]   Mini lock.io free open source
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.860]   Highly recommended
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:16.860]   I don't know I should I wonder
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.500]   Chrome extension
[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:23.580]   For full descriptive, I don't think so that doesn't sound like something
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:27.420]   You could do
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.420]   But you certainly could do individual files anyway
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:32.460]   See we're already thinking about that
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:38.140]   It was exactly we're only thinking about that, but uh, but this court decision said, you know, you go you be in trouble because
[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:40.860]   We know you know the password
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:45.580]   I think that's assuming a lot, but I can I can prove
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:49.260]   I can take you to 30 places. I can't get into anymore
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:54.620]   Oh, you're old. Oh, you've did forget. Yeah, well, it unlike a web service
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:51:01.740]   A drive you can't just email someone to get your password right right? No, don't know it. I don't know it
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.380]   I think it's so weird. I
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:09.900]   That's a big judgment call on the part of the court that well you really do you know it you're just pretending you don't know it
[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:16.620]   Well, it's I mean I've I've definitely had arguments like that with my kid where I'm like, you know
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:23.900]   Who did this right? Nobody did you do this? Uh, I don't remember. Nope didn't really I didn't do it
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:29.180]   I didn't do it. I don't remember. I wasn't there at the time. I've never met that woman
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:34.380]   All right, um
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:40.060]   Let's let's wrap up so we can uh we can get out of dodge here. I just looking to see if there's anything
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.860]   else we want to
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:50.620]   Cover we're we'll be medium. So this is this is something you might want to know about okay
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:52.700]   Um
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:57.340]   So I don't look at the nails to yet, but I got an invitation to become a medium partner. Oh
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:00.060]   Adwilliam says
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:05.900]   Turned away advertising and is looking for new ways to monetize medium. Is this one is this part of that?
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:13.500]   So you can join as a paid member paid and then as a writer I can join and then here's the part that I'm not sure I like
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.380]   It says that people can always
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.380]   um post for free on medium
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:21.420]   definition of always these days who knows but um
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:28.380]   But then I can basically apply to have my stuff added into some evidently premium pool
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:31.580]   But you know, I don't I don't like editors
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.940]   I don't want editors
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.060]   I love editors editors make me unhappy
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:43.820]   So is that a requirement of being in the premium pool you have to have an editor
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:47.500]   Well, I don't want to well. I don't know if they edit you were not but if they pick
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:53.820]   So you can offer your stuff. I mean you'll give them your five dollars a month, but they don't guarantee you'll be in there
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:58.380]   Well, there's two different things that you I can belong as a reader at five dollars a month
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:00.460]   But I can I can belong as a writer
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:03.020]   And I'll get a piece of that
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.100]   uh based on I guess usage
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:10.700]   Um, I thought it was gonna be so you know somebody said we talked about this show when this all started coming down
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:15.820]   Somebody said the medium should just buy patreon and let you support the writers you like
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:23.260]   Mm-hmm, but they're gonna create basically some kind of uh as well as I read this as I understand there's like gonna create some kind of compilation
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:28.540]   Interesting so I don't know whether I you're not gonna do it
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:32.540]   I don't understand really everything. I mean medium
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:38.780]   Besides giving you a nice clean interface. It's really about a community, right? It's kind of
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:42.700]   Exactly. I get from it. Right. Yeah
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.500]   I'm not supposed to put it back on, you know buzz machine five bucks a month's not that much
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:50.540]   But for
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.540]   Here's the problem. What?
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:55.820]   There's no shortage of content people right
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:54:00.620]   Here I hear I talked earlier about the need for equality network and that's fine. But on the other hand
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:04.380]   There's no shortage. No shortage
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:11.740]   Well, we've been having Jason Kalecanis and marco armit and I have been having a twitter conversation today
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:14.300]   Jason said something interesting. He said, you know
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:19.100]   Somebody should do a Netflix style play with podcast content
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:26.060]   Create a Netflix, you know a five dollar month service that you subscribe to
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.020]   for premium content from audio content from podcasters
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:35.500]   as a way to kind of create a new model for podcasters
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:38.460]   and
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:42.140]   So it's kind of be kind of like medium, wouldn't it? Except instead of written word. It's audio
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:46.700]   60 db kind of count for something like that. Yeah, but you don't have to pay to be on 60 db
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.540]   You just have to be lucky enough for them to pick you
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:50.540]   Um
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.780]   So but but they could do it that way. I guess they could do that
[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:58.540]   Uh, I'm just thinking I think they're thinking about that among other monetization strategies
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:01.020]   um
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:03.020]   but I just I
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.020]   I like the idea being free
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:08.700]   Well, and you can I mean with voice it becomes really easy to
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:10.300]   kind of
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:14.460]   curate something that you like the like your podcast that you like
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:17.660]   So I I don't know
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:20.780]   I I don't I rarely go to the front page or medium though
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:26.220]   Uh, jeff, you know, so you don't really I don't think you'll get much of an advantage being on medium
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.980]   Uh, wait no
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:33.980]   Oh, well, so I've been on the front page of medium or and I know I've been an editor's pick one of my stories
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:35.660]   Did it go through the rules?
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:37.660]   Yes, it got like
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:41.340]   250 000 or 300 000 views, which jesus
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:47.180]   So the so it certainly gives you a jump start probably what happened is that you got more viral
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:49.660]   Because you were in a staff pick
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:54.140]   And then it kind of I mean that gave you a little jump start but that was enough to kind of stimulate the rest of it
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:57.420]   Which still comes you know all my content comes from links
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:59.820]   on twitter on facebook on
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.020]   on
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:04.540]   Tech meme congratulations to gabra vera and that nice article about tech meme
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.380]   um
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:09.820]   And so I just I so I only see stuff that other people link to nuzzle
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.900]   with nuzzles really great because that's
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:15.180]   Links that come from my twitter the people I follow on twitter
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:20.620]   So it's a it's a great newspaper of because I follow the right people people. I'm interested on twitter
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:22.460]   It's a great newspaper material
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:26.700]   They have a good algorithm and then a lot of times I do get to medium from that I get there from uh
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:28.700]   um
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:31.420]   Reddit the front page of reddit I get there from uh
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:34.140]   My combinators news
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.540]   Those are the beats checks I do I rarely I rarely go to the I always think
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:42.700]   I often think I should go to the front page of medium more often there's some good stuff on here
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:49.660]   There there is there's a lot but it's not really what we need. Uh the email that's that you see I I
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:54.220]   I'm the wrong person on that but everybody says oh email is the way to get ahold of it to reach the same here
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:57.260]   But I hate email I get too much of it. I never look at my email
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:01.180]   Sorry, it's no way ever newsletters. I just don't do it
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.860]   Is that it's gonna take over the world not for me?
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:09.500]   I have a filter my email filter says if there's unsubscribe the word unsubscribes in the bottom of any email put it in this folder which I never look at
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:14.540]   Wait, are you saying you're not subscribed to my newsletter you guys? I am but it's in the folder
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:17.100]   Oh
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   useless to me leo useless
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:25.660]   You are dead to me, but we're unusual I think right because everybody says oh no you want to reach people
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:28.540]   emails the best system for reaching people blah blah blah
[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:31.100]   And you you would vouch for that right stacy?
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:35.020]   Well, it's the best way to reach a certain type of audience
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:38.460]   So like I cover something pretty niche
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:43.340]   I've got a dedicated group of people who are like I really care about the internet of things and so
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:50.060]   I think it's valuable to them because they don't have to I bring them all the stuff right as opposed to
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.340]   Having them go out and find it so I think for some people
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:58.140]   But if you're like a general interest person and you subscribe to my newsletter, you're probably gonna open it and be like oh my god
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.220]   What the heck this too much iot?
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:05.580]   I just get so many newsletters that I just put them in the folder and I never read them
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:09.740]   I do the beat checks, you know, I mean I'm just I'm doing the beat checks
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:15.740]   I go to tech meme and all those sources and my feedleaf RSS reader and all that stuff
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:17.820]   That's how I find news hacker news
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:22.140]   And I find that much more useful than going so i'm interested in iot but i'd rather
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:28.220]   Just you know what I you know why this works because it's curate hacker news and tech meme. They're curated
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:30.860]   Nuzzled they're curated somebody else
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:34.940]   There's there's there's they're coletting signals from a bunch of people
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:42.060]   And whether it's hacker news so it's people I know who are interested in stuff. I am or that's what a newsletter is
[01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:45.660]   Yeah, but it's only curated by one person
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:51.980]   Okay, that's fair. I'm like this is curated by a this is the wisdom of the crowd
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:54.540]   Got it
[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:59.660]   The crowd right, you know, I said that's why I subscribed to your newsletter and and kevin rose is
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:04.220]   And I subscribed a bunch of really good newsletters. I just for some reason I never get around and reading them
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.900]   It's okay. I'm not I'm gonna go over there and cry
[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:10.700]   Sorry
[01:59:10.700 --> 01:59:13.260]   I really should come up with a new strategy what
[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:18.620]   Nick denton just uh tweeted two minutes ago. He's finally out of bankruptcy
[01:59:18.620 --> 01:59:21.500]   My decade
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.260]   is over
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.860]   I don't know what the rest is
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.340]   So other journals can pick up that particular chalice
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:30.380]   How did he get out of uh
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:33.660]   By the way, he's going to brazil now. How did he um
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:37.340]   We have a bankruptcy so fast
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:42.060]   Oh, this is that's such a fast. Oh wait, I'm looking at the old nickname
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:45.500]   When they sold gocker he had he had resources that he had to settle
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:48.860]   Everything right but they figured out a way to get this apartment or not
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:54.220]   Oh, so I must be because this is a nick denton uh tweet twitter thing, but he hasn't tweeted since 2007
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:58.300]   So this is this is his first twitter account. He's only got 13
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.300]   Nett
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:01.740]   10 nick what?
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:04.540]   Denton dot nad nick not nad nick not nad
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:11.020]   All right, well congratulations to the zurik
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:13.740]   Yeah, congratulations
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:16.540]   He's finally out of bankruptcy
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:25.100]   Wow my my decade-long involvement with petered teal is over. He's not holding any grudges
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:34.940]   Uh a couple of quickies before we uh before we wrap up uh kurt eichenwaldes
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:41.500]   harasser has been arrested kurt a uh columnist for vanity fair
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:48.940]   He's also epileptic. Oh, he has been sent tweets in the past with epic epicina epic genetic
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:51.180]   um
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:54.460]   Images designed to send him into a seizure
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:01:00.620]   Uh, they caught a guy who allegedly intentionally sent him a jiff
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:07.100]   Designed to provoke provoke a seizure and the way they caught him was kind of interesting uh, too. Oh that was interesting
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:08.700]   um
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:13.820]   So in after they caught him they read his direct messages in which he messaged other people
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:20.060]   I hope this sends him to a seizure. Let's see if he dies so that you know they got the smoking gum and gun in terms of intent
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:25.180]   um the way they got him he the the the alleged
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.500]   Twitter
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:29.500]   Was using a burner phone
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:35.980]   Actually, no, he was not using it. He was using a sim a burner sim that he got which was not associated in any way with his name
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:38.140]   but he put it in his iphone six
[02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:47.820]   and so uh the fbi got a warrant for twitter and got the uh the the sim information
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:51.100]   And then they which gave them the phone number
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:58.940]   And then they went to at no they went to apple went to apple with a phone number and said is this associated with any icloud accounts
[02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:01.580]   And apple said oh, yes. Yes. It definitely is. Here's the guy
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:05.420]   so even though he had a anonymous sim
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:12.940]   Because he used it in the iphone and it got attached to his ikloud account. They got him
[02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:16.300]   So just a tip if you want to harass somebody don't do that
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:20.220]   Anyway, I think this is great because that is that is
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:23.260]   I mean the more we can do to get rid of these harassers
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:25.260]   Uh the better
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:28.300]   This guy was not prime that just occurred leo was that you called it a jiff
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.940]   That's a it's a gif
[02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:36.060]   It's a gif. Yep. I know that the founder of gifts says jiff that I don't care
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:39.260]   I can't remember so I just usually I say gif or jiff
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:42.220]   I do both because I don't can't remember what the right answer is
[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:49.740]   But I do think it's it's it's a punchline too that that a gif is a deadly weapon. Yeah, um, you know, I
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:56.300]   Well, so here's my question because it's a doj one and then there's a grand jury indictment
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:02.460]   But grand juries are famous for indicting anything. So I'm like how serious says right? Yeah, how serious is this?
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:08.060]   Well, cyberstalking that's a serious crime. You can go to jail. Sorry. Sorry. Not the crime. Yes, not
[02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:14.860]   I'm just how legit is this to point to this as any sort of precedent setting. Sorry. Oh, he was in the hospital
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:17.820]   Uh, he was there. There's there's there's there's clear damage
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:20.780]   There's their intent. Is it gonna help reanna?
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:26.220]   Whatever weapons the question is it gonna help somebody who's merely harassed as opposed to sent to the hospital?
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:28.860]   Is that what you're asking?
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:32.460]   Well, I'm trying to understand like yes, I guess
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:36.540]   How do you how do you go how far do you have to go?
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:40.620]   In what other mediums could you pursue someone?
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:46.460]   You know and cause harm to them because you can think about like and this is stacey and her iot stuff
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.620]   but I could ask
[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:55.180]   You know a device to I could put responsibilities on a certain device and I don't know my hoo lights
[02:03:55.180 --> 02:04:00.700]   They actually can go into strobe mode. So if you send my hoo lights into strobe mode, what does that mean?
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:03.900]   I don't know that's criminal and you would go to jail if you got caught
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:07.740]   So I we got to wrap it up. It's almost four
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:11.500]   Niman neiman lab says
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:19.020]   People trust news stories not based on who published it. They don't look at that. They look at who shared it
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:27.740]   So if the person who shared a story is credible the story is deemed credible even if it came from a completely nonsensical site
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:34.540]   People are heavily influenced by the identity of the sharer just a little tip a little tidbit sure
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:39.980]   That's why nuzzles so popular. Yes because it's yeah because it's a yes. I agree. It's kind of
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:42.140]   It's vetted
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:44.140]   That's why I like that crowds thing, right?

[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:57.420]   I do
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:03.980]   I have and sadly the link is not linking. I can't share my if this then I can't if this then that applets anymore
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:09.900]   Yeah, I know let's start it stops. It's staying. It's strong. This is good and it's google specific too
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:12.700]   So this is my really specific if this then that applet
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:17.660]   So my challenge is every night before I got a bet I turned my phone to do not disturb mode because
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:20.380]   I love my sleep. Yes
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:23.420]   And I hate notifications about new albums in the middle. I don't want to hear
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:27.740]   So what I did is I tied it to my fitbit
[02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:34.780]   And what happens so you activate your fitbit and I believe you can do this with other fitness trackers that are also
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:38.140]   And if this and that they don't have a i'm sleeping mode now
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:42.460]   So I have to manually turn it off at night, but in the morning. I always forgot to
[02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:49.260]   Turn it back on so I'd be like at two o'clock. I'd be like you have 30 miss calls because I never turned my phone
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.660]   Ringer back on basically. So
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:56.300]   I set it up. So once my fitbit has logged my sleep for the night
[02:07:56.300 --> 02:08:02.780]   It turns the ringer on my phone up to 70 percent in my case, but you can turn it all the way up if you want
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:09.340]   Um, if you're running android 7.0, it will take your phone up from do not disturb mode
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:12.140]   If you're running anything earlier than that you shouldn't be
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:14.700]   Um also
[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:18.540]   It won't work. So this is for people with android phones and a fitbit
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:24.620]   But you can also do it with other sleep tracking things and it's not immediate. It takes a few minutes, but it is like
[02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:31.420]   Help me all this week. Make sure I answer my or make sure I get my phone calls in text. So yay
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:38.620]   So so okay, so i'm in my fitbit and I say as soon as I record my fitbit sleep
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:41.500]   Turn notification back on
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.700]   Turn yeah turn ringer volume to
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:49.180]   Hi or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, nice. Whatever you want. All right
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:52.540]   So I like it because I I literally never remember to set this up. So
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:54.220]   Nice to know
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:56.860]   I have just done a schedule so that it's automatic
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:09:01.980]   It's 7 a p.m. It turns off and at 8 a.m. It turns on or whatever, you know
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:06.220]   I don't wake up on a set time especially on the weekends. So I'm kind of like
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:09.020]   I'm gonna say so. Yeah. Yeah

[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:05.980]   By singing i've been working on the railroad sometime today
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:09.580]   Thank you
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:13.740]   Stacy higginbotham sat thanks so much for joining us great to great to hear from you
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:16.940]   We actually ordered that lutron casetta
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:21.900]   And megan's gonna do a review in her new house of that. Oh nice. Oh
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:25.820]   Somebody asked me why I told you to do that instead of
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:32.060]   Z wave things. Yeah, it is because lutron is more reliable and because
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:36.780]   The z wave they're just they're just and because you already have smart things
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:41.580]   That's what they were. That's why they wanted to know but lutron has the smart things integration and now it's really good
[02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:44.860]   So that's it and it works with my echo
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:48.540]   Which was like the number one reason I want to do it because I can talk my lights to sleep, right?
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:56.620]   Actually, you should have a way to tell you I bet you we're let's find a way that stacey can wake up and say turn my phone on to her echo
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:12:03.180]   I could do it with my google assistant. I bet my google home. I bet
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:08.540]   Okay, I'll I'll work in it or you could now how do you when you record your sleep? What do you record?
[02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:10.300]   Did you say i'm awake?
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:13.260]   No, it just automatically starts recording whenever it thinks that you moved
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:18.220]   Yeah, I don't I don't care if it's like super accurate. This is this is accurate enough. Okay
