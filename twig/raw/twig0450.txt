[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Mike Elgin joins Stacey Higginbotham and me to talk about the Oracle Google battle
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.060]   It looks like the battle's on again to the tune of eight point eight billion dollars
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.600]   We'll compare and contrast Google's classroom strategy with apples and a big change in the way Google does its search index
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   All coming up next on Twig
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.240]   Netcasts you love from people you trust
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:42.280]   This is Twig bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly C A C H E F L Y
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   .com
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:54.440]   This is Twig this week in Google episode 450 recorded Wednesday March 28 2018
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   I just swallowed a bully walk this week in Google is brought to you by
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.440]   Lighthouse with 3d and AI
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.800]   Lighthouse is the only camera that gets your busy life at home get 15% off a lighthouse camera with promo code twit at light
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.880]   house
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.720]   and by
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.400]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans home plays a big role in your life
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.720]   That's why quick and loans created rocket mortgage
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.160]   It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully so you could be confident
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.280]   You're getting the right mortgage for you get started at rocket mortgage.com/twig
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.180]   It's time for twig this week in Google that lovely laugh could only be one person Mike Elgin
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.320]   From Elgin.com he's come home to roost. Yes. I'm here to roost chickens have come under roost
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.680]   Mike is of course the parapetetic Mike Elgin the digital nomad and I know your gastronomads
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.560]   Dinnars are actually their weeks a week we call things. Yeah. Yep. We got one coming up in Italy one in France
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.480]   The one in France still has an opening so if we'd love to have
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.320]   Everyone join us it's gonna be what is that awesomeness. That's in late June
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.200]   Gastron nomad dot net. Yeah, if you want to and then get going the menu click experiences
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.960]   First sign up for the news other than click experience first sign up for the newsletter then click answer. So Provence the second one there
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.720]   Oh
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   Provence you're doing in Provence. This is gonna be the most killer thing ever we we actually personally
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.320]   I personally though tasted all the wine in Provence
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   and
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.440]   There's a lot of it. I woke up in a ditch, but it was like a there's your beautiful wife
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.000]   My mirror will be cooking for you all and cooking with you all the house. We're staying at has a lavender feel like that
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.440]   I love the lavender feels around the house love
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   So Stacy, what do you think Stacy Higginbotham's also here? She is Stacy on IOT calm the author of the Higginbotham letter
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.760]   Which you really missed a bet by not calling it that I'm just saying
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.000]   Did I did I really miss that I think the Higginbotham letter I would subscribe sight unseen
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   To the Higginbotham letter well, I tell you what I'll make one just for you. Would you please that would be great?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.760]   Great to have you both next week. You'll be happy to know
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.200]   Wendy Nather is gonna be joining us on the show because I think
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.480]   We're gonna miss Jeff Jarvis for a couple of weeks in a row. Oh
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.880]   Be Jeff and Wendy and Stacy
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.280]   Well actually then I may bow out because I'm getting the the Botox done for the migraines
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.800]   Oh, and we should say this is not a cosmetic treatment because you're already perfect
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.840]   But just the way I had not heard this but Lisa was telling me about this you can they but they put it in your shoulders and stuff
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   So that you don't get tense doing it yet giving her headaches and so it's 37 shots
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.800]   Along your shoulders your neck your head and then five on your face
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.860]   So you get them and then you don't care if you have a headache because you're such a
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.880]   Well, they're they're little shots. We're gonna see how it works. Go and see but good luck
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.440]   My appointment is like an hour before twig so it's possible that I just decided everyone
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.760]   Take it easy. No, there's no need. There's no need relax and joy
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.280]   Enjoy the Botox high. It's more important to schedule your dental appointments right before twig
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:32.640]   We like that is this real life. This is the show we talk about real life really sometimes too real
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   I'm sad to say Facebook of course as well as Google as well as the Twitter
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:47.080]   I'm actually bummed about this first term and get out of the way oracle. I remember it was suing Google over Java in the
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.320]   Android devices and
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.960]   They have managed they lost in court
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.800]   Google has now I mean Oracle has now revived it and
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.080]   Google may owe them eight point eight billion dollars
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.440]   The federal court
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.080]   US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that's the that's the patent court out of DC, right?
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.920]   That's the one that really is kind of out of sync. I think with the rest of them ruled on Tuesday
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.480]   That Google's use of Java shortcuts. This was not by the way
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.440]   That they stole Java, right?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.600]   This is the API
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.080]   So shortcuts isn't quite right. It's what's the point of an API? Yeah, but the right but this stupid court
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.960]   They're one ignorant judge away from a really disastrous. That's a good way of putting it
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.640]   We're all one ignorant judge away from disastrous
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.920]   Yeah, well APIs are the bedrock of the modern like tech economy
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.000]   So having to put yeah, this is really distressing the dispute according to Bloomberg technology
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.880]   Which could have far reaching implications for the entire software industry has divided Silicon Valley for years between those who develop the code
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   That makes software
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.000]   Steps function. I don't know. I think that that's typo and those who develop software programs
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.720]   Develop the code that makes software steps fun
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.200]   I think this is a mangled oracle's trying to milk it because I mean as as Steve was saying on on security now this week
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.320]   The number one scenario for developers is their companies forced them to use Java, but they'd really love to use Python
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:39.120]   This is this was from stack overflow. There was a they they actually they actually had that is one of the one of the
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.000]   Things that they deduced from stack overflow usage. I think that that's true, but this isn't even
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.560]   Exactly that they use Java exactly. This is that they they use the Java API
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.320]   But it makes you kind of not trust oracle as much as a developer
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.400]   I mean you get you this Bloomberg story by the way is so messed up
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.320]   I'm sorry. I even pulled it up by using the API's programmers don't have to write new code from scratch
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.960]   No
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.400]   Sky wherever wrote this doesn't understand an AP what an API is that's a library?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.080]   Sorry, Susan. I'm gonna have to explain to Susan Decker what an API is. I'll explain to you all what an API is
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.440]   What's an API?
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.560]   stands for application programming interface and it's what allows you to
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.200]   To for instance, I'll give you a good example
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:29.320]   Twit has an API we decided when we redesigned our website that we would do it in two parts that we would use Drupal
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.720]   Which is a very good content management system, but we'd use something called headless Drupal. You never see the Drupal Drupal sits in the background
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.840]   And we use it for all of our workflow when we create a new show and so forth and you can
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.320]   Get keys to our API and then interact with the database through the API
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:55.720]   It's something we want you to do because then you can write an application our application was our website the website
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.400]   Talks to the database through our twit API and generates a beautiful website
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:08.120]   There's also an app my twit there's several apps now, but my twits one of them that actually pulls from the API
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.080]   And we prefer that because that means when you have an app that's a twit app
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   Even though we didn't develop it you will always have the latest information because you query our database
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.880]   That's a good thing you publish the API it's published we publish it on apiary
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.160]   Which is a site for apis so that people can use it and the only reason we make you get a key is so that
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:35.520]   Everybody doesn't scrape all our data and kill our bandwidth, but it's an API is supposed to be open
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.600]   That's how we communicate so copywriting an API meaning you can't duplicate an API is gonna have a horrific chilling effect on
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.400]   As if Walmart sued Amazon because Jeff Bezos walked through the front door of a Walmart. That's essential
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.360]   Okay, so I think you guys are being maybe a bit naive or maybe a bit
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.600]   Tech focused here, and I'm not I'm not just I totally agree with all of this however I
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.120]   As I said before APIs are becoming the bedrock of
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:14.480]   Kind of the economy especially with IOT because we're having so many devices and services talk to so many other services
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.040]   So what's happening is instead of just a tech
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.040]   kind of layer to this we're getting a political and business goals layer to this and so
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.560]   Oracle's case isn't a technical case. It's a business case and they're saying hey
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   We don't want you to use our APIs to build a competing platform
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:38.000]   There are a lot of people who keep their APIs private just for that reason and and so I
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.800]   Would say that we do need some sort of legal framework about
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:49.080]   APIs, but we also need to understand that they are no longer just a bridge between services and I think
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.120]   Your definition is wonderful. Leo, but I just explained it to normal people like hey
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.520]   It's a bridge that lets my software talk to your software and speak kind of the same language
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.760]   But my question is why can't Oracle use technical means to prevent Google from accessing the API?
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:11.560]   Well, it's not that they were acts. It's that they duplicated the API right right so in if if if Google wants to
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.320]   Use Java Oracle says that's fine
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.920]   But you need to license it because you're making a commercial product and you made 42 billion according to them 42 billion dollars off of Android
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.880]   So Google says oh well then we won't use Oracle Java
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.960]   We'll write our own code, but in order for it to work with Java programs it has to support the Java API
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.600]   so
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.400]   This is kind of like what Microsoft does with the Linux
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.280]   for Windows system or
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:47.360]   Wine does wine does this to Microsoft yeah to allow so they duplicate the API so that a program that's sitting on an Android machine
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:54.840]   Doesn't know that it's not talking to Java. It could be talking to Dalvik, which is some other you know Java compatible
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.280]   And I guess there you could make the case if you're Oracle well
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.440]   They should use Java and they should license Java
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.080]   But this is there's a long-standing tradition of
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.800]   companies
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:13.560]   Duplicating APIs the API by itself contains no knowledge. It's not the program. It's like how to connect
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.720]   It's as it could be like the copyright era
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:24.360]   So this will be like the Carter phone decision for the API era think about it that way because they're trying to govern
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.240]   How someone talks to their software and they're saying we have it and they have a business case for wanting this to be in
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.200]   technologists
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.360]   historically and rightly so or like hey we want this to be as open and
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.840]   Be as generous so we can all have things work together and talk to each other and we don't have to make our lives miserable
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.000]   This isn't this has been going on for six years remember judge al-Sop who taught himself Java
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.560]   He ruled in 2012 that APIs are not copyrightable and I think that's the correct
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.240]   ruling because to do so would basically
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.280]   tie up
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:06.160]   I mean I kind of I do understand Oracle's point of view but but but but we need to have open APIs
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.480]   We just really do and to say you can copyright it is not you can block somebody from using Java
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.600]   But you can't block how you interact with a Java like program. I think that's inappropriate
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.680]   It seems like Oracle's the wrong kind of company to be in control of all that's another issue
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.200]   But that's a lot of this has to do with personalities right Google's got a lot of money
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:32.320]   They may the the circuit court even said Google made 42 billion dollars on Android. They should give some of it to Oracle
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.280]   No
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.680]   Larry Ellison already owns in a Hawaiian Island. He doesn't need yeah Larry's just fine
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.320]   If you want I went I'm gonna pitch my stuff
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.840]   I wrote a story on this actually two weeks ago not on the lawsuit
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.040]   but on the role of APIs and how they're expanding from pure tech to a
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:58.080]   business tool so if you're excited about APIs well maybe that's maybe that's it so
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.960]   This is a weird case by the way because it it changed
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:10.800]   over time because of various rulings in Oracle trying to find ways to keep it alive so after alsop
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   Turn it down in 2012
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.400]   It went back federal district federal circuit in 2014 reversed alsop
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.720]   alsop found the Java APIs are copyrightable but gave google an out saying this is eff
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.600]   a little more accurate uh giving uh
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.000]   The possibility that google could have a fair use defense right you have a fair use of a copyrighted thing
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.160]   Now that's frankly what all of the subsequent court decisions have been on not whether you could copyright an API that actually was considered settled
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.360]   What isn't settled is is there a fair use defense against reusing the API
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Google asked the supreme court to review it the supreme court said no
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:00.000]   uh the case went to district court for the fair use defense and in 2016 a jury
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.560]   unanimously agreed that google's use of Java was fair use of the APIs was fair use
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:13.600]   Oracle appealed again and they appealed this time with that washing and dc federal circuit court
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.120]   Which has historically been problematic for tech companies. They've really upheld strong
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.360]   intellectual property rights
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   And this is what just happened as they said no no you have no fair use defense because you made 42 billion dollars
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.240]   Uh on the API and you know on that very narrow interpretation
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:39.040]   I think that that's probably the case. How can you say it's fair use if you use it commercially and you made 42 billion
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.800]   That much money on the API they I mean how much money did they make on the API itself?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.880]   That's how you calculated on the other hand would and red have been successful as successful
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.680]   If you couldn't use java to develop for it and use the java you could actually have your own API
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.520]   That wouldn't have been a hard thing to do google and hindsight probably should have done that
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.560]   Oh, I'm sure they wish they did now. Yeah
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.200]   8.8 billion dollars
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.360]   Is a significant portion of their own other eye on this? That's another island
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.000]   Congratulations Larry all that money they spent developing waves they could have been doing uh
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.600]   Rebuilding java APIs. I I don't think uh there is any more to this case
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.760]   I think it's that's that but I but we'd need a lawyer to tell us because
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   One would have thought it was that was that after the supreme court said no, we're not gonna review it
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   But that it's
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.680]   Oracle kept it alive somehow google should pay in bitcoin
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.160]   Just a thought uh so yeah, if you take the personalities out
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:44.880]   It's an interesting case actually, you know what friday this we can law tune in i'm sure deneese howl and company will
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.640]   Discuss it because it it isn't really about apis even though we i feel like apis
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:59.040]   Should not be copper abridle rightable that is already decided it's whether google had a fair use defense on their use of it weird
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.960]   weird so
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.240]   Yesterday we got up early to watch apple's classroom event
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:13.840]   Uh everyone's in oil apple does one of these in my opinion you you guys can say i'm wrong clonkers
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.720]   where they had an opportunity to
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.320]   Really do something important instead they released
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.240]   An updated ipad for the same price that has a pencil support
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.080]   They made a lot of hay saying how great education is great pr and educators love that
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.520]   Yeah, but fundamentally i don't think they changed the landscape at all
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:40.080]   It's problematic one of the problematic things they did was that they they said okay if you're in the education space
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.920]   Uh, you get all this iCloud storage
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:51.520]   And i think this is problematic because the rest of us are like wait a minute. What about me i i know i personally me and my family
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.600]   spend
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.400]   $30,000 a year on apple stuff and they give us and then and then they spam us
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.880]   i mean i got i'm talking about my son his wife there you know
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:08.240]   Uh and then i spend and then i'm spanned mercilessly to pay for more iCloud storage and i
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.840]   It makes me want to quit apple. Yeah, i'm so sick of being
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.600]   Spam as an every time i use an apple gives classrooms unlimited storage apple gives them 200 gigabytes
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.000]   That's new they are going to give them 200 gigabytes per student
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.880]   But it's like it seems like that that's kind of like okay you see see how easy that was to give people
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.160]   200 gigabytes of iCloud storage do it for all of us
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.880]   Um regarding the the problem with the thing that bugs me about all of this of course google came out with their with their chrome tablet
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.920]   That the aser tablet i guess it's a before the day before $329 strange price exactly the same as the ipad price clearly
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.520]   Uh, you know sort of like going after the same thing tablet is not ideal for a regular chrome book is fantastic for education
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   I think they did it just because they could yeah
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.840]   Stacey does your daughter use uh chrome books or uh ipads i forgot so they use actually mac books
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   At her school, but they are on google's education platform ironically even if you use ipad you can use classroom google's classroom
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.240]   That's there's a really good. There's a really good comparison to apple and google
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.480]   Apple has a new homework or whatever it's called toolkit, but you have to use apple devices to use it
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.800]   Google and why would you do that?
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.840]   Yeah, because you apple that's apple but think about how
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.400]   Disadvantaged that is for anybody who doesn't have the $30,000 a year to spread an apple price
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   You can't give that to a kid and be like, oh, i'm sorry. Can you not afford?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.120]   You know an iphone you're on a crappy android phone well
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.200]   Sucks to be you a quick funny story my son
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.720]   To point it out when he was in i think it was middle school. He said that they have a a brand new
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.400]   mac and mac for every student in the school
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.120]   I'm like, how did like he's like yeah, my friend's gary my friend gary his dad bought him all
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.080]   What's what's your gary's last name wasniak?
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.320]   There's a lot of god house
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.040]   Okay, so if you don't happen to go to school where the wasniak's lives exactly
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.760]   uh, you know
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.240]   I was well i'll give you an example lisa was saying this
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.360]   Yesterday morning before we went to the bench. She said i'd like to see my wife
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.760]   I'd like to see apple put aside some of their vast trove of cash
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.560]   few hundred million half a billion
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.240]   To subsidize schools if you're gonna if you're gonna have this expensive stuff and you really believe in education
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.160]   Maybe some subsidies wouldn't hurt. We'll buy them for the teachers
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.880]   What if they would have apple bought every single teacher
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:43.120]   And i don't think just pay their taxes like a real company and then i just talking to districts
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.880]   Could do what they would want with it instead of having to buy apple products. I know it's crazy
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.040]   It's crazy, but but I by the way real companies don't pay taxes
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.320]   I believe real companies should pay taxes
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.120]   Yeah, you do but
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.640]   I agree agree
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.600]   But i but i still think that you know i just think that crumbles crumbooks are just the greatest
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.360]   The whole the whole system i think if you're completely objective and you think about what would be best for classroom
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.920]   A two hundred dollar Chromebook that the it department loves because they can maintain it
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.560]   It's robust has a full keyboard
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.120]   You can get more expensive crumbooks that have pens that do much of what the ipad does
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.920]   You've got the android store. You've got chrome OS
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.720]   You've got lots of curriculum
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.200]   uh, I feel like
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   on an objective basis
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:38.640]   A Chromebook just and the kids can go home and log in with any device and get exactly what they were working on when they were
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.160]   If money were unlimited, I would say buy a MacBook that'd be better. I don't think that would be better
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.360]   Here's here's here's the thing that nobody talks about except teachers
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.120]   Uh, because I've interviewed a lot of teachers about about education devices
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:57.280]   What nobody talks about is if you have little kids walking around with apple devices in their backpacks, they get mugged
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:04.000]   Those things have resale value if somebody if somebody finds out that all the kids at the school have an ipad in their backpack
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   With a pencil. Okay, those kids are going to get mugged
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   And that those devices are going to get stolen
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.920]   Right if if they're left at school then they go home and they only have android and windows
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.240]   It's they can't do that the stuff that they were working on
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.160]   The best solution is to have chrome books and if you if the kids if you leave them at the school
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.200]   It's fine because then they can log in at home if they take them home
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.440]   That's fine too because nobody mugs a kid for a Chromebook
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.240]   Not a $300 Chromebook
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.720]   Let me tell my point only I didn't think it was muggers
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.800]   I was just thinking about how destructive kids are to things because that too
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.440]   And by the way, apple with all of its ads shows these kids with bare naked ipads
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.240]   Dropping watermelons and mattresses and yeah
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.880]   And then the real truth comes out that logitech is offering four schools only an $80 case keyboard case
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.720]   That is built out of like a brick of solid rubber
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:01.120]   And they know that that's a problem. They know that that's a huge problem, but I okay now tell me if this is
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.280]   Maybe a political pie in the sky
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.760]   But I feel like education especially public education
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:17.200]   Should embrace open technologies not proprietary technologies should not vote with its dollar for
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.360]   Companies should vote with his dollar towards open
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.480]   Well, that seems like what public I private schools go ahead and buy whatever you want
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.000]   But public schools should be open they still yeah, not too open. I mean you don't want kids
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   Linux for gosh. Oh my god
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.120]   Actually a little open get ready for this in the age of betsy divorce
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.200]   I'm kind of surprised to see this the united states department of education
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.560]   Has a page obviously betsy hasn't found it yet
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.160]   Hashtag go open where they're saying why use openly licensed educational resources
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:58.560]   Oh to increase equity to keep content relevant and high quality to empower teachers to save money. Oh, oh
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.120]   all of those things
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.640]   This is very contrary to the current administration which wants, you know private school vouchers and really doesn't really support public education
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.560]   I think directly but
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:18.000]   At least as little as they can but I do think that that that truthfully educators want open now admittedly open hasn't always been the best solution
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.080]   I was gonna say open can be a bear to use and you don't really want to think of moodle
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.880]   Yeah, you don't want to encumber not kids could probably get there, but teachers that their life is really hard
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.080]   I mean
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   God learning new software is just no fun. I know I agree no I 100 100 percent support that and I because I see silicon valley all the time
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.160]   Come into schools and give them technology say hey enjoy. Thanks. We got the tax break
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.320]   You got the you know the stuff. We'll see you later
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.040]   Yeah
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.440]   And it and it never gets used because no one knows how to use and that's actually been a big problem with ipads
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.360]   I look at the LA
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:00.240]   Department of school department that's suing apple and Pearson because their ipad experiment there tens of millions of dollars
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   I've had experiment was a flop
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.800]   Many jurisdictions made the state of main
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.360]   Not happy at all
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   But I agree also open but see this is maybe google's a good solution because I think google's solution is basically open
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:21.920]   Well, it doesn't so as technologists we have a very clear idea of what open software is open source software is we know what that is
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.560]   But but there's but conceptually having everything beyond the public internet is another kind of open
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.160]   It's not so true if a school uses a problem because you can use any hardware with it
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.400]   Exactly and so on a crumbo that sense you can you know, it's if it's in a browser. Okay. This is this is the whole internet
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:47.360]   This is available to everyone. It's like you and the schools can then go ahead and pick and choose educational resources that are that are served through a browser
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.840]   and those can be
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.080]   Not non-probriatory you just described my children's it department
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   Or the school that's what they do you access all the google services all the software they use is through the browser and
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.880]   They've got their synons for various different things. That's actually that becomes the most cumbersome part is
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.600]   You know figuring out what they're what their password is for various
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:20.880]   Yeah, well, and this is apples. This is why apple is appealing. I mean it's appealing to us as end users is appealing to educators too because
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.280]   It is it's closed nature means it's easier
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.640]   So one of the things apple is going to offer is an it they have you know, this new classwork
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.280]   framework and they have this it
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:40.560]   Support and the it administrator for instance can issue apple ids to everybody in the school instantly and oh my god
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.160]   They're not real apple ids apple keeps doesn't have any view into that what's going on with that ids
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.440]   So there was good privacy. They can be later converted to apple ids. Mm. That's interesting
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.520]   I wonder why anyone would want to do that but that but so apple make it is easier. It's it's pretty it's clean
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.160]   It's easy and so you can see the same reason consumer you're using an iPad the same reason
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:09.920]   So google docs and stuff are not hard. No effect many schools are using it, aren't they the only reason I use a
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.480]   Macbook for example is my main
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.440]   Device is there's there's like two applications that I need to use
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.960]   One is a sound editing app and the other one's like I don't know something else
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   But it's like I would be on a Chromebook in a second and because it's easier
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.920]   It's it's not only easier in terms of how hard it is to figure out you have to remember that when you use a
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:38.560]   Tablet that's you know like an iPad you every app has a different way to use it and different security things
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.520]   It has to be and then you need like a pretty robust tech support department in the in the school
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.320]   School district or the school to sort of manage that whereas if people are using everything through a browser
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.120]   You pretty much don't even need it to it it support you don't need to issue IDs
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.200]   You don't need to do any of that stuff
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:03.520]   The teachers can personally manage what the station doesn't do your daughter have a google ID that the school gave her
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.920]   I know she has a son does
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.240]   Yeah, she has a google ID that the school gave her and she also has her own email address
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.280]   But
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:18.240]   She and her classmates and I can't actually email her right on her school ID which drives everyone nuts because well, but that's how they keep it
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.240]   But that's safe. I get it. I get it
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.080]   So but she and her friends chat on it and it's all lovely
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.760]   I yeah, I I mean I I understand and school administrator is going to be
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:37.040]   Swayed by apples promise of privacy and they're gonna say well. Hey after Facebook. We don't call is just as private
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:44.560]   They do not take no it's not thinking they have a document that describes all of this. Yeah, okay. I was like well, you're
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.880]   cuz so
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.200]   Megan Maroney was telling me that she had said something disparaging about google privacy or there remember there was a kind of a
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.000]   Fear about google and I think google responded to that a year or so ago
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.920]   But she had somebody from google education called her and said no, let me tell you it's completely
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.680]   We are we make sure the kids privacy. We don't want the kids information
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.320]   We make sure it's safe and I believe that I trust that if face by the way facebook if they offered an education initiative
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   I think I might stay away. Yeah
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.400]   But no messenger for kids for you. You know what facebook by the way was gonna do I didn't know this a voice assistant
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.120]   Right and they canceled it or at least
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.680]   They delayed it
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.200]   And
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.320]   So they deferred it and then the information talked about how they're gonna do the on device process or the processing
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.160]   On the device as opposed to in the sir in the cloud so in their servers
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.520]   So I thought that was kind of an interesting twist
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.240]   And we have a lot more horsepower than the echo and google home and all of that
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:51.440]   Um, it depends on how I mean, I think the google home it or sorry not the good that the echo has a decent arm
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.760]   Is it a yeah, but it doesn't do anything locally does it it doesn't it could though
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.200]   Like the hardware the hardware is built into a lot of these things
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.040]   I mean, I think the thing they're talking about is that the voice processing is done locally and that's yes and that's
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:13.200]   You know, well, nobody's gonna trust facebook. I mean regardless of what the facts are in the device
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.360]   They have worked hard to earn our distrust. Yes over the years
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.920]   And so it's done their best it's it's hard enough to get an amazon device into our homes
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.440]   Um google and apple devices is goes down easier. I think
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:32.160]   Uh, but man face a little piece of hardware. I don't think I saw um mark zuckerberg on the bbc
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.480]   Uh a few years ago make it. Let me play this uh this clip
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:43.840]   From uh mark zuckerberg and the bbc so who is going to own the facebook content the person who puts it there or you
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.560]   Oh this media could not be played. I'm having my usual problem with twitter video. Here we go
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.000]   Let's do that again. Look content the person who puts it there or you
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.760]   The person who's putting the content on facebook always owns the information
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.520]   And that's why this is such an important thing and and why facebook is such a special service that people feel a lot of ownership over
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.240]   Right. This is their information. They own it and you won't say that. They often want to know of course not
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.400]   I mean they they want to share it with um with only a few people just to be clear
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.880]   You're not going to sell or share any of the information on facebook
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.720]   What they say we can do is just we're not going to share people's information
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.920]   Except for the people that they've asked for it to be shared
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.640]   By the way, that was from 2009
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:33.040]   As you can see young young sweaty mark still sweaty, but very young. Yeah, was he lying there
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.080]   Or did they change their here's the lie
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.280]   I'm sorry. Here's the lie. The lie is
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:46.640]   The the the idea that users are aware of what they are giving permission for so facebook is
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:55.680]   Text technically saying the truth because sure because they have to give permission the whole business model of many companies especially companies like facebook is
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:02.640]   User ignorance. That's the business model. They take advantage of users who don't know what's happening because if they did not know
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.600]   And they were given a clear permission. They would not approve it
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.120]   So stacy is it mark that's naive or the users that are naive?
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.880]   No, that that is a very good point
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   I also think mark has consistently because he was so young
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.520]   He was very naive with this idea that
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.920]   We remember when he was like who will want privacy. No one will want privacy anymore. Where everything's better when we're connected
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.160]   so
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.680]   You know when he was in college, he said you know users are idiots because they trust me right?
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.240]   Well in that's right. Yeah, that was
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.760]   Or was that the social network? No, that that was real
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:43.680]   I can no longer distinguish mark Zuckerberg saying creepy awful things or the social network saying them. Yeah, it's terrible
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.480]   Yeah, but there's a there's a larger issue. I mean the the whole yula thing of almost every product
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.640]   They know that nobody's gonna read that stuff. They know that nobody knows what's in it
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   And they they you know people would be outraged if they understood that that you're when you agree to all the stuff
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.360]   You agree to when you buy a smartphone you're agreeing to the notion that you don't own that smartphone
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.840]   right well, and some of this has changed over time which is worth noting because
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:17.280]   I look at the privacy erosion in like some of my connected devices and I'm like oh you punks
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.680]   You just took this away from me and I've got this thing installed in my house and it's frustrating
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.200]   So I think that's also what happened with facebook because they remember there are two steps forward and
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:34.240]   eroding privacy and then the apology step backwards and then you know two steps forward again and so this is
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.760]   You know at the time maybe he was telling the truth. I don't remember
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:44.320]   I've been through so many Zuckerberg privacy scandals. I no longer remember silicon valley companies often have a cult-like
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:50.720]   Culture and facebook is especially bad in that sense when as a journalist when you go to facebook and you confront them with
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.000]   with you know pointed questions about what they're doing
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:01.600]   They have this glaze look in their eyes like we're just making the world a better place because we're connecting everybody and that just makes
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.120]   Everything wonderful. I don't know why you would think that there's an affair. No, no
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.360]   Facebook exists to make billions and billions of dollars out of giving
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.440]   Advertisers stuff that users don't want to give up necessarily and that's the business
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:23.360]   And it's just like the business of congress is for the most part in the conflict between the public and the you know the the powers that be including
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.560]   Massive corporations. They're in the business of of giving the corporations taking stuff away from people and giving the corporations
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.320]   All the while making people think that they're getting what you know, they're being served
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:41.040]   That's the whole business and so if you if you have a super cynical view like that you can understand facebook a lot better
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.920]   They're not trying to make the world a better place. They're trying to be
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.280]   the world's most rich and powerful company and they're on their way. I uh if you if you
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.320]   are still of
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.080]   two minds, I don't know whether mark is uh
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.880]   just innocent
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.840]   or
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.680]   From day one planned this
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:10.000]   A few years ago after the winkle vos lawsuit during the winkle vos lawsuit a hard draw marks hard drive from harvard was recovered
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And the judge decided you did not want to see it
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.960]   But then uh business insider
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:20.320]   This is in 2010 very very you know, only a year after that interview in the bbc
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.800]   Uh had sources who say they had the contents of that hard drive and they published the new yorker later confirmed it
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.040]   They say and published it themselves
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.120]   With a few interesting instant messaging conversations. That's where they they trust me
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.640]   That's where he said they tried that's what i did is i was trying to find the source of this
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.680]   Uh, and by the way, one of the things he
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.640]   Mids to in this exchange is that yeah, he did screw the winkle vos twins
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.720]   He says unless i f the dating site people over and quit on them right before I told them i'd have done it
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   He says i don't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.800]   I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too, but the guy doing the dating thing the winkle vos is is going to promote it pretty
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.320]   Well, I wonder what the ideal solution is and he goes on and on
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.680]   Uh, this is this is kind of a smoking gun
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.640]   um, but he also
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.960]   is very clear that this guy is
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   Pretty cynical
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   Yeah, pretty pretty
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.440]   And what cynical people do when when necessary in order to make a lot of money and and have an ipo
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:32.240]   And do all the things that CEOs of big tech companies do is they have to they have to represent themselves as having a kind of
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.680]   Disneyland view of the world where everything's great. It's utopian
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.720]   We're we're trying our best. We're doing this that the other thing
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.240]   I actually don't think that mark zuckerberg is immoral or unethical. I think he's amoral and
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.280]   A ethical that's a word. Well, I also I want to say he's not alone
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   We talked about surveillance capitalism and shishana zubov last week
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.320]   Um, it's pretty clear that facebook is a poster boy for this
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:04.240]   But that a lot of companies are engaged but you recognize a pattern with facebook where they they
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.360]   Again and again again. I'm not talking about dozens of times but hundreds of times over the years
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.080]   They push the envelope beyond where it should go
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.800]   If they if there's no big public outcry they keep going if there is
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.160]   They have this whole process where they say, you know, they sort of
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:26.480]   Apologize and they sort of go through the motions to do a fix whatever will it's they
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:32.640]   I've heard somebody and I apologize to whoever said this because it was some brilliant tech journalist. I think who said this
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.960]   Might have been stacy franow
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:42.240]   Basically said um, they treat ethical issues like a programming problem. Right. Right. So they so does silicon valley
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.640]   Yeah
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.280]   Less so than faith. I think facebook is really the poster child
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.360]   There's something about facebook's culture where they really really try all these things
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.560]   And you know and and if you look at their research, there doesn't seem to be anybody saying wait a minute
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.400]   We probably shouldn't do that that would be unethical right just have it right glue about
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.040]   What is the right thing to do and wrong thing to do that? That's just a
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:08.240]   You know a bizarre question that adults a lack of adult supervision stacy should share
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.680]   Cheryl sander or somebody like that be saying boys
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.640]   not kind of off so much sexism in that whole construction there
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.480]   um
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:26.400]   A girls could be a moral be Cheryl may still have the same a moral issues. Um, so I was giving her credit
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:33.120]   I know but that you're because that's why you call it a bro culture right? It's a bro culture. It's uh, it's a bunch of guys
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.320]   Yeah, but I admit very
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.280]   A bunch of gal could be a gal culture like there could be there could be ladies who are also unethical
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.640]   Thank you for defending women. I'm sorry. I besmirched them
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.680]   We could be jerks too, um and make money lots of money
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.240]   um
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:58.080]   I do think that I mean you see it in their culture and you see it in there the people they hire tend to be very
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.560]   technologically astute and so
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.120]   They're just not thinking about these things
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.760]   and
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   That's that's what happens when you don't have normal people to say uh, hey guys or if we do this
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.560]   What about that and they'll be like what?
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.160]   And you see it just in the like
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.480]   In this idea. Yeah, look at that chat with the uh with the
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.200]   Eracist filters and things like that. It's just
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.360]   You really wonder is there is there?
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.080]   I honestly see feel like it's like there's no adult supervision not female, but adults
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.200]   It's not just adult super. I mean like adults have these same
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   It is a lack of diversity and people hammer this home
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.000]   And it's not what I was trying to say in my imperfect fashion
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.760]   Not yeah, but not color not necessarily gender, but just in terms of life experience with real experience. Yeah
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.960]   Well, I I think I think the lack of diversity is in ageism
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.640]   I mean if you have some people who have been around for a few decades. Oh, there's a there's a ton of lack of diversity in silicon valley
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.960]   No, I know there is and I tend to disagree with the reason for more diversity
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.840]   If I can just have this quick aside because I hear it talked a lot about it on on a lot of shows
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:11.440]   Um, and people always often say the reason we more need more diversity is that the customers are diverse
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.520]   And so in order to understand minorities and women and stuff we need minorities and women making decisions so that they don't know
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:24.960]   That's not the reason that's not the reason the reason is is that there are geniuses and brilliant people in all these groups in fact
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.480]   If you look at a super non diverse exclusionary society like Saudi Arabia
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.560]   They're not very successful at things. The reason is that they exclude almost everybody in the country. They're good at oil
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.000]   They're good. They're good. They're good at finding the oil that is under their fees
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.120]   But but but but and the reason likes a country like the united states is is more successful is because we're more diverse
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:50.400]   And if we were much more diverse, we would be much more successful because you don't know where the next
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.920]   Grace hopper is you don't know where the next would you rather have a stew made with just potatoes
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.880]   Or a stew with some beef some carrots some potatoes a little bit of margarum some celery
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.840]   I could go on, but I probably should stop panda meat
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:12.640]   But no, it makes sense. I agree that the the more diverse the recipe the better the flavor
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.760]   But but but I do realize I think that there is a toxic element about amorality in silicon valley
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.920]   But I do think that there's something about the person of mark zuckerberg who just sees it as an abstract and largely
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.120]   Business-related and he hired a lot of people around him that matched his world drove the culture. Yeah, so
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.800]   But that's just a guess on my part. I I have no first-hand
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:38.880]   Knowledge of that. I just you know you I think that there's a place for something that you haven't said that the business is a moral
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.120]   I don't think that's true normally when jeff's here
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.960]   Stacy and I pile on him, but he can defend himself, but now it no jeff were just all all just going after
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.280]   I can just hear we should talk about him behind his back. Just say techno panic
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.880]   Did you did I tell you I just learned this I didn't tell the folks at home
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.320]   Mike has registered for in on jeff's behalf
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.760]   a
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   com special domain
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.040]   I know he's gonna write that book one of these days and so
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:14.880]   Go first. I'm just hoping to get a free copy. We miss we miss you jeff and uh, I know I'll take it on myself to defend
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.440]   Whatever it is jeff defense
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.520]   Google
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.840]   Who knows what to do with the fence now? I don't yeah
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.920]   I have a hard time defending facebook. I have to say uh, you know, steve gipson insulted me mightily yesterday
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.440]   He said finally leo you're finally coming around to the privacy point of view
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.920]   You know, I've been saying this for years and you've been always mr. Open share everything
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:42.400]   I'm still kind of that way, but if somebody is maliciously seemingly maliciously taking advantage of you
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.680]   Uh, you probably don't want to be in that environment
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.080]   I get the feeling as a as a long-time listener that you're you're not you're not
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.640]   As he described you you're a conversation maker. So you play devil's app
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.960]   Well, that's also a lot of other things and and stuff like that, but I do share pretty broadly
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.080]   Maybe way too broadly. Yeah
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.680]   But that's also a hazard
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:13.920]   That comes of being on the air for you know constantly. Yeah, it's a hazard, but it's also a privilege too to say
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:20.320]   Like I don't share my life nearly as wildly because I am a woman and a woman
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.560]   And I'm on and I'm like, yeah, you know what?
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   Lots of and also because frankly, I'm very dull very dull. We have I mean, there's there's reasons we have an armed guard at the front door there
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:37.280]   As admittedly, I don't run the same hazards you do, but it isn't completely hazard free
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.640]   uh, well, yes, there are there are so
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.600]   But I have to say I feel and maybe this is a pathology
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   but I do feel better when I
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.320]   I'm more honest about myself one of the things I learned really early on in broadcasting is
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.600]   authenticity wins and honesty wins
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.560]   And so I've always kind of tried to do
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:04.400]   You don't don't conflate being honest with being private or being or being private with being dishonest
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.600]   I think I think the way I open yeah open. I think that I think well the authenticity thing
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   I think the first public figure who was honest and open in a way that was like clearly
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.200]   uh
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.960]   demonstrable was Howard Stern. Yeah, and that was huge for him huge for him and that that was the whole
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.240]   Point of his show where he said things that people think but didn't say and nobody else on radio was saying
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.320]   I think people misunderstood him and thought he was a shock jock. By the way, Jeff Jarvis loves Howard Stern, right?
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.680]   Yeah, thought he was a shock jock
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.520]   It wasn't it was shocking, but that was but the appeal of it was that it was honest
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.720]   Right and this why I think the podcasting is a far superior medium
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.360]   I think that as we with every new medium that comes out
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:50.880]   The the currency is authenticity. This is why I don't like these inauthentic and PR style podcasts as much as I like the real podcast
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.520]   And you know what I are alone by the way in this yeah
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.920]   I mean one of the biggest one of the most
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:01.120]   One of the biggest uh podcasts out there is joe rogan now. I can't it's authentic
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:08.240]   That's super authentic. That's raw one of the things I don't like about joe rogan is that they are almost always have no idea what they're talking about
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.600]   Uh, but they're hilarious. It's entertaining and and they're very authentic
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.680]   They they they they they blurt stuff. Oh my god. It's like Donald trump
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.320]   He's entertaining and he doesn't know what he's talking about one. There's a thread here
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.920]   Yeah, I don't know if you want to pull it the sweater might evaporate
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.360]   But I think that that's exactly right and I do think that's a good
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.480]   You know if you ask people who support trump that is I just read an interview with rosanne bark because uh
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:39.520]   Her show is back. Yeah, I heard that rosanne's back. I want to watch it. I like rosanne bar
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:46.000]   But she's a trump supporter and and the new york times was very affronted that she was a trump supporter and kept hammering her on it
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.520]   And but but every time I talk to trump supporters and I know quite a few
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.080]   And we have a lot of family members. That's what they come back to he's honest. I you know what you're getting
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.800]   Yeah, he's maybe he's got flaws. He's a flawed human
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.520]   But but he's authentic in a way that politicians have never been but he
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.400]   He points out the difference between authenticity and truthfulness. He's very dishonest
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.400]   But he's very authentic like he's authentically dishonest. Hmm. That's an interesting one
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:18.320]   It's like magically delicious, but it's the political version of that very refreshing. Yeah, um
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.520]   He is kind of like your broken though isn't he?
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.080]   That's interesting, uh
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:33.600]   And he's a trial balloon pilot he throws he says stuff as fact just to see what happens or see you know when you you know when you're um
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.000]   I I have some sympathy because when you're
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.840]   Constantly have to on the air and have to talk and say things you have to eventually
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.560]   You hit the end of things you kind of reasonably thought about and have a reason
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.880]   Opinion about pretty soon. You have to say stuff off the top of your head. You've noticed that stacy
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.880]   I have I you know what I do it. I do it when I write things sometimes
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.520]   I'm like, hey, I've been thinking about this, but then I research a bunch of stuff and then I'm like tell me more guys
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.160]   That's the discipline of writing that uh
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.960]   That's true. It's very different like I I noticed that when I don't write about the things that I'm talking about
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.720]   It's much worse. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's true for me too
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.360]   Uh, which is why I hate writing so much
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.040]   Oh
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.800]   It's so hard. It's hard work. It's so much easier just to blather
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.000]   But then you know what you're actually talking about. Oh, I don't know
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.880]   I find writing much easier than podcast podcasting is really hard. It just
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.120]   I am a good blatherer
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:35.120]   You've got the gift of gab. There you go. I did I tell you I've kicked I've kissed the blarney stone. I have
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.200]   I have
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.080]   Uh, google to expect this is interesting again
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:46.880]   This is a little bit before apples of announcement. They announced that they were going to expand google's classroom software
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.640]   To everybody i've talked to so far is widely agreed to be very good
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.280]   To outside the classroom. They're going to make it available as part of the g suite
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.160]   Now I haven't used classroom stacey have you used it in conjunction with your daughter?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:05.040]   Um, what is classroom exactly? Maybe you have I never know if I like
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.280]   Yeah, um
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.840]   Megan's daughter sons use it. Uh, oh no. We use a different we use this crazy blackboard
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.800]   There's moodle, which is the original open source
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.840]   Join our class. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's an analog to classroom
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.880]   Okay, so it's a cloud based software that lets teachers create classes make assignments
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.680]   Communicate with students collaborate with students
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:38.560]   It's on the google cloud. It uses g you know the g-docs the document suite and gmail and calendar. It's obviously, uh, you know
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:45.600]   Oh, no, she does have that. Yes. Okay. Sorry. Yes. I'm now recalling the I'm not that involved as a parent. So, um,
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.680]   I would be very interested in using this. Uh, this this would be their
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.480]   alternative to
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.600]   Uh, solutions from facebook facebook work, right? Yeah, I wonder if anybody's using facebook work
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.840]   You could use it to give your staff homework assignments
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.200]   And that'd be great
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:11.920]   I give kevin homework all the time like, uh, work day, which is my uh, my my employer. I have a job too, you know, uh, premier uses work day
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.000]   Uh, which I and I really don't like it at all. Yeah
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.840]   Uh, amazon web services. I mean, there's other solutions. So that'd be interesting to see google
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.160]   Expanding that I don't know. We use g sweet. We might look at it
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:32.960]   I just worry that they they see that as a a bucket that they just throw everything into that's google right there in that shell
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:39.360]   There's a specialized on that stuff pixel is in our chat room and he works for a uh,
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.840]   uh, company that does a uh, solution called canvas
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.600]   Lms I guess is the category learning
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.400]   management
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:57.680]   Uh, and he says that there's an open standard which canvas adheres to which is interesting. Hmm. So, um
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.200]   I'm glad you're in the in the chat room today. We should uh
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.880]   We should get you on to talk about this. Are you a developer?
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.400]   For canvas or uh, what do you do for exl?
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.720]   Exl
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   And is this and is this your picture?
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.880]   So are you a real person? Yes. He's the he's the one with blue eyes
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   Oh, they all have they all have
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   A little creepy
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   And they're all blonde. Hmm except for the bald guy. That looks like what he harrelson the ball the bald guy
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:33.280]   Oh, it doesn't like what he does. What he harrelson works for canvas. Yeah, he's the community specialist
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.520]   Which means exl you would be a good authority for us because you deal with educator or he's
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.960]   Uh, he says this is the number two. What's number one blackboard?
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.680]   I'm i'm aware of blackboard
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.840]   Uh, i've seen a lot of these actually
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.920]   Um, anyway enough education
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:57.440]   That's because schools have a lot of money to spend even though you don't think about it and in aggregate sure. Yeah. Well, that's what i'm
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.200]   Yeah
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.000]   Yeah, individually not so much 15 dollars a student a day. Yeah, it starts dad up after a while. Yeah
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.440]   Google is now
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:15.280]   Taking steps against a vast number of android devices that don't use google services
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   This is from xda developers
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:24.800]   Unlicensed devices you you can get a you're not even allowed to call an android if the amazon's uh stuff is android
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.160]   But you can't call it android
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:33.920]   But many apparently in especially the developing world many phones come with android not called android on and then you
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:40.080]   Download a side load of google services which puts the play store on there and then suddenly you have something you really want
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.640]   Uh, google's now starting to say
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:51.600]   Device not certified by google and we're not gonna users who purchased the device device manager has pre-loaded google apps and services
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:57.040]   Without certification for google contact the manufacturer and ask for a certified device
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:03.360]   And if you're an unlicensed manufacturer, you need a license to distribute google apps and services
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:10.640]   So i understand that there are approximately 1000 companies that make smartphones and almost all of them are in china
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.400]   And so this is this is a this is an issue for china almost exclusively and google doesn't do business in china, right?
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   Uh, didn't they pull out? I think they pulled back in uh slightly
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:25.840]   It's it's a it's a mixed bag. I think I i'm not really sure what they're starting
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:31.760]   That's a good question. I should look into that well what's happening with google ronamadio at ours technica says we once imported a shao me
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.920]   Read me three smart from china to review
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:42.480]   I'm booting up. We are surprised to find him it came with the google apps pre-installed because google does not install google apps on chinese devices
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.880]   After we posted the review shao me contacted us with some very scary news
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.080]   The redmi 3 should not come with google play pre-installed because it is a china only product
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.960]   It's very likely the play store you saw was pre-installed by the importer or seller
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.400]   Wow, this is a common practice with unauthorized importers. So
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.960]   Another thing to be aware of and this could actually impact you if you got one of these phones
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.240]   You thought you were using android and suddenly you got that announcement you couldn't use
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:14.960]   the preloaded stuff and I think this is the the constituency here is the authorized
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.000]   Phone makers right because they they pay money
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.680]   They're sick and tired of having to compete with well and there's also a security component to this right. Oh, yeah
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   So that's it's not like this is just pay me more money
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   This is also like if your users think you're getting real android and you're not
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:37.280]   Then what are they getting what they get there where to come from and what is it?
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.320]   So yeah, yeah
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.160]   I just wanted to give the motivation here behind all this because you know
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.120]   It's the why
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.680]   In the five w's let's take a little break
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.080]   Jeff Jarvis not with us, but we are doing our best to defend
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.480]   Us against techno panic. We are not doing our best
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:03.120]   I'm like
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.640]   The techno cynic over here and then I'm like, oh, maybe it's not so bad
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.000]   That's Stacy
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.160]   At iot.com don't forget to subscribe to the newsletter to at gigastacey on twitter
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:22.320]   Mike elgan is el my kelgan on uh on the twitter elgan.com and don't forget gastronomad.net and there's still room for two
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.560]   It's a couple of provents in provons a couple. Yes a couple. God. I wish I could
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.680]   We'll send you a bottle of wine
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:35.600]   Or a barrel. Well, we like uh, we like kind of the more northern like uh cordon's
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:40.400]   The bordos and the burgundy. Yeah, I haven't I can't remember what I was drinking in provons
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.120]   This is this is a long well, you know, it's the funny thing is this is why we cherry pick because there are
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:50.720]   So they're the radically traditional ones and then the the the the sort of like the
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:57.520]   Here's to the crazy ones type type of wine. Oh, that's the stuff van go drink. Right. Yes. Exactly. Okay
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:03.360]   It's great. We used to the crazy. I did I we insisted when we were in um
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.960]   Arl, I guess it was uh
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.400]   The cafe that he painted the night cafe is still there and they painted a bright yellow to look like the night cafe
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.640]   But it's still there and our guide said
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.760]   You can go there. Don't eat. Yeah
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.800]   So we went we had a cup of coffee there because I wanted to sit at the night cafe where vinson van go
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.840]   Yeah, and sat many times and then we went to the
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:32.800]   Asylum a little farther north where he was uh, he was incarcerated and later died and yeah, it was very moving
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.960]   Yeah, it was I'm a huge fan of his work
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.080]   Interesting
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.920]   Followed his beyond understanding one of the things that I get a kick-out
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.680]   We go to paris. It's like oh Hemingway used to drink here with his buddies and all this stuff
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.600]   And i'm like, you know what now it's a tourist trap
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.840]   Because gastronomate experiences we you will live like Hemingway for a week
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.680]   Right, and you won't go to the place where you know that and elbow your way through all the tourists where he
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:00.000]   Once was there. I still do that like when we were in venice. I went to the hotel chaprionna and I had to have a uh
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.400]   Hemingway daiquiri. I mean you just you kind of have to do that kind of i'm a huge uh moveable feast
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:11.280]   Yeah, fan. Me too. Hey when you move, I know you take a ring doorbell with you
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.040]   You might want to take this with you. This is our newest sponsor. It's called lighthouse
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.040]   And this is the camera for inside the house
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:27.040]   Now I know that a lot of people and i'll include my wife in this do not like the idea of a camera monitoring them while they're walking around in the house
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.320]   And that's one of the reasons we love the lighthouse. She loves the lighthouse in our house because
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.720]   It's smart
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.360]   Not just a camera. It's got a 3d sensor. It's it uses time of flight lydar
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.520]   To actually map the indoors where you are
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:51.280]   It sees the difference between people and pets inanimate objects. It does face recognition
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:56.480]   It's the only camera that understands that life is more than just a bunch of emotional alerts
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.200]   If you wouldn't I mean really truthfully, we I actually had a camera
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.360]   And I took it out
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:05.520]   Partly because lisa said I want it on she could see the blinking light but also because I was getting alerts
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.840]   I mentioned this before
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.960]   We had some a birthday party and we have two mile arboloons left over and it kept thinking there were people in the house
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.840]   It was just dumb my alarm balloons lighthouse is not fooled
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.480]   By my alarm balloons or anything else
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:24.960]   And when we get home we've set it up and it's very smart this way when it sees lisa or me come home
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:28.240]   It turns off the camera. So our privacy is respected
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:33.840]   You control the camera turn it on and off whenever you want or it'll turn itself off because it has a eye
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.080]   and
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.400]   Strong encryption for all your data. Of course
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.800]   Here's the cool thing
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.920]   There's no other camera like the lighthouse it can say I know you I know you I know you
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   But when I see this person in your house, I'm gonna let you know and you set this all up
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:57.040]   Uh, it will then send you an image with the person outlined it knows pets and it has an ai query language
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.720]   It's very powerful
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.040]   Show me when the kids got home after three o'clock and it knows
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:09.120]   You can weigh the kids can wave at it see this they can they can wave at it and the lighthouse will
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.280]   Ping me and we can have a conversation because light has not only has the cameras
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.000]   It has a speaker it has a microphone in it
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.560]   So we can talk to one another so even if you know you have a younger child that wants to say hi to mommy or daddy
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:26.800]   They can do that you can say if you don't see the kids by five p.m. On weekdays
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.960]   Let me know if you do see the kids home before school
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.640]   Let me know
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.520]   If you see the dog by itself in the living room, let me know if you don't see the dog
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:43.760]   After three p.m. Let me know an on and on and on this is incredibly sophisticated
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.000]   Lighthouse uses a I to notify you only when something important
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.640]   Happens and you get to say what's important and what's not important?
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.280]   No more false alerts because of shadows or pets or mile our balloons
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.480]   Go to light dot house to learn more and if you use the promo code twit you'll get 15 off

[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   This was for a long time a very limited
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:15.680]   Edition we had some just for our viewers now it is available for sale to 99 for the camera
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.920]   We have several
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.280]   And just $10 a month for the ai service that powers lighthouse

[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.160]   By the way, we got it before it was even out and it was in pre-production and it was in blue my mind
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.960]   So one of the scientists used
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.920]   Was a winner of the DARPA grand challenge, you know
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.560]   That's where they had the cars that drove themselves across the country and stuff like that very smart ai guys
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.440]   Light dot house you were stacy was the one that told me to get this actually now that I remember it
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.080]   I definitely have to get one of those for for my travels because I mean we're living in somebody else's house
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:03.280]   Yeah, and who knows who's actually that's a great idea, you know, I mean it's like I totally need one of those
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.160]   Fantastic. I love it. I'd give you this one, but
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:11.520]   That's mine. I would tell I would tell it to track. I want to keep track of all the balloons
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:15.920]   Mylar not mylar. I want to know what's happening. Tell me
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:21.280]   I'm afraid to come over to your house because your camera would see your old camera would think I was some gas bag like a mylar balloon and
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   You can actually say if a pet enters the house, it's not one of ours
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.880]   Wow, so so if a raccoon comes in through the doggy door bingo, which does actually does happen
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:36.080]   We we used it because we have a cat that's gone feral. I mentioned this before Hamilton
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.720]   Which is interesting because in the play Hamilton
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.680]   They talked about George Washington's wife having a feral cat named hamilton
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.120]   We shouldn't have named our cat hamilton because he went wild made what feral he said that name it's humiliating
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.400]   I'm out of here
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.440]   And we thought well
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.600]   We were very worried because we hadn't seen him in a week and then Lisa looked at the looked at the tape
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.320]   And he comes in right after we leave for work. Wow. He eats he knaps
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.080]   He likes the house. He just doesn't like you. He doesn't like us. I'm believable
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   And then he leaves before we get home and we have time stamps. I can it's like
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.880]   Dude, you're busted
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.200]   He doesn't understand it. He's saying it
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.560]   That's hilarious. Google has changed its search to
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.880]   favor
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   mobile indexing
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.360]   This is really kind of a measure of how the world has changed. Yep
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.640]   Uh, the company for a long time did only desktop
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.960]   sites
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.560]   They started experimenting November 2016 with even having an index at all of mobile
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.360]   Uh, and now
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.280]   mobile first
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.000]   You know this is this is very much the trend. I wrote a column
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.600]   I think a like a year ago or something like that talking about the desktop gettin
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.400]   Because with each passing month desktop gettin the desktop web
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:56.240]   Gets worse or or gets worse in comparison to the mobile web
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.000]   There are lots of apps that ship where they don't even bother to do a desktop version
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.600]   There are lots of things that you can do in mobile that you can't do in the desktop
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.920]   And I think on on the whole the balance of power including amp for example
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.360]   Uh
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.480]   The the mobile web is clearly better than the desktop web now
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.840]   And this just makes that even more of a phenomenon
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.160]   Yeah, the app experience. I was gonna say like most of my devices come with
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.880]   None of them can run out of browser
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.040]   They're they're all they're all app-based. Oh, isn't that interesting all the iot stuff, isn't it?
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.960]   You're right. They're very few. I mean there are a couple of other they don't even bother
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.960]   They don't yeah, there's nothing there for them. I never thought that makes sense because you're you're by a device
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.040]   You're like setting something up
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.520]   You know, you're gonna be on your phone and just deal with it
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.480]   Right
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:48.000]   And there are a lot of services that do have a website and they do have mobile apps and they roll out new features
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.440]   But this is only for the mobile apps the desktop version has to have the feature
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   Lots and lots of examples of that
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.840]   So it's a mobile first world and i'm just looking forward to the day when
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.440]   when
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:06.240]   Apples laptops are iowa run ios and all the all the so-called desktop stuff runs mobile operating systems
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.080]   Uh, that'll be a good day now stacy is it an example of the bro culture or is it a sample of the austin culture?
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:18.240]   That google's research team calls their speech systems the taco tron
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.160]   Uh, I don't know
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.120]   I'm gonna go with austin
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   Uh, well you were the one who told me about breakfast tacos
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.680]   Uh, the taco tron is apparently this is a blog post from yesterday
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.320]   Uh from google's research team
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.960]   About more
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:45.440]   Natural voices they've been working on this for a while right? This is really interesting and scary. Yeah, you want to hear some?
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.440]   Yeah, I think it's great. I don't think it's scary. Oh, uh, this is
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.200]   So I remember in the early days of speech sympathy you're old enough to remember this too
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:03:00.880]   You would if you wrote because it was I mean we've had speech synthesis for 30 years a long time you you could write
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.360]   Uh, when you wrote the text you could write in pauses you could write in inflections
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.440]   You would actually when you were writing speech tell it how to say it
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.800]   It still sounded crappy and like a robot, but at least it would go it would go up at the end of questions
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.360]   And it would pause with commas and stuff
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.640]   Um, so the idea is they now want to do this
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.840]   Uh independent of phonetic information and idiosyncratic speaker traits
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.880]   They stress intonation and timing and they're doing this with an inference engine
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.680]   So it isn't
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:42.720]   The way it's written they're actually well, it's not understanding but they're getting a lot closer understanding
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.360]   what they're saying so here is
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.360]   Well, it understands how most people say those phrases together both of the time
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.920]   Yeah, but but not based on the question mark or the commas, but really based on the content
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:02.800]   Yeah, so based on what words appear next to each other. Here's an australian version. Is that utah travel agency?
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.440]   So there's a difference between
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.840]   Is that utah travel agency or is that I I mean I you know we understand that that is that utah travel agency?
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.080]   That that's that sounds is that utah travel agency. So that's without prosody, which is what they're calling this
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.120]   That's how uh right now the google home would say it
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.360]   Is that utah travel agency and you have that experience where it's just a little clunky
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:31.280]   Maybe you don't even know why when google home says that this is with prosody is that utah travel agency?
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.760]   I don't know. I'm not sure what that's supposed to be about is that utah travel agency
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.480]   Just put nonsense words in there
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.040]   Let's try this one here is without prosody or prosody
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.520]   For the last time in his life, he had been handily embarrassed. That sounds pretty good
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.160]   Let's see if they do some
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:58.560]   prosody for the last time in his life. He had been handily embarrassed. That's much. Wow. It doesn't sound particularly american. That's a robot
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:05.440]   Holy can't let me play better. Let me so this is the without for the last time in his life
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.800]   He had been handily embarrassed by the way. The voice is very good. Yeah
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:14.240]   But it's a little weird because it's the two consistent is too
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:21.120]   Mono for the last time in his life. He had been handily embarrassed. That sounds like a human. That's fantastic
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.920]   That's an audible book reader. Yeah, that sounds like a human doing like a seventh grade play
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:28.960]   Okay, it's not perfect
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.760]   No, you're right. I know that's your best dramatic friend right there. That's like
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.840]   It sounds like a british actor trying to do the last time in his life
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:46.160]   So I say this is scary because the more naturalistic fake things we have out there the harder it gets to tell
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.840]   Real
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:53.520]   From manufactured and so that's that's I think this is cool. Do not get me wrong, but
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.240]   It's gonna be nice. Yeah to have better voices in our lives and stuff like that
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.800]   But I actually think I've been thinking a lot about this lately
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.200]   I think we need to start thinking about how we teach children to interact with machines
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.520]   There's a there's a turtle robot that came out and it's soul function
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.320]   I'll come up with the the name of it in a sec
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.920]   But it's soul function is to teach kids how to be nice to robots
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:21.600]   So basically it's this robot. No kids should not be nice to robots. Well, they're robots
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.040]   They should be nice to robots
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.240]   They'd be nice to toasters
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.000]   They should be nice to robots, but not because the robots have their feelings heard
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.960]   Because this is what it teaches at the rote the turtle gets upset and it withdraws into its shell if you're mean to it
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:39.360]   If you're nice to it it no, it's a machine why are somebody's property? That's why you shouldn't oh lord
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:44.640]   This is a slippery. Yeah, so I think I think we need this we need we should teach kids to not
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   Think that because something talks really well. It's got a
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.120]   Human mind in it. Yeah, that's gonna be hard to do because we're hard wired
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.880]   Right. I was about to say that is like what we do as people. Yes. It is
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.520]   All right, um
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.560]   Let's see prosody transfer from unseen speakers onto a single speaker
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.080]   Model this is from the paper itself
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:15.280]   Audio samples from towards end-to-end prosody transfer for expressive speech synthesis with taco tron
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.600]   That's a great name
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.080]   The page contains I know a set of audio samples in support of the conclusions in our paper
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.840]   We suggest that the reader listen to the samples in conjunction with reading the paper
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.480]   So I'm not gonna read the papers. So sorry all utterances were unseen in training
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.320]   So
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.320]   Oh, this is a complicated thing
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.440]   The idea is that you could record
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.820]   Uninflected real human speech not synthesis
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:49.840]   Uninflected and that the prosody train I think I'm gathering the prosody training would then deflect it appropriately
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.800]   Does that make sense? I think this is I think this is all text to speech
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.720]   So it's it's it's it's not um because it says this is a promising result as it paves the way for voice interaction designers
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.000]   To use their own voice to customize speech synthesis. Oh, yeah, I misunderstood
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.600]   So you would train it with the prosody information. It would use AI to say okay. This is how they talk
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.320]   so here we go here's another one this is
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.800]   with
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.480]   Ref without prosody and so first of all, this is a normal human
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.600]   Giving the prosody reference to the AI
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.840]   I've swallowed a polywog
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.560]   That's a real person. It says unseen american speaker. That is not an american accent
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.400]   Yeah, what what is happening?
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.480]   Okay, she's falling a polywog. Did you hear okay? That's a real human
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:44.160]   This is the speech synthesis without any reference. I've swallowed a polywog
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.720]   It's not bad
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.080]   But it's not as good as this i've swallowed a polywog
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.920]   That's amazing. That's pretty good. Yeah, it's not as good as the human i've swallowed a polywog
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.240]   I think it must have been trying to the american must have been trying to
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.840]   British who says i've swallowed a polywog anyway the last two were labeled as british
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.400]   Yeah, I think that's an error. That's just an error in the in the text. Okay
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.720]   So here's the text that they have to synthesize
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:22.240]   United Airlines 563 from los angeles to noranans has landed the robot will read that but they're going to now
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.720]   They're going to add inference time select or modify the combination weights for the tokens allowing us to force
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:35.440]   TACOTRON to use a specific speaking style without needing training from a human
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.640]   Okay. Yeah, that's let's try let's try a few of these
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.320]   United Airlines 563 from los angeles to new orlands has landed
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:53.280]   She sounds a little put out. Yeah united airlines 563 from los angeles to new orlands has landed
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.720]   I like that. There's a lot of mystery. I just want to point out that
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:03.360]   They're applying something like, you know weird or angry or lively to this and that's the interpretation
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.040]   This is all generated by computer without a human reference at all that last one was the agatha christy filter something yes
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.720]   United Airlines 563 from los angeles to new orlands has landed
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:27.760]   Okay, more this is fine. I don't know about you yet united airlines 563 from los angeles to new orlands has landed
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.440]   I don't want to hear that coming through the airport speaker. That's just you guys because it sounds
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.480]   This person has the same gravelly voice the whole time, which is really interesting. Did they just like that must be part of the programming
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:46.800]   Right. This is not the prosody part. This is the voice word. So they now have a ton yeah, takotron is gonna gravelly voice
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.680]   Okay, takotron is a smoker heavy smoker
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.360]   United Airlines 563 from los angeles to new orlands has landed
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:11:01.760]   Queen is a badly manning the speaker system. How does this work?
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   Oh
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:12.080]   God, okay, well, I don't know what to make out of this. I just wanted to play a bunch of funny samples
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.000]   It all falls into the category of pretty soon
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.320]   We won't be able to tell their machines doing it and and the fake news industry is gonna go audio and vis visual
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.280]   Just so we are clear here takotron
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:33.440]   Unrelated takotron is an AI system that uses neural networks trained to mimic human speech
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:38.480]   So it is completely computer generated. I think it is kind of amazing
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.520]   I do so maybe that's where the gravel comes from stacy is that you know those weird neural network dream
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.120]   images. Uh-huh. That's the oral equivalent of
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.080]   gravel right dream images
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.720]   Although
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.680]   Although the others maybe our british accent is the oral equivalent. Yeah, maybe that's it
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.240]   Yeah, because we don't know what they trained it with
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.000]   So
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.520]   The problem they were trying to solve is that takotron sounds human
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.600]   But the inflections sounded a little mechanical and frankly i'm with you stacy
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.680]   I think there's going to be a law
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.720]   That says you can't make it too human because that's not good. You could impersonate
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.200]   I mean they could make it sound like me
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.960]   and the thing is
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.160]   imagine what could happen if they took the takotron and
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.920]   Did the voice and made it sound like my boy trained it with
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.360]   I don't know where they get 20,000 samples of my voice, but train it with 20,000 samples of my voice and then
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.040]   Did he get a human to go through my different speech patterns? If that's leo angry. That's leo lively
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.640]   That's leo sad and and then they could apply that to the text
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   I think they wouldn't need a human. It's unsuper. I mean, isn't it uh, the prosody is well. Oh, you're right
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.680]   With the so we gave you two examples one trained by a human
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.480]   From a human reference and one without reference and the one without reference was the polywalk
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.640]   That was the weird kind of weird one, but the one with reference was kind of surprisingly good
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.760]   I know I think this is fascinating and I think you're right stacy. It's a little troubling
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.640]   It has the potential to be troubling hold on technopinic
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.760]   But think about it remember what do now? I don't know how genuine this was but remember it went around last year
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.280]   that there was uh that that you would get a call from a
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.920]   Recording voice that the only purpose of the recording was to get you to say yes
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.120]   And then they were oh it would assign you up for long distance service. Yeah, it was like
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.760]   uh is uh, who is is
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.080]   Am I talking to somebody right now and you say yes and they'd read and then they'd hang up and they'd record the yes
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:49.200]   And then they would yeah, they would sign you over stuff. That's like the long distance company called I don't care
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.880]   Right back in the day. Yeah, but who needs that if you've got
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.760]   Taco Tron to and pros it right now with pros ity am I saying that right
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:03.040]   Could be pros ity because it's pros you went to uh harvard. What do you think uh
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.560]   He says i'm saying it right
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.720]   That's what harvard says harvard's like goosey
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.080]   That's google pro sitty pro sitty
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.480]   Pro sitty because it's pros right it's from pros is the root word
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:24.400]   Prosity is the pattern of rhythm and sound used in poetry. Yeah, you know um pro sitty back in the day
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.720]   We at every legal every time we talked about legal issues on this show and other shows
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.760]   We'd talk about the good wife because it was so relevant right now
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.120]   The the follow on to that is an even better show called good fight you watch that and the most recent episode had this
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:43.920]   Very technology where the lawyer tried to trick them into doing something by using a faked voice and all this kind of stuff
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.400]   They are so relevant. It's unbelievable and they're they're dead on to what's happening like
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.520]   You know something happens and then two weeks later. They got a show
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.120]   Yeah, it deals like it's rich from that tech has ripped
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.880]   It's and and they're very there's a lot of tech in it too. So it's like it's really fascinating. They have like what it
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.200]   What is it like uh, they've got some fake google company that they've you know
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.120]   Uh, it's really good. It's really really good. So
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:16.560]   It's the easiest thing in the world. I mean that we talk about faking photographs, but he faking a voice with this kind of thing would be easy
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.680]   Yeah
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.800]   Yeah, so I guess just as we do not trust
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:26.160]   Uh photographs anymore. Don't trust voice anymore. Yeah, definitely not
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.440]   And soon we will not be trusting video
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.960]   Yeah
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:35.760]   Yeah, that's the hardest one though. I mean even if you watched those what were they called the
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.280]   The pornos with somebody else's face. Oh, right. Um, yeah
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.240]   The fakes those were I was hard to do and it was hard to do well and they didn't look that real
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.000]   They couldn't even get superman's mustache removed properly. Exactly
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.400]   They will get there. They'll get that
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.040]   I was get there. No question
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.320]   But yes deep fakes. That's what it was fake. Yeah, um, I because I and you had to pick some
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.320]   You had to match the faces pretty closely. It was imperfect. Yeah, but it will become perfect
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.400]   I mean, there's no doubt this this is the thing that you know, I when there's specific information about progress in this realm
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.080]   That's not that doesn't freak me out
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.040]   More than the certainty that it's only a matter of time before all the stuff is perfected voice video at all be perfected
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.040]   It's only matter. We have to adjust
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:31.360]   Although think about what that means for biometrics. There's some interesting like what can you do from a voice?
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.200]   Well
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:41.120]   Presumably you can it's just how how accurate will it be how accurate can you bake these in what are the ways to like
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.600]   I guess hack these neural networks
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.280]   So like if you replace, you know a pixel on the face or if you use different if you're using a picture or if you
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.200]   Put weird makeup on so surveillance can't understand who you are
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   There are ways to
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.680]   Go against these systems is just we've got to figure with that. What does ours? I was really shocked. I uh
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.640]   My mom
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.360]   I don't know. I guess I should use this I shouldn't say which I won't say the name because I don't want to give out too much information about my mom
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.240]   but uh uses a online brokerage and
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.440]   One of the ways of authenticating was your voice
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.640]   And I told her and don't do that. Yeah, that just does not seem like a good idea
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.680]   Not that I could sound like my mom, but it just uh it feels like that's not a secure
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.480]   I know even now I don't think that's a very secure thing to do
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.360]   Ah
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.840]   Facebook is being investigated by the ftc there was some question about
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:44.720]   Facebook had had uh a consent decree right in 2011 right with the ftc and there was some question whether this came regenalitica
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.520]   data release
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.320]   Violated that consent decree
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040]   ftc has now uh
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:58.160]   Hasn't said whether it's well, let me let me see they hadn't said but now it's
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:04.000]   Confirmed on monday that the ftc is investigating facebook's
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.640]   data practices and
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.080]   Uh, even though they didn't confirm it last week. They have now confirmed it and
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.160]   By the way, it's private. It's a private non-public investigation
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:23.760]   The penalty of the consent decree is 40 thousand dollars per violation, which means per user
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.120]   50 million times 40 thousand dollars is how much
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.320]   I can't even go that high
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.760]   That's a lot. That's a lot of money
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.600]   Um, but it's not gonna happen. So here's it here's a dark mechanical
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.520]   A billion
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   Right. What is it? It's a big number
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.720]   Yeah, you're gonna have to take a chat room 50 million times
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.720]   Thousand dollars. What is that how much money? Yeah, that can you take a check the chat room stopped because everybody's like working
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   But here's here's a question for you that that makes me really nervous are
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:02.000]   Congressional investigators going to be pulling their punches. This is a quote non-public
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.160]   Investigation already there they're going soft on facebook before they even begun they're making it non-public
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:14.800]   Are they gonna go soft on them because they know that facebook can just with a little bit of lines of code make sure they never get elected?
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:21.120]   They have that power huge power huge power and conversely with a little bit of lines of code maybe make zucth president
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.600]   Yeah, absolutely. Although he why would he why would he want the less power than he has now?
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.360]   What is that in house of cards many years ago? Yeah, was that a plot?
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.440]   Supply it feels like it. Yeah
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.480]   two trillion dollars
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.960]   Two oh, that's that's not true. You could have to make me you could fund two wars in iraq for that. That's right. That's right two
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.760]   trillion dollars
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.880]   That it really helped go a long way towards settling the deficit. Yeah
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.240]   I have the feeling that they're gonna get a stop on the wrist and it'll be businesses. They're gonna be a two trillion dollar
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.240]   Fine, I go I can assure you
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:01.440]   Maybe we could get um so mebble will get something like gdpr here in that because facebook's gonna
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.560]   because a lot of tech companies already have to
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.720]   Work towards those goals anyway and build those systems
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.520]   Maybe we'll see them acquiesce to something like that here in the us. They might lead the way
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:20.080]   Uh, so I can't even testify april 12th by the way, uh for college. That's my birthday. Happy birthday
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:25.120]   It's your birthday gift from facebook mark succubur. I can find out exactly
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.440]   What they're doing or just watch him get yelled at so here's what's happening in menlo park
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.200]   They're coaching zuc on how to seem like a like a normal human
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.680]   Because his inclination would be to answer everything just like you know, he's like data from star trek
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.000]   And it worked with the taco tron too mark you should try prosody
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.920]   So they're coaching him on how to with prosody express feelings and and all I am sorry
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.240]   I
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.080]   Need to do it
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.200]   Some of this is going to be great for the screen. Are you yawning my great humor and made you yawn?

[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.520]   I'm sorry. We shouldn't pile on mark because frankly
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:43.760]   Everybody's doing it. Everybody's doing it. He's that is not a good excuse if everyone jumps off a bridge
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.400]   Yes, mom. It'll be fine
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:53.040]   Well, and I think his perspective in life has probably changed some over time now that he has a kid
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:58.480]   Right now he's food that he didn't kill. You know all those youtube videos we saw in the world serious
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.040]   Get ready again be a finals
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.320]   same thing
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320]   really play buttons on uh shacks butt
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.160]   I don't know a shack even in it. I don't does even play anymore
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.320]   I don't even know. I'm so I'm already without outdated basketball reference
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:19.280]   By the way, if you do feel sympathy for mr. Z you're not alone
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.440]   Tim burners lee
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   the creator of the world wide web
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:33.520]   Says I can imagine mark zuckerberg is devastated that his creation has been abused and misused
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:41.040]   Some days just sad because the web is the broken he does because some days I have the same feeling hashtag
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.640]   Just saying
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.240]   Not a humble brag. It's humble empathy. What is that humble empathy?
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:53.680]   Yeah, I invented something massive that everybody uses and you know, I've lost control of it too mark. I know how you feel. Yeah. Yeah
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:58.480]   That is a humble brag. You're right. You nailed it. It's a humble brag
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:05.840]   Oh my god, Tim. I am excited about this. There is a great sci-fi a novel out of china that you
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.440]   mr
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   John slonina got me to read called the three body problem, right?
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.840]   Amazon
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.160]   Is earmarking one billion dollars to make
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:26.320]   The three body problem into a blockbuster sci-fi series. There's a trilogy. I've read this too. Yes
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   It's a fascinating book
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:34.800]   Uh, and it will make a it'll be better than game of thrones. I could see why amazon wants to put a billion dollars towards
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:39.280]   This just comes from the financial times, but one billion dollars is not to make it
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.840]   One billion dollars is to acquire the rights to it
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.960]   dear wow
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.600]   Dan i'm gonna write me a novel
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.400]   I
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.160]   Write one called the four body problems. I should get a billion and a quarter for that here is
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:04.640]   That's the other public like it can't pick something else pop it. How much how much how much are
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.080]   Again, that's a lot of greek fishermen hats. That's yeah, I mean wow
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.640]   Here's a picture of the author of the three body problem
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.680]   uh, leo qi shin
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:22.880]   Soon he'll be a robot. He's a toilet. I don't know. I don't know why
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   He chose this is his publicity
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:31.600]   Phone over there is a mechanical man sitting on a toilet next to him. I don't I'm puzzled
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.640]   I'm sure it means something. I didn't finish it. Does this show up in the book? Uh, john? No
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:43.120]   Just one of the bodies is doing that you know what if they spent a billion to the rights there
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.480]   Making this could cost a billion right stacey. I mean this has
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.760]   Egypt in it. It has other worlds. It has I mean this thing is amazing
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.080]   There is a lot happening there. So yeah, um
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:02.080]   Yeah, I'm trying to find the rights for other things and i'm not i'm not my googling skills are
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.960]   impaired. They're not so good. You're impaired right now. Go get some coffee. I'm gonna do an ad
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.000]   I'm just gonna sit here staring into space. Yeah
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.840]   Okay
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.880]   I'll be a bock. Shoulda be a bock, ladies and gentlemen. So will we
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.760]   With the thrilling gripping conclusion
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.320]   Of this week in google, but first a word from our sponsor
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.720]   On all of this sponsor. Let me tell you rocket mortgage
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:34.000]   Look if you uh, if you are buying a house, you know that most people unlike zuck are not writing a check
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   For the house
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.720]   You're going to be getting the home loan, right? And I got to tell you if you've done this before you'll remember
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   It is not a fun process. You got to get all dressed up. Go to the bank
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:52.400]   Say, please may I have a large amount of money and the bank they're nice about it. I'll say well of course, but first
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:26:00.400]   Here's a 20 page application and we'll be in touch. So you fill the thing out you go home
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.680]   Then they call you or they send you an email or they
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.040]   Usually they send a pony express messenger
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:13.920]   Because it's really stuck in the 18th century here and they say well we need this this and this can you fax it to us?
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.800]   Okay, let me find a fax machine
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:23.040]   Then let me find the pay stubs for 2012 or the bank statements from 2011 or whatever it is and it's they and that's uh
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.640]   The last time I bought a house. It wasn't even the end of it. We just took two months
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.320]   This was back in 2011 took two months. They kept it coming back for more and more
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.520]   We were on vacation. We had a call at least his sister debbie to say could you fax them some stuff?
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.320]   Fortunately, we have a fax machine for some reason in the office. I don't know what normal people do
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.200]   Go down to the kinkos
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   But
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.280]   You know what here's what normal people do they don't do it
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:55.600]   They don't go there anymore. They go to rocket mortgage from quick and loans quick and loans the number one lender in the country number one in customer satisfaction
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:01.360]   Year after year after year according to jd power and they have decided to make this a modern process
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.320]   They call it rocket mortgage quick and loans
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:12.240]   To the rescue rocket mortgage makes it easy. They give you the confidence you need when buying a home or I should say refinancing
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.080]   As interest rates go up. This is also an interesting thing you might want to do
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.840]   You can understand every step of the way because it's very simple you do this on your phone or your laptop or your tablet
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.800]   Do it. Let's say you're an open house. Let's say you say I want to buy this house
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.040]   This is unheard of you would this would never would have happened a couple of years ago
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.640]   You open your phone up. You go to rocket mortgage.com/twig
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:39.120]   You answer some simple questions. You don't even have to like look stuff up. You know, you know name address birth date that kind of thing

[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:21.360]   I almost became a teacher, but that's really expensive and I don't actually want to teach people

[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:59.120]   Talking about abuse of women on twitter
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.200]   Yeah
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.640]   Actually, all you have to really do is go on twitter and you can find a little bit of that
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.760]   hashtag toxic twitter the issue is
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.480]   Is
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.680]   There an issue is this free speech or is twitter failing to
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:22.080]   Implement its own policies to protect women on the platform
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.800]   and um
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.640]   amnesty international
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.600]   Says twitter has not taken sufficient steps to effectively and adequately to address reports
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.600]   of violence and abuse and
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.160]   most importantly implement its own
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.360]   Guidelines, let's take you go first because I have a prepared statement
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.600]   I kind of want to hear your prepared statement and then I can respond to that
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:52.400]   Okay, so the pro okay by the way, it's not just women the research highlights the experiences of violence abuse against women of color women from ethnic or religious minorities lesbian
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.800]   bisexual transgender women non binary individuals women with disabilities
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.760]   everybody basically except white men
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.360]   And they're they're not having a great time on twitter sometimes either. Yeah
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.120]   Uh, so first of all, I love twitter. I use it heavily
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:14.080]   And uh, and they do have problems their problems and i've said this on this show before stem from the fact that twitter won't give up control
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.280]   Of moderation right on every other social network you can delete
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.680]   Other people's comments
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.600]   When they invade your conversation with trolling and harassment and hate speech
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:30.000]   Whereas on twitter you have to go to twitter itself and beg them and plead with them to take action and they'll go
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:36.480]   Nah, doesn't know i'm stuck to them and they have to they have to sit there and go after every needle in every haystack
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:42.480]   Whereas on other social networks you can just go and delete the offending comments and it has a big effect on knocking down
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:46.080]   People the trolls gravitate to twitter for this reason
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:52.720]   Twitter specifically is not giving the information amnesty international wants about its reporting process and content moderation
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.760]   They're not even telling them how it works let alone making it work. It's another black box
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.760]   They're they're once again using ignorance
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:05.120]   Uh to their advantage. Uh, they claim free speech, but but really this is a huge huge problem
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:10.880]   I think it's a big problem for the tech press because the tech press is the most vocal champion of twitter
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:16.000]   And it's probably half of the users. Yeah, the press in general
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.480]   I mean other outside the tech press a journalist political journalists are heavy user twitter as well
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:25.440]   But the tech press itself is the one who's always going yeah twitter's, you know, heavy users of it and
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.200]   You were talking on on twit the other day. Um, I think
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:36.640]   Somebody brought up the fact that I was having that I was championing google plus saying this facebook thing is a real opportunity for google plus
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.640]   And I said well good we're getting my gun twig today
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.120]   That's right. And so and so the the in fact what I did was I I do
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.680]   I tried to do what you do on this show all the time is start a conversation with smart people so we're gonna learn something
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.960]   I love that and so I
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.480]   Crit created post on google plus saying hey is this is the facebook's problems?
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.960]   Create an opportunity for google plus to have a resurgence and then I went to twitter and I said hey everybody go talk on google plus about this
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:01.520]   conversation because we're having this big conversation and
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.120]   That's what I did and people on google plus they're like we don't want the facebook people
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.640]   We got a good thing going here. Please don't have don't actually google plus has been much better since everybody left it
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.920]   Yeah, yeah, exactly and so this is but this is the thing
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:17.440]   So the tech press the way the tech press and I understand why they do it
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:23.440]   But the tech press doesn't actually use arguments to dismiss google plus they use
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.640]   Snide or everybody knows the google plus is nothing
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:32.960]   Right, so probably this audience for twig probably 25 percent of your audience uses google plus to great effect
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.400]   There are great conversations. There's there are lots of problems on google plus
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.440]   Lots of problems on twitter lots of problems on facebook
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:46.640]   But what I was trying to convince the twitter a t to embrace is the reason to to use a social
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.960]   The reason to advocate a social network is not because everybody's there
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.400]   That's why we have facebook everybody's on facebook because everybody's on facebook and nobody's on google plus because nobody's on google plus
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.320]   Those are not good reasons
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.720]   In fact you talk about moderation google plus has a new feature that's barely been mentioned
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:09.600]   This is the greatest feature that ever existed on any social network in history with a single click you can block report
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.760]   and delete
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.440]   a comment
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.280]   One click all three of those things happen and then on the way out
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:20.640]   It says do you also want to delete all their recent comments and you say yes
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.840]   And it's like the most it's like wow that's nice. It's like it's like I might go that
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:31.920]   Glitterates the trolls and the haters and it just eliminates all of it's been a spam problem lately though on google plus
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:37.760]   But this is the thing you have to use that feature use it a little bit and pretty soon. It's like it'll go away
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.520]   Yeah, all right. And so
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.800]   Again, I'm not saying that google plus is the greatest thing in the world. I actually use twitter more than google plus so I am also a hypocrite
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.560]   but
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:48.800]   Let's be clear about why we recommend
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.520]   You know people talk about mastodon right mastodon is like this wonderful place. We're all supposed to go
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.160]   Okay, if you're gonna disk google plus for not having users google plus has way more users
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:05.200]   And way more engagement way more activity recently they'll eat it all my circles because I was getting google plus circles in my
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:11.040]   Contact. Yeah, yeah, but I don't think you need circles really right they've kind of moved away from circles. Yeah
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:16.720]   Go ahead. So that was that was creepy weird. Um, okay, so back to twitter. I'm gonna say
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.680]   My thought on all of this is it's the same
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:24.320]   They've created essentially what is a public square
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:29.360]   And anytime people who are not the majority go into a public square
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.600]   There is a risk. I mean you see people being cat called and that sort of thing
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320]   Twitter's problem is
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.720]   That no one can step up much like mike said no one can step up and say hey
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.320]   Yeah, we don't do that here. We don't treat people like that way here
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.560]   So there's no moderation and then twitter itself doesn't have you know if something gets really egregious you can call the cops
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.680]   And twitter you can't call the cops on twitter
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.960]   You don't even know really what the rules are that they're gonna follow and when they follow the rules
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.440]   They do it unevenly and it's disturbing and people
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:08.000]   Complain because they're like it's the public square. I could be as much of a jerk as I want in the public square
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.200]   but
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.920]   That's not actually true because we have rules and
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:18.160]   We have rules and then we have society morals and basically one can't be enforced on twitter
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.400]   And one twitter doesn't want to take the role of enforcing on so that's that's the problem
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:28.480]   So yeah, I say twitter's a hostile place for lots of people. Yeah, I reported like 20 25
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.800]   User accounts on twitter where they're using my profile picture and my name
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.560]   And said they and twitter said no, they don't violate our terms of service. Those are those are all parody accounts
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.720]   Even though many of them had never posted anything
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.680]   And it's a party accounts too
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.520]   I don't know how many it is, but it's a lot if you search for my name you'll get lots of
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:54.640]   Unfortunate because it's really because of twit well probably but but the but the but the point is what's the point of verification?
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:59.920]   If it doesn't protect you from people copying your name and your face and and so anyway
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:05.840]   So it's just they have serious problems that don't address and the way to address those problems is give users more control
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.920]   I think and I think that would help a lot
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.200]   This is why I can't quit twitter
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.240]   Brianna woos tweet
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:23.120]   Really impressed with the graphics and far cry five the fictional game about white supremacist taking over america's feels so realistic
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.200]   Great job will be soft
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.840]   But of course those are images from charlotte's bad
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.680]   I love you Brianna
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:41.440]   Wow, she's by the way big interview in the new york times. Oh really with Brianna will and how she's changing the democratic playbook
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:47.600]   That's gonna be exciting. I'd love to see a lot more nerds running for office. Not me. I'm not doing it
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.880]   Nope. I got a good thing going if you think twitter's bad try running for office. Exactly. Yeah, exactly
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.520]   but but twitter is the is the
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:58.400]   world is the greatest place in the world for snark and
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:05.680]   Yeah, it's actually it's so I love I know I know but I love twitter. I follow
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.400]   The nerdiest people. Yeah, if you are not following like the real scientist account
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.480]   I don't know what you're doing with your life
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.080]   but you can
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:17.920]   Learn so much and there's I find a lot of good conversations and I think
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.000]   I don't know. I mean every now and then I get somebody who's like a jerk to me, but you know
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:30.960]   I just delete them and move on. I have to I really probably should just unfollow everybody and recreate my twitter list
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.240]   But I did find a hack a life hack that works very well for me
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:41.680]   I use tweet deck which is so far still a very good service even though twitter completely ignores it tweet deck dot twitter.com
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:44.000]   And what I have learned
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.960]   Is that and this is actually I wish a tool twitter would give you but they only give it to you in
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.080]   tweet deck you can exclude retweets
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.560]   Yeah, so a lot of the problem on twitter is just this kind of
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.040]   like three quarters of the traffic on a twitter feed is people retweeting
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:07.040]   And off often somebody pointed this out and I think it's really true retweets are the most
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.760]   Obnoxious content the stuff that got people to go retweet the most outraged the most you know
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.760]   It's this so sometimes retweets are good
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:21.040]   But but but now my home stream and by the way the other thing tweet deck does which is nice as it's live
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.000]   Yeah, so it continues to scroll my home stream
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.960]   Is retweet free and that is really slow a slowed it down. Yeah and and be focused it
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:36.720]   So the next thing is and I keep saying this I'm gonna just sit here and watch it when I when I see something
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:43.200]   Person I don't want to follow in that feed because I followed him, but I shouldn't have I'm gonna I'm gonna start
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.480]   Unfollowing, but I haven't done what I'd love to do
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:48.560]   So I have I have two main account
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:52.320]   I have one account that I use for following and I have another account that I use for just
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.920]   People follow me basically and for me to engage in this system before you and I have multiple
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.360]   That gets really complicated
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.320]   But basically I I'm very careful about who I follow because I don't want to firehose of not of nonsense
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.400]   And some of the people I want to follow
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.920]   Post a lot of nonsense
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.760]   um, and so
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.120]   That's the trick one of the things it's great about nobody's consistently interesting
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.560]   I mean one of the great things about twitter is that you can say okay
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.080]   I want to follow all these people but mute the following words. I want to mute
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.360]   Stuff about politics. I want to mute stuff about sports
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.160]   In my case and just get tech right right and that's a beautiful thing
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.280]   Unfortunately, I don't think that conveys over to the third party clients
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.160]   I use twitter bot or one of those others that's like tweet tweet deck and it doesn't
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.880]   Those mute filters don't apply on the third party clients. I'd love for them to apply
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:44.240]   So I've got kind of oh you need a better api integration then
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.400]   Exactly or maybe twitter needs a better api
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.760]   I would if it weren't copyrighted exactly
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:54.320]   You know that may be an end game for me is to write my own twitter client, you know?
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.280]   Yeah
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.160]   All you need four more years of computer science classes and i'll be ready. You could call it twitter
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.880]   Oh wait, oh no, sorry
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.480]   That's a sore spot. I know
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.760]   All right, now i know i feel bad about wanting i am no longer the jerk on this show
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.600]   He's gonna go with you to get botox. No, I need botox all right stacey higgetbotham
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.320]   You're sing of the week, please. Oh, we're already there. Yes. I want to let you off the hook
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.160]   Oh, no, i'm sorry. I'm fine. I just took a
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.880]   I know a drug. I know
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:34.160]   Oh, well if you want to keep going but i think we should i think this is an hour 41 in we're done
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.960]   We're done. Oh man. The time has flown by. I know what is it. What's in the box stacey
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.680]   A lot of stuff. Hold on
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.960]   This just came this you just just just arrived. Yes, okay
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.360]   This is just in this literally just in
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:57.520]   Okay, sorry about the camera. I'm so excited. Okay. This is which you the nest
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:03.120]   Video doorbell. Oh, so everybody was talking about this nest just released this
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.080]   Yeah, this just came out
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.160]   let's
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:11.440]   Do a little informal unboxing gear. I have to unbox higher than my head
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:17.280]   I have to say it's it's cute looking and it follows the nest aesthetics all of the nest stuff kind of looks the nest
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   Thetics aesthetics. Oh nice. I don't know. Do I want shiny piano black on my front door? Okay. Well, I'm sure they have other colors
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.320]   Whoo so sparkly
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.600]   Oh, that is really nice though. Look how small that is yeah
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:38.000]   Um, okay, so it's got screw so you mount it you could mount it and replace your existing doorbell. Okay
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.880]   Yes, I'm sorry. I'm getting no still working. This is $229
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:47.280]   Okay, I hate this. This is my personal pet peeve. They're like
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:53.520]   Go to the app to install the ends is to figure out the installation so many. Yeah, you have to yeah
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:58.400]   I that's I see that more and more right. We don't want to waste. We don't want to kill trees. We're just gonna
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:04.160]   Get the yeah, I just want to see okay. So I'm trying to figure out but you're gonna have to get the app anyway
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.120]   I I know but mash potatoes says it looks like a big dash button
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:14.240]   That's actually pretty apt. It is kind of like okay. So here's the mountain
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:20.400]   All the mounting hardware is metal you guys. This is not plastic. This is metal
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.520]   That's actually really nice. Um
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.880]   Okay, so this is the thing is gonna mount to your door and it's gonna slide in there
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.040]   Here are my wiring. I'm thinking this is for my doorbell
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.520]   Oh, look. There's a wire harness good norm good lord
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.680]   Well, no, because this doesn't fit on the back here, which like the ring they do a bypass
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.160]   Yeah, this is a sticker. So this is gonna go inside my actual doorbell
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.320]   Uh, oh
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.960]   The bell doesn't do a bypass the ring wires itself as a regular doorbell
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.720]   Uh the ring pro actually the new one does okay
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:04.160]   The new one wires as a bypass because otherwise when you hit the motion if the motion sensor goes off
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.400]   It would actually um dong
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.520]   Yeah
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.440]   I don't have that problem at home. My doorbell does not ring when somebody walks up to the doorbell
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.640]   They have to press the button
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.880]   So I don't know what ring did we should mention rings is sponsored just as long as we're saying the word ring
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.840]   Oh, yes. Yes, um, okay. Oh, yeah, and actually this week. This was our my show too
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.040]   So I am also sponsored by ring just but just to show our
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.000]   editorial excellence
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.800]   Okay, so we are not we were going to be completely
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.600]   Objective about this horrific
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.560]   competitor to our fine sponsor
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.800]   Well, we are so I can't unscrew it for them because I don't have do I have my little mini screwdriver hold on
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.000]   Grew up. So they're gonna work with the g- nest has said because they're google
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.840]   They're gonna work with the google home mini and the min- oh, this is interesting
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.600]   Not only with your doorbell ring the home mini will say someone's at the door
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.280]   I'm sorry
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.280]   Someone's at the door
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.920]   Well, I think it's also going to
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.400]   Actually kind of want that
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:09.920]   Can I have golem say someone said oh you mean like show up on your tv like you'll see a picture on your tv all of a sudden if somebody at the door
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:12.640]   I think that was the thought process
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.680]   I like it because you could do it already on chromecast with your um
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.880]   Right
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.520]   You have to call it up. You can't do it. You have to say google home
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:28.880]   Show who's on who's at the door on my nest on my living from tv and by that time they've gone away
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:32.000]   So this would be if it's a little more automatic
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:41.360]   Uh 24/7 streaming continuous video recording that's something nest does with their cameras and that's something that others do not do
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.120]   for
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:49.360]   By three hd video showing people from head to toe. That's just what we call a in the business a wide angle lens
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.960]   jargon hdr video shows sharp details even in bright and dark areas
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:02.080]   Person motion and sound alerts to detect visitors can recognize family and friends and send a special alert. That's kind of cool
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:08.000]   That's like that uh lighthouse. So it has face right but but you know my experience with the nests
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.880]   IQ and face recognition it never learned anybody's face ever
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:20.640]   That's the one that saw the mylar balloons and that's the same probably the same technology. It's exactly the same pre-recorded quick responses. Oh wait a minute
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.560]   What is that pre-recorded quick response go away? Oh?
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.600]   Yes, that's what that is. I just ate a polywog
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:32.720]   I think it was swallowed a
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.840]   Okay, I'll add that if I can
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:40.800]   But I just swallowed a polywog
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:48.000]   Oh my god. All right. Well, we will you know what next week will you uh be will that be enough time for you to review this?
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.400]   Oh, yes. All right. Oh, look. I'm adding it to my app using the scan the code. Okay
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:57.360]   Yeah, I like that on the nest cams do that too. They have a barcode on the back and you can just add it very easily although
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.080]   It doesn't see it very well
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.120]   Because the barcode is not
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.280]   Not the best. Yeah
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:10.800]   Maybe it's on the ball. That's all the only thing don't like about that is if you want to change the Wi-Fi or whatever
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.920]   You've got to go outside unscrew the doorbell
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.720]   Skint rescan it's a bit of a process
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:20.000]   Uh to do that, but but I guess that's probably a good thing
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.920]   With my ring video doorbell what I do I sponsor I um, I have I don't use the screws
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.520]   I just basically slide in and I use tape on the top so it doesn't slip out. That's a great idea
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.920]   And then I just rip off the tape. Nobody's ever stolen it. No, never what would anybody do with it anyway?
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:36.480]   Let's steal this guy's doorbell
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:42.320]   Actually, this is a pathetic kind of vandalism when I was living in Mexico for some reason everywhere I live
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.200]   Like people ignore it completely except in Mexico
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.680]   Everyone who came to the doorbell and lots of people come to your house
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.040]   To sure in Mexico because they're selling water. They're doing that
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:55.680]   And every single person to a person was just like looking at it and they're like wow
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.160]   That's fascinating and they're having a lot of video of Mexicans like looking at your bill by my doorbell
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.640]   Yeah, but nobody's ever stolen it. Maybe we don't need a wall. We could just put doorbells along the border
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.360]   Exactly. Oh and they could ring if they want if they want to immigrate they can ring the bell
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.240]   And then if that was
[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:17.360]   Sorry, this is I am like in set it mode. I'm like, you're totally an iot
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:23.680]   This is Stacy on iot mode is what this is. This is me. This is me in real life. Sorry you guys. No, you know what?
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.200]   You're
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.080]   I that's why we love you Stacy. You're a complete nutter nerd
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.360]   Just just a nerd
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.520]   Like that's that's true. So
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:39.280]   Oh, wow, this says it's going to require 45 minutes and require a drill. I'm excited. Okay
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.400]   It's gonna be a long time. I also got so I will do this for you guys
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.840]   So next week we'll be able to talk about this and then you know what you could do
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.080]   You don't have to put it on your front door. You could put it on your office door
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:54.240]   So I can't actually put anything well, I'm gonna set it up on my
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:50:00.800]   Oh, this is this is my issue. This is a personal issue though that everyone has that but i've got the new i'll show you this
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.920]   I also got wait. There's more
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.120]   It's a key contest. Oh, I didn't know they had this
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:12.320]   Oh, man. We've been waiting for this for like two years. I didn't even know about this one
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.800]   Yeah, this is their yale lock that's going to I think work with the doorbell
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:22.960]   Most locks are made for keys says nest this lock is made for people actually
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:25.520]   Technically it's made for people with fingers
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:28.720]   Technically, yes
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:31.040]   Comes in nickel
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   oil rubbed bronze
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.400]   Oh, I have sat nickel or pat polish brass
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:42.720]   Yeah, the back side looks like this just so you know, so it's not as this is like the schleg though and other
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.360]   locks, right? It's a dead bolt that you can open
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:53.200]   Yes, does it also unlock with bluetooth proximity? Oh, I hope not because that's I think dangerous. I don't like that
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:56.880]   Uh key free connected so it will unlock with
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:03.200]   The pad or bluetooth you can control it from your nest. Oh, wait a minute. Okay. This is the deal breaker kids
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:10.400]   And if your lock loses power you can quickly charge it with a nine volt battery to unlock the door
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:15.440]   So that's actually uncomplant because that's actually a big complaint for the august guys
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:21.360]   Um because and here's why these things lose their battery power really quickly and
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:24.960]   Oftentimes they lose it in the dead of winter when it's super cold
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.760]   And you don't want to change it so people just keep ignoring it
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.440]   I am not going to buy something that I have to unlock with a nine
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.840]   And the i have to buy that one. Yeah in my pocket. Oh, honey
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.640]   I can't get in i'm gonna go to the store and get a nine volt battery. I'll be right back
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.720]   This is ridiculous
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.960]   Well, this is why I
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:48.400]   I'm like, yeah, okay
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.720]   Doesn't look like it has bluetooth. It also works with their nest secure alarm boy
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:56.240]   You know from a company that had no products for like five years
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:00.080]   Like all they did was a thermostat suddenly this is overwhelming
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.080]   They've just that's good. They got rid of that guy
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.400]   Whatever it was was it fidelity at all tony fidelity was slowing it down or
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:13.280]   It was it's good. They put him in uh got him out of alphabet and put him in google. I think is really what happened. Yeah
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:21.520]   Holy cow thermostats cameras doorbells alarm systems locks smoke and carbon monoxide alarm all new products. Wow
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.200]   The smoke the smoke
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:29.840]   Tony yeah, they took that off the market though because you could wave at it and disable it forever
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:35.520]   Well, they brought all the security stuff out because originally no one knew what the smart home was going to be like
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.520]   The thing that people pay for is security right right
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.800]   That's that's the number one that in lights. Yeah
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:47.760]   People actually that's the third use case. So the number one use case has been security
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:52.800]   Um, the second is energy efficiency and finally is automation in lights
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:57.600]   You know, but the thing is the thing is that if you compare the world of lights and how it's implemented
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:01.760]   What people go through and the world of security like the ring video doorbell
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.120]   Sorry to suck up to a sponsor here. And that's not my intention, but it just works. It just works
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.760]   I've never had to use a nine volt battery to get it. I see people struggling with their lights
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.560]   They they they they tell echo. That's the real problem with home automation. Yeah
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:22.240]   It's uh, we all have kind of not good experiences. Well, just ask Stacy some there
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.640]   My baby. I asked her husband about the yeah, you were wondering what she's on. I o t
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:29.280]   the window blinds just asked
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:35.920]   Don't tell him I set up an automation. Oh, I should have checked. I didn't check when I went out there
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:39.040]   I set up one today. So it's gonna finally be working. I think
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.680]   He's gonna walk in the dark and it's go
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:48.800]   And the blinds go up and down and up and down and up and down because I I think at four o'clock today
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:51.920]   They were supposed to go down. So if that happened
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:53.600]   Ooh
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.880]   Now i'm gonna be out of the dog house, which I have been in for two years
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.360]   That's a lot of time in the dog house. Thank you
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.320]   Those are 16th wedding anniversary. So I had to do something special
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.760]   Oh happy anniversary
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.760]   Thank you. God hard to believe one so young could have been married so long
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.400]   I turned 40 in what?
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.600]   No, you do not
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:14.400]   I do
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:17.520]   The big four. Oh is when when's your birthday april? We know because it's the same day

[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:33.280]   That's a big one. You never want to sing happy birthday connected coffin course code
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.760]   When you get to my age you laugh at those death jokes at 40
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:43.040]   40 oh to be 40 oh to be so young
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.360]   Mike y'all again. You got a tip for us besides using google plus
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:51.120]   I'm gonna I'm going back to google plus just because of that. Yeah
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:54.320]   Check it out just because of that just try the moderation
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.880]   You'll be thrilled when you delete well, I know I've done that before but but do I I don't need circles anymore
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:04.080]   No, sir, no circles are over. Just just do I use Google. I use people still
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.120]   I use google plus as a blog. It's like yeah
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:10.960]   I know you do and I post things and then I engage with people in the conversation
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:13.600]   I've been looking for somewhere to put my I have pictures
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:19.040]   like control over the whole post right I can delete people I can I have I might do this
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:22.720]   thing. Yeah, you have total control over your own posts. Is there an app?
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.720]   They have apps. Yeah, yeah, there's no API right?
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:31.520]   There's no API. There's no third party anything. This actually is a problem, but it's also a
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.880]   That's how long it's been. I don't even is there an app for that. Do you remember how to spell it?
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:40.160]   plus
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.840]   Yeah, and and another good thing is it's integrated with google photos
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.440]   So it's you can just go get grab you I know you probably use google photos. I do
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.640]   else and you can just from from the app you can just bring in photos from the google photos. Why have I
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:56:00.720]   I tried to get everybody to use it. I can't forget it. No, but it's good. It's really good. Yeah, it's a
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.080]   lovely. It's a lot of the topos on there. They have a great bread. I follow you know
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:10.800]   I follow the art of bread community. It's a great community. Their craft beer one is a great one as well. I will I will start following it.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:13.840]   It's really good and you know there's not a lot what's interesting. There's some politics
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.720]   but it's not anywhere like it's not Facebook with politics. But again Bill Gates and his bike
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:24.080]   Okay, now how much would you pay? Is that Bill Gates? That's what it says.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:30.960]   Bill Gates, this is from vintage American images. Huh, I have never seen that. That is I've never seen this
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.640]   How many times have we seen photos of Bill Gates? But never thought I saw all of them. I saw him
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:39.600]   Allowinging seductively on the desk. I've seen all of those. That's burned into my mind.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:48.240]   Okay, what's your pick of the week? Pick of the week the Lenovo Mirage camera with Daydream. Okay, so this product was announced in January.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:56.320]   It's a 3D video camera from Lenovo that costs 300 bucks. You can now pre-order it comes out in May but you can pre-order it now on Amazon.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:02.320]   And what's cool about this is this is basically a Google device. So the content that you record
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:10.080]   goes or stream you do it through YouTube and Google Photos which are fully fully supported by this product. So you take 3D
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:20.400]   180 degree video and then you can you can view it with you know, you can your daydream with daydream. You can use it with the VR one idea.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:28.000]   YouTube, right? You can do the 3D. Pretty much anything that we. So it's a 360 degree but it only has it's not 360. It's 180 basis.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.400]   180. Yeah, so the two lenses give it depth. It gives it three. It makes it 3D. So they call it a VR. It's not VR. It's 3D video.
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:44.080]   And 180 degree 3D video. It has two 13 megapixel cameras in it basically. And you can live stream and they're fisheye.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:48.880]   And they're yeah, they're going to get a 180 degree field of view. You can also take three 3D pictures.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:57.280]   Works with the Mirage Solo which is coming out in May as well. Google Cardboard and all the usual suspects. But this is a very affordable, very portable.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.320]   You put goes in your pocket. What is a 3D picture?
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:09.840]   It's a 3D picture. If you view it through Google Cardboard or something, I wouldn't see anything because I don't have a 3D vision.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.200]   Oh, because you're old?
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:18.560]   Because he's got a glass eye, I think. Because you got the LASIK. It's one is the other.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:30.560]   You need a button that just like. She wants to do it with a yeah. So anyway, this is a fantastic Googaly product that what I love about it is.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.440]   Unlike there's a lot just because I can't see 3D doesn't mean I can't make 3D pictures for everyone else.
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:40.880]   Most of the 3D content. But you see the 3D if you're not wearing special glasses? No. What does it look like?
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:44.080]   No, look at scroll up to that image of the birthday because that was sad.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.960]   It looks like two screens side by side. Oh, yeah, I want this special something.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:55.040]   But what I love that really looks said mom for mom is not really.
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:01.120]   Mom's in Tokyo right now, but she's under she's working in the witness protection.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.160]   She and Edward Snowden are in Russia together. But have some watermelon, mom.
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:13.280]   Wow, that is really sad. You're right. Stacy, that's the saddest picture I have ever seen.
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.960]   But what is the price? Yeah, let's make a meme.
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:23.840]   Lord, I'm putting that on Google plus. Okay, how much is it? 300 bucks.
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.640]   That's a good deal. And if it's in your pocket, I'm not personally aware of any 3D video content
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:33.200]   creation tool that's that cheap or that small. Yeah. And so it's kind of refreshing. I know 360
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:37.520]   products, but this is as well. They're not though. That's cheap either. You can't get a good 360
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:42.000]   product at 300 bucks, can you? Not really. What is the Google gear? I mean, the Samsung gear,
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.600]   I think that that's about 300. But is it really? Yeah, but I'm just this is to me though, this is just
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:56.960]   a 2D image. It's two 2D images. Two 2D images. Yeah. With some distance information.
[01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:02.400]   So people with normal eyesight would look at it and it would look like there was watermelon.
[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:07.520]   Yeah, it looks it looks 3D and you go, oh, it's 3D. So if there's going to be 3D content,
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:10.960]   which there will be because we're all going to have augmented and virtual reality goggles
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:15.600]   and all kinds of things, these go on the market. In addition to computer generated
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:22.000]   3D content, we'll also have user generated video 3D content. And if you want to make that kind of
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:28.080]   content, this device is the probably one of the coolest and cheapest and easiest ways.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:34.720]   And you've ordered this? I have not ordered it yet. But is I'm going to wait till I see more 3D
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:41.200]   content on Google+, and then I might. So I found, oh, go ahead. Nope.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:46.000]   I was going to say I found a number in case we missed Jeff's number because we didn't actually
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:52.320]   talk about the story. And I think good. What's the number? Thank you. 5.5 gigabytes.
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:01:00.960]   What do I get? Your entire actually you get this. What's his name? Hold on. I'll find this name.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:08.160]   You get Dylan, Curran, Curran's entire Google history. So this guy,
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.280]   what does he know about it? I didn't want my own history.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:20.080]   What he did is he went to get all the data that Google knows about you, and he downloaded it,
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:25.520]   and it was 5.5 gigabytes of data. He also did the same for Facebook. He's not really offering it
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:30.720]   for free. He's showing you how to find out what Google knows about you. And this is actually a
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:37.040]   handy little story. If you're unfamiliar with this, I mean, I wander around. So this is Google+
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:43.280]   Facebook. It is just Google. Just Google. Wow. Just Google data. His Facebook data is only 600
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.160]   megabytes. Try getting that data, similar data from Amazon. Good luck with that.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:52.320]   Yeah. And Google does let you delete it as well. Yeah. Yep. Yes.
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:57.840]   But the cool thing is, it shows you all of your stuff. And the article is nice because it
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:02.640]   gives you links to everything that it's like, Oh, here, because I sometimes when I'm navigating
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.360]   various Google settings, I end up in, I don't even know where I end up. And I'm like, Oh, huh.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.560]   Now I'm doing my web search history. Now I'm doing my-- I have to say, Google does make this a lot
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:20.960]   easier than Facebook to get. Yeah. Take, takeout.google.com. And this is Brad Fitzpatrick's project. He was a
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:26.160]   big advocate from Dave, you know, very early on at Google that everything that you, that Google
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.880]   knows about you, that Google stores, you should be able to get and delete. So this is all of it.
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.320]   The highlights, if you go into your Google takeout, the highlight, the highlights are number one,
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:40.800]   your own voice that when you spoke to Google home, that is so weird that you can listen to your
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.920]   recordings. And the other one is your location history, which people are often stunned by the
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:49.680]   fact that Google knows every place you've ever been in the last like 10 years or whatever.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.520]   You can delete all that stuff. But it's fun to, you know, I like to do it because I travel a lot
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:56.720]   and I say, Oh, look, that's when we went to Morocco. You can see all this stuff and it correlates it
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:02.720]   with other events. And you know what you should do is all compare. Dylan's was 5.5 gigs. I'm betting
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.040]   mine's going to be bigger. I think mine's going to be bigger than that as well. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:12.560]   Yeah. Well, just just Gmail alone. I think I have, I don't know. I never delete anything. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:18.640]   Yeah. Yeah. I've got I'm more than I think I'm 60% of my 10 gigabytes of storage on.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:24.800]   Yeah. And this was interesting. I didn't realize this. It talks about Google has information you
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:29.120]   deleted. So he talks about his Google Drive and includes files he explicitly deleted,
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.160]   including his resume, budget, and his PGP private key. Oh, well, you should okay now.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.400]   If the guy's putting his private key on Google Drive, I got to have a little conversation with
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:44.080]   him because that was not a smart thing to do. Even if it's password protected, that's kind of not
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:52.320]   a good idea. That's why they call it private. But still, yeah, I deleted that you shouldn't have
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.760]   that Google. Somebody has a Kickstarter. I'm not a cryptocurrency person, but like if you have
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:02.240]   Bitcoin, you have a, what do they call it? When you have your key or your password or your username,
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:07.680]   whatever it's called as a set of numbers. Yeah. Yeah. So your account number. Okay. So, so this
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:13.040]   is a, it's a Kickstarter project where they will hammer that information into a, or you can hammer
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.560]   that. It's making a piece of metal. Then you bury it in the backyard, along with the various bodies
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:23.200]   and so on that's buried back there. And then if you forget it, then you can get a shovel and go find
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:28.400]   I know my number. My problem is I don't know my password. I know my number. You should chisel
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:33.200]   that into it as well. Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. And then take a picture of it and put it on
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.480]   Google Drive. Very that. I wonder if Google knows my, you know what? I bet you Google knows my password.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.320]   I bet it. I bet they do. Stacey Higginbotham. That's a service right there.

[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:13.360]   As I tweeted about the computers I used growing up and how I feel old now. And I got so many responses
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.280]   from people about their first computers that I was like, oh, that's always a good topic. What
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.320]   was your first computer? We built our first computer, but this was actually our computers.
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:30.160]   And I remember we used AMD chips, not Intel chips because my dad had a big beef. I don't
[02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:35.360]   remember why. But AMD wasn't around when I was born. Yeah, you didn't exist. No. But
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:39.520]   my first computer was in Atari 400. What was your first computer? Commodore 64.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:43.120]   Yep. Yeah. We're of that vintage plugged into a black and white TV.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:49.120]   In my day, you could build your own computer, but all you'd get was something we lost,
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:55.360]   which is on the front. Yeah. Thank you, Stacey. Thank you. Mike Elgin, it's always a pleasure to

[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:53.360]   on Twitch." And I mentioned those three because our Roku app is now officially deprecated.
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:59.440]   Roku changed the API. We did not update the app. We had paid Houdini 7 to do it initially. We
