[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Kevin Marks joins us.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.360]   Talk about the latest news from Google. He's back, baby. Rich Osterlo. I'm so excited.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.040]   He's heading hard where Google will talk about that. We also will talk about how the internet
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.920]   is changing politics in a big way. Is it good or is it bad? Well, we have a nice long philosophical
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:43.680]   discussion. I kind of think Twig's famous point next.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:57.360]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 351, recorded Wednesday, May 4th, 2016. Boiling Man.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.160]   This week in Google has brought to you by Headspace. Train your mind for a healthier,

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.280]   of guided meditation at headspace.com/twig. It's time for this week in Google to show where we cover
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   not really so much Google, but just a disclaimer right up front. That's just the name. We talk
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.320]   about anything that Jeff Jarvis and I want to talk about. Kevin Marks is here too and that means
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.760]   guaranteed a wide ranging, fascinating, intellectually stimulating discussion. Hi Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.960]   I will make any political statements today. I'll just wear my hat, show my pen,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.160]   show my buttons and say it's all hands on deck people. I'm trying to think, are you a lieutenant
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.680]   in the air? The Hillary army. Hillary army, I guess he is. I want a little lapel pen, right?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.760]   I thought a nice little subtle lapel pen. It wouldn't be too much. The thing is huge.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.680]   Do you like that logo? I guess it's a good logo. Yeah it is. It's an arrow. It's an H with an arrow.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.200]   I've been resisting calling her Hillary because I feel like that's demeaning because she's a woman
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.400]   when she just call her Clinton. Well, she needs more humanizing. No, maybe. Also with this Kevin
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.960]   Marks, are you registered to vote in the United States? Are you allowed? I am indeed.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.600]   Right. The first time in this. Oh, how exciting. Are you a citizen or a resident? What's your
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.800]   citizen now? Congratulations. Oh, can you recite the presidency of the United States in order,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.360]   beginning with George Washington? No, I forgot all that since I crossed the test. You did have to
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.200]   know that didn't you? No, no, it was actually easier. Is it easier? Yeah, right. Is it easier than that?
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.520]   It was easier than having to do that, but it was a bunch of sites like the obscure
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.320]   odd things. It's like becoming a ham. You don't have to learn Morse code anymore.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.280]   It's not quite as weird as the UK one. What do you have to do to be citizen in the UK?
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.360]   I'm only asking for academic promises for a friend. I'm asking for a friend.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.680]   I mean, it's similar to the American quiz, which is a both kind of sort of weird combination of
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.240]   history and shivolits and things. And the UK one involves like entitlement to benefits and
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.840]   odd, like government regulation. It's like civics. It's kind of it. It's stuff.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.800]   Though in both cases that actual citizens born in the country rarely know.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.360]   Right. That's the other that's the other amusement part of it. Yeah. But I think there should be a
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   higher standard if you want to be part of us. The new test is going to say, "K-Pasa,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.600]   and if you understand that, you can't get in." How do you all at long? So we weren't going to get
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   political. Sorry. We weren't going to get political. The biggest, but the longest part of the
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.640]   citizenship ceremony was being told how to vote in five different languages. Good.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.760]   You know what? There's two things you got, three things you got to do as a citizen.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.240]   You got to vote. You got to pay taxes and you have to serve on a jury. All the rest is up to you.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:12.320]   I think, I mean, it'd be nice if you contributed a little bit and stuff, but you don't have to.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.720]   That's the beauty. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of whatever the hell gets you off.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:28.640]   Meanwhile, unless it's changing your gender, but oh yeah. Meanwhile, let's move to Larry Page's
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.520]   Island. Google I/O is coming up. That's where Larry Page said we wish we were on an island.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.080]   He won't be saying anything this time. I'm sure. You're going to be, you're going to it, right, Jeff?
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.280]   I'm going to it. Yeah. On the timing is such that I think I have to do the show from down there,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.120]   because it's just they're always late. There's not enough time to get up. Yeah, we're
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.200]   investigating. Well, in this time, you're far away. You're in the you're not in view. You're all the
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.680]   way down in Google land. Yeah, but they got connectivity there. You should be able to do that.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.920]   Well, we're investigating. We're going to. Father Robert has a house down there.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   Well, he doesn't. The pope does, but you can use it. And so we're trying to figure out how we
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.160]   could do this. He's not just you, by the way, Jason Howell is going to be there. In fact,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.240]   he's staying the whole week. Well, here's the question. Google has all those conference rooms
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.440]   with the hangout conference thing. Yeah. I'll bet they would be happy to have us use one of those.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.000]   Well, and whoever's in Mountain View, we could just sit there like the two or the three of us
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.120]   with one camera. Yeah, honest. Hey, anybody's listening to Google and wants to host Jeff
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.640]   and Robert and Jason, Jason Howell, Robert Baliser and Jeff Jarvis, all three of whom are going to be
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.880]   at the keynote. We'll do our own coverage here, but I would love to go. But that's Wednesday morning,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.040]   and then we'll do Windows weekly. And then after we lose the wonderful Maggie Shields.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.680]   Ask Maggie, have you been following the great? It's just great drama over Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.840]   Craig Wright. It is amazing. Do you believe him? No, what's the? No, oh, not even close. So,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.320]   oh, it's kind of patently obvious that he all along has been using
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.320]   the Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto as part of a long con with the Australian tax authorities.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.920]   Yes. Oh. And so, okay, so the question is, you know, could he be Satoshi Nakamoto? Some say he has
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.480]   the knowledge. Others say, you know, the one, the only data point that makes it as all at least
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:35.200]   bit believable, setting aside the BBC's declaration that he is, the economist was a little mixed on it.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.560]   And of course, almost a year ago, Gizmodo and Wired Magazine both said, we think we know who
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.960]   Satoshi Nakamoto is. He's this Australian entrepreneur and technologist, a physics guy,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.080]   physics major named Craig Wright, Dr. Craig Wright. The only data point that made it be
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.600]   somewhat believable this week was a blog post by the former director of the Bitcoin Foundation.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.560]   Man, we've had on triangulation Gavin and Drason, who is, you know, as far as I know, as far as
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.360]   anybody knows, a man of integrity, who is one of the few people who's actually corresponded with
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.160]   Satoshi Nakamoto, not Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, that everyone knows all along. That has
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:24.320]   been a pseudonym for one or more people. We don't even know to the degree that is it more than one
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.520]   person. No one has ever known, and Drason, one of the few people who's ever corresponded with him.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.600]   And in 2011, when Satoshi Nakamoto, person or persons withdrew from the internet, just disappeared,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.920]   the reins were handed for Bitcoin to Gavin and Drason.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:48.720]   He boasted on his blog about three days ago, I believe Craig, Steven Wright, is the person who
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.680]   invented Bitcoin. I flew to London to meet Dr. Wright. Part of the time there was spent on
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.480]   careful cryptographic verification of messages signed with keys only Satoshi should possess,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.000]   etc. And that was what really set the world into a tizzy. Really Gavin believes it? Because
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.480]   Gavin, in fact, the response of the Bitcoin Foundation was to remove Gavin's commit keys
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.960]   for Bitcoin, thinking that he'd been hacked. They can't possibly be Gavin saying that.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.320]   If you've been following it on slash r slash Bitcoin on Reddit, you'll see all the back and
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:32.880]   forth over that. So... But the point here is that if he is Nakamoto, there's straightforward
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.280]   cryptography that he can do to prove it. What she refuses to do. She refused to do so therefore,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.000]   he's not. Right. That seems to me. That's it. Great post by Dan Kaminsky in which he says he
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.960]   talks to Gavin and Drason, emailed him saying, "What's going on here? There's clear unambiguous
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.000]   cryptographic evidence of fraud, and Gavin, you're lending credibility to the idea that a public
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.640]   key crypto, a couple key operation could or should or must remain private." And then this is Gavin's
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.960]   response. "Yeah, what the heck? I was surprised by the quote proof. Is anyone and don't yet know
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.080]   exactly what's going on? It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his." I assumed his
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   post would simply be a signed message. Anyone could easily verify it wasn't. It was a screen capture
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:23.520]   of a bogus bash script. It wasn't even real bash. It had a flaw in it. It wouldn't execute.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.800]   Had a single ampersand instead of a double ampersand. And he why publish it as a screenshot.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.320]   And it was probably a mistake to even start to play the fine the Satoshi game. I do feel grateful
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.720]   to Satoshi if I'm lending credibility the idea that a public key operation should remain private.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.000]   That's entirely accidental. Of course, he should just publish a signed message or equivalent move
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.360]   some Bitcoin through the key associated with an early block. Feel free to publish or quote this
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.960]   email. In other words, Gavin's backing down even though he hasn't yet backed out on his blog.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:02.000]   There's some talk that he was shown him purportedly doing that, but then didn't actually check the
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.120]   signature. It sounded like a magic trick. Yes. And I think that frankly what happened was that
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.920]   Gavin was conned. Yes. I think that we interviewed a wonderful book by the way, The Confidence Game,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.360]   the author, Maria Conoco writes for The New Yorker. She's really good. And it was a good book. It was
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.560]   about the grift, the con. And this fits it to a tee. This guy made money based on this supposition
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.040]   that he might be Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, money that the Australian government wants back.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.360]   And he's fled Australia. The proof was a lot of hand waving and nothing actual concrete.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:46.000]   And we don't know exactly what happened in private, but it probably was basically a magic trick
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.920]   designed to fool Gavin. I hope this is the next the new season of Mr. Robot. It's such a great story.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.760]   It really is. Well, that's that means. So the thing is security exploits and magic tricks are
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:05.840]   kind of a very similar kind of process. Tell a wrote about magic. Tell a repentant teller.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.400]   That the way the magic trick works is you do something that's an unreasonable amount of
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.000]   efforts. Nobody would expect you would have done it. And that's how you make a magic trick work.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.040]   And a lot of these security exploits are an equivalent kind of thing. You do some
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.440]   reasonable amount of effort to explore every possible pathway through the code to define one
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   that lets you in. And so that I can there's a it's cryptography. People should be less likely to be
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.640]   fooled by their stuff, but they can they can often retreat into the mathematics of it rather
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.240]   into the practicalities of it. Most of the time people get hacked. It isn't because the cryptography
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:47.680]   was at fault. It's because somebody gave them the key. And I love the post tweet from Wikileaks
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.080]   who which said the only thing this proves is what how poorly the fact checkers the BBC and
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.720]   the economists. All of everybody's been just, you know, actually most people did not fall for
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.000]   the good news is the economist was dubious or at least said it's not for sure.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Well, that's the thing is that no, the BBC got um Gavin into check it for them. So
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.400]   they trusted him. They said, okay, this guy took over Bitcoin from Nakamoto. He's
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.960]   you know, it's his way around this stuff. He should be able to check this for us and
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.000]   right. And he didn't you know, it didn't work properly.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.240]   Well, and that's as going to happen a lot because then especially with things like crypto and
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.200]   security, the knowledge required to do this is technically challenging, difficult.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.680]   Uh, and so you can't expect I don't think you expect general purpose reporters to get this right.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.480]   Right. But if you say there's there's a test here, you know, any Bitcoin client can sign with the
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.120]   key with your own key, right? It's it's in there in the it's in the menu somewhere.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.920]   It's a straightforward thing to do. Yep. And then you can check that as a cryptographic based
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:07.520]   proof that is rigorous. Yes. And so all he would have to, well, there's a couple ways he could do it.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.480]   He could just sign a message with that key or although that would maybe mean that he just
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.200]   compromised Satoshi's key moving a Bitcoin from the Toshi block. There's a, you know,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.640]   Nakamoto himself owns a significant amount of Bitcoin, which hasn't been moved or touched in years.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.600]   Moving a block from that would be a lot more. The fact that he hasn't done that.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.520]   Yes. Is a little suspicious. Well, that was, this is my, this is my crazy conspiracy theory.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.200]   And last night was that this is all a game to, to get people to encourage him to move money from
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:45.600]   that block because, you know, one of the, the panics about Bitcoin is that if, if, if that amount of
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.160]   money starts getting spent, then it would impact the value of Bitcoin.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.640]   Because it's, because it's too much of it. Right. You know,
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.000]   I wonder where Nakamoto is in all of this. In the past, he said, no, it's not me.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.800]   Well, no, no, not with a, not with a traceable account. Oh, really? Okay. So the news, when news
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.760]   week unveiled there, Satoshi Nakamoto a couple of years ago, there, somebody said that Nakamoto,
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.280]   there was a message from a known Nakamoto account that said, no, that's not me, but there wasn't
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.600]   provably Nakamoto. It wasn't, it was an email. It was, it was an email account.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.720]   But it wasn't signed with the key that's in the chat. That's the thing. That's the beauty.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.600]   By the way, boy, the center scores the value. Now that it's under assault by nations all over
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.920]   the world, right, putting our own in Brazil, that's the value of strong crypto.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.720]   Well, it's to a point, but the problem, you know, the other problem is, is that it's a credential
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:45.680]   thing. Most, you know, they, the head of the NSA said that actually we tend to win by, by stealing
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.520]   credentials rather than by breaking crypto. And just being able to sign something with
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:58.160]   Satoshi Nakamoto's key just means that you have the key. Right. You could have, you could have got
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.200]   it off his machine. You could have one would hope that somebody like Satoshi Nakamoto would secure
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.960]   his key. I secure my key. I mean, you'd have to break into my house to get it.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.040]   Well, but this was, this was, you know, I spent a chunk of time spending,
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.920]   and know my passphrase, which is a long, strong passphrase.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.560]   Sure. But, you know, I spent a chunk of time in the sort of trying to make sense to the
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   Bitcoin world a couple of years ago when it was ramping up. And the fascinating question for me
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.400]   was always going to the meetups and people were saying, this is going to take over currencies,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.760]   going to take over the universe. It's wonderful. It's provable blah, blah, blah, blah. And then
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.920]   I just do that for a bit. And then I say, how do you keep your Bitcoin safe? And they said,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.720]   Oh, I print them out on bits of paper and lock them in a safe.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.000]   Well, that's one way. And it's like, yes, you don't have to do that.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.640]   No, but the point is that because they are pure bearer tokens, and there's no repudiation,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.000]   you can get it stolen.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.240]   If you have a size amount of bitcoins, they're going to be stolen.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.560]   And there's other people who have them on little zip drives in saves as well.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.880]   So it's a it is a problem. And it's a structural problem with the way the system
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.680]   set up. You know, it's it's it's it's trying to solve a problem that we kind of don't have.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.240]   And it solves it in a very old way. A very expensive way.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.160]   I am somewhat pleased though that the tech press at least didn't get sucked in by this.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:27.200]   They did before with Wired and Gizmodo both. Maybe they maybe we all were chastened by that
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.800]   experience and no better. But it was the BBC and the Economist.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.720]   And I didn't see anybody in the tech press jump on this one.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.560]   So you know, the other thing that happened was so I followed it at the beginning and then I kind
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.880]   of got bored with it. And so obviously I didn't stay in track with it. And I don't know why I'm so
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:50.720]   fascinated by this. I like I like a good con. Right. It would make a good movie.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.800]   So the reason I bring that up is Nick Bilton writing in Vanity Fair blames
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:03.040]   the tech press for Theranos. And I'm not sure that's strictly true. As somebody else pointed out,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.680]   was in fact Vanity Fair itself, The New York Times, Team Magazine and with a Wall Street Journal that
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.120]   created the Theranos bubble, the tech press, I don't think really ever jumped on that Theranos
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.560]   trainer did they? Well, they did a bit. I mean, you know, they had a she's a charismatic founder.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.760]   She talked to all their conferences. There was a bit there was a chunk of that going on. So
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.120]   but it's not I was a lot of the Wall Street Journal and yeah, Vanity Fair and the Times and
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.320]   what was somebody else wrote a piece last week that was like, well, there wasn't really Silicon
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.800]   Valley because none of the big firms invested in them. It's like, yeah, really. Come on.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.200]   Is there anything to it? Is there is there is there a shred that that just didn't wasn't executed
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.400]   well or is there look more and more like? I don't know if Elizabeth Holmes is a fault or not. I
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.000]   don't think you can decide that yet, but it's starting to look more and more like they never
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.320]   had anything that worked. That's what I was going to say. Okay. Well, I think I suspect what they
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.640]   had was something that kind of worked and then when they went to test it in detail, they found
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.600]   problems with it. Yeah. And they couldn't well, and they hired somebody to get it to work.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:18.800]   And he he's since passed. He was he ended up being very frustrated and skeptical of the whole thing.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.960]   His wife has talked a little bit about it in the Wall Street Journal, the famous Wall Street
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:30.320]   Journal piece that that kind of turned it all around. They quoted his wife extensively and
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:37.280]   it's so it sounded like Elizabeth Holmes had an idea, but it was never an idea that was really
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.480]   viable. Well, yeah, it's the stop them from going ahead and raising money and getting.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.120]   Well, here's the other reason I think there's some culpability inside Theranos. They hired a
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:53.760]   board of directors not made up of medical experts, but of former generals and celebrities,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:00.240]   people completely incapable of judging the science. That was a bit fishy. But the thing is, I mean,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   the basic I've been I'm being cat invaded here. So, thank you, cats.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.240]   Put you down. The, you know, the idea that you can do blood tests on small amounts of blood is
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.200]   not completely crazy, but you actually have to prove that first before you before you could actually
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.760]   do it. And that does involve getting FDA approval, which is going to take a long time and do a
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.720]   budget of common stuff. You know, we do it for diabetes testing. That's an established thing
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.800]   for taking a single print there with your finger that sells in the in the millions.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.360]   So it's not it wasn't completely insane to say, well, if you can test for for diabetes,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.120]   for blood sugar with a single drop from your finger, maybe we could test for other things that
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.440]   they're doing a blood draw. But to do not to actually do that, you have to do a bunch of
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.040]   science and actually test it. And they raised enough money to do that work and they don't seem
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.320]   to have done it. So that's a bit that's dubious. It's like they did it, but they couldn't get it
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.200]   to work really is what happened. And in any event, they're under investigation now. And
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.640]   I hope we'll find out what's going on. But I felt like it was a little unfair of Nick,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.560]   who was one of us or was one of us to write in Vanity Fair saying the secret culprit in the
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.680]   Theranos mess was that the tech press, well, in fact, I think it was really much more the general
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.840]   press that was the secret culprit here. But it was a good story, right? And so I guess there's
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:27.040]   something to say about the press often falling for a good story as opposed to digging deeper.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.480]   But also not just the press. I mean, the investors too. This is this is my
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.080]   this is match is wonderful formulation, which is the the business model is invest a story time.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.520]   What you're what you're actually doing, rather than raising money by building a site with lots of
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.480]   users and selling advertising is that you're selling a very good story to a few small number
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.040]   investors who will give you a few million dollars per head. And it's that that is like the
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   the basis of lots of these companies that they can persuade some people to give them money and
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.840]   then it becomes a bandwagon. Nick writes the system here has been molded to effectively prevent
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.880]   reporters from asking tough questions. This is the same and and probably somewhat true,
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.000]   the same complaint about beltway journalism that if you're going to cover
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.760]   Washington DC, you better go to the national correspondence dinner and and make nice with your
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.800]   sources or they're just going to cut you off and you'll have nothing. He says,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.960]   the game of access and if you don't play it carefully, you may pay sorely. Then he quotes Jason
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.280]   Calicanis, who says, if you look at most tech publications, they have major conferences as
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.160]   their revenue. If you hit too hard, you lose keynotes, ticket buyers and support in the tech space.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.480]   I said, I said, fair, Jeff. I don't think that's fair. No.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:43.440]   No. Well, I don't have any conferences. So I would say that was a that was a that Cara Swisher
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.920]   is I think she's pretty honest. She's not. She's very honest and very tough. And people
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.840]   died to come to her conference and they pay a fortune for him. Right. And she's tough on stage
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.960]   there. No, that's that's Jason being Jason and going after everybody else's conference. But of
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.920]   course, his will be wonderful. That's a good point. He happens to have a conference as well. In fact,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:11.440]   that's his balance. Yeah. I'm not going to blame the tech press. I don't think that that's their
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.120]   fault. I'm not it's not that you know, I think if there's something there a flaw in the tech
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.400]   press is mostly that there's not much enterprise journalism being done. It's mostly rewrites and
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.680]   opinion. And by the way, of which I'm completely guilty, we don't do any enterprise journalism here.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.680]   That's I mean, that's the there's the pressure to write lots of short pieces and rewrite each
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.840]   other rather than actually come up with something new. Right. The better the better organizations will
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.600]   spend some time doing long-form things as well. But it's yeah, it's a challenge. It's expensive.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.400]   Takes you know, somebody has to work on a story for a long time months sometimes.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.800]   It's expensive to have someone rewrite everybody else's press releases and posts too. If you're
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.560]   employing three people full time to do that, then that's another problem, isn't it? Well, let's
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.600]   act that takes us now as long as we're in that space to Facebook's
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.120]   by the way, did your Facebook change dramatically today on Android? Mine did.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:11.280]   Facebook, they're interesting story. I looked at it today. Yeah, Facebook hiring journalists.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:19.920]   Okay, Jeff, break it down, man. Well, gee, they hired journalists. They should have treated
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.760]   just like princesses and princesses instead they put us in a room and has to a task that we
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.000]   didn't like doing. And so they're really mean. They don't like journalists. They don't really care
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.240]   about journalists because they were mean to me. Okay, so that's a whiny sounding story. And they
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.080]   weren't invited to beer bashes because they were contract employees. They were all sitting in one
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.160]   conference room. They were there to test one function and do one thing. And that was that.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.480]   But I thought the interesting thing was one guy said, I felt like we were inputs
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.920]   for an artifact. We were giving the inputs to an artificial intelligence machine
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.400]   that would eventually do this job without any input from us that that was like is no different
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.680]   from Google constantly using humans to quality test the search. Yes, they use humans to check on
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.800]   things. Right. And you could be on you could do it on on mechanical Turk, or you could do it in
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:13.040]   a conference room with Facebook. I have little empathy for this. It's it's it's this belief
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.640]   the journalists are entitled. And it's not an indication of a larger view of what Facebook thinks
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.440]   of journalism. It was a function that they hired people for. As an article by Michael Nunez and
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.960]   Gizmodo want to know what Facebook really thinks of journalists. Here's what happened
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.280]   when it hired some and he quotes a team that was brought in to curate the trending news
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.480]   section. I did find it amusing that part of their job was to replace the word Twitter with social
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:45.360]   media. Basically what they've done is hard to people to do what Tech meme does. That's what
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.800]   it sounds like. Yeah. Because Gabe gave started out doing this in an automatic way. Yeah. And then
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.320]   found that he had to hire people to rewrite the headlines to make the front page coherent. So then
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.840]   it's probably just as round up as it does that is probably just a coincidence that then I fired up
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:06.640]   Facebook on my Android device this morning. And all of a sudden at the bottom now I have a new
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.120]   thing. Oops. I mean, it says news feed. Well, I must be in an AB test or something. News feed world
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:21.920]   in US news with its own very own little banner. Whoa. Funny. Health and fitness politics, music,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.960]   TV and movies travel. And all I'm not clear where these yes. And then I can choose. Let me see if I
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.240]   can find the settings for this. Oh, there it is. I can choose which of these categories I want.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   And there's a lot of them. I took out home and garden and sports, which were in there originally.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:46.800]   Games, spiritual education. There's a selfies, celebrations, thoughts. This is some I don't know,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.720]   you know, it could very well be that I'm just a, you know, an AB tester for something we'll never
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:57.600]   do. But if you it says that paper is that like paper? This is Facebook's blue app for Android on
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:04.080]   my phone. And so what's interesting is, you know, these are I think these are you see there you are
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.360]   Jeff in the science and tech. These are all from people I follow. They've they're categorizing
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:17.520]   their posts for me. That's a big deal, Leo. That's what I thought. Now I still have the news feed.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:25.680]   But this is and each of them has its own headline, you know, home, you know, header. See world world
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.600]   in US news with a customize button that allows me to decide which stories within
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:41.360]   world in US news I want to explore. And then I have some selections here. I can search
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:48.960]   more posts from friends and others. That's important friends and others of that
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:55.840]   interest in your. So while it does look like these are my people I'm following. So far,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.040]   there's no reason to follow some news brands that are in there as well as like watching
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.160]   post. Well, that's what I'm wondering is how long before yes, see, okay.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:09.040]   I don't know who he enfalses and global nationals video. So that looks like, okay, yes, see, this is
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.560]   our tea. So you know what this there is. There is no, I don't. These are people I don't follow.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:21.520]   MSNBC, but these are being shared. These are being shared by other people. But these, this is all
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.280]   news from other that's an issue right there. So I mean, RT has real news kudos. Yeah, well, I didn't
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.160]   pick it. And so that it gets put in there. It's the same problem Google News has is that all
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.640]   well, if you're clear as well, news your news. Yeah. Okay. So that's a question. I don't know if
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:41.520]   it's just people I follow. It doesn't look like it is. Now I have to say I immediately went to
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.120]   funny and there was a lot of good funny stuff. So at least I can, I can, you know, get, go away
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:54.480]   from the politics in my feed and read the funny stuff. But yeah, so you don't see that in your
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.200]   Android. Well, hold on. I'm re I'm redoing it right now. I hadn't updated it. You don't see it either.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.400]   Okay. So maybe it's just a test. It says what's new improvements for liability in the speed. So I
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.560]   don't think my version will have a little same way. That's it always says that. Yeah. They don't
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.680]   write good race. They're very bad on the release. That's yeah. Yeah, I know I love slack. Let me see
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:23.440]   what my what my version number is here. I can tell you install it, install it, install it.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   It's just 4.0. What's new improvements for liability in speed? Well, 4.0 sounds like a major release.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.560]   Well, I might have been for all I it's Facebook so bad at this. It might have been 4.0 forever.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.440]   Let me see if I get a more granular number here somewhere if I can look at my settings or something.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:54.240]   That's content. I wish they would improve the UI. I mean, about 76.0.0.0.7.67.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.320]   That's the actual version of 4.0. Does anybody else get that in their Android feed?
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:07.920]   So this we've heard though for a while that Facebook wanted to move from the feed of your
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:15.680]   family and friends posts to news, right? They want to be a news journal. Haven't we
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.920]   have been hearing that, Jeff? Well, yes and no. I mean, they've got instant articles. They've
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.800]   done relationships with news companies, but they're not. I don't think they've ever said
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:32.160]   they're going to be this looks like flip primary. This is like flip board, right? It's categorized.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.080]   Well, also nuzzling or nuzzling. So nobody in the chat room has this. All right. So maybe this
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.880]   is just I'm just a big deal. I'm a beta test, but this would be interesting, wouldn't it?
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   Yeah. All right. You verified on Facebook right there. Yeah, that might be why.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.640]   Well, Jeff's verified. I'm trying to reinstall it again. Oh, you took it out.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:03.120]   No, no, no. I wasn't on auto update for Facebook. That's what Jason, like I'm not
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.480]   in fear. Jason Howl does is he doesn't. He's it's his opinion that Facebook kills his battery life.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.520]   So he uses a Facebook web. Oh, I don't think I am well there. You wouldn't get this.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:21.120]   Okay. Just thought I'd raise that issue. That's a news flash. I'd say. Yeah. I feel like Facebook
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.840]   is moving in that way. Well, the bottom line, and we were going to have this discussion all the
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.800]   time when it comes to YouTube. Facebook in my view needs to hire journalists to better understand
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.880]   journalism and better know what what its responsibilities and lack of responsibilities are and
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   limits are and opportunities are to translate to the world and all that. But Facebook should not
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:47.920]   get into the content business. Yeah. Well, you know, after after the primary last night,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:56.320]   we're a number of people wondering, would Facebook take a stand in the presidential election upcoming?
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.520]   I think there's I think everybody kind of agrees that they could use they would have some influence,
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.120]   don't you think? And then I think they might be calling some countries to regulate them. Yeah.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.560]   Google, for instance, is being criticized because they're going to pump some money into the
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.960]   Republican Convention in Cleveland. They're going to do live streaming for them. And
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.920]   they put several hundred million dollars into the conventions four years ago.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.280]   I'd say cover putting putting in money to cover the convention. No, what the networks do.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.960]   But putting it like that they profit from would be bad. Yeah. No, not like that. More like
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.440]   more like brought to you by. I mean, they've been they've been well, Google and Facebook and
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:42.640]   Twitter have been fighting over over association with with all the debates. Mm hmm. So they work
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.080]   with Fox News and the debate. Well, you know, one or the other. Well, their idea is that we
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.000]   that will cover both that will do the same for the Democrats as a Republican. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.440]   Google also, this is the this is the right answer. Google also put up $250,000 for the Flint
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.760]   water crisis. Okay. Research and stuff. And that's a political stance in a sense.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.320]   Google's going to be the official live stream provider of the Republican Convention.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.560]   Is that the same as NBC? No, that's different. You're the official.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:20.480]   The official live stream provider. But they're going to do that for the Democrats too.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.600]   I think these both Facebook and Google really have could influence the election. We know this.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.240]   And but but your is your opinion that there will be extremely cautious not to do.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.320]   They're going to be very careful. You don't think that Mark Zuckerberg will be tempted.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.560]   Oh, but but but I'm honestly not trying to get a political here. I'm trying to get a hypothetical.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:47.200]   You know, what if we came to a moment where it really, really got ugly that a certain presidential
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:55.440]   candidate got just beyond. I mean, Mark, Mark Zuckerberg is obviously a very liberal person.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.600]   No, I don't know that's true. No, so it is. I don't know. I don't know. You should assume that. I think
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.160]   that he has. Who do who do who do who do who do who do who do who do who do you define conservative
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.760]   liberal these days when Donald Trump is going to the left of Hillary Clinton. I know in some
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:14.560]   things on trade and the fence and crazy things. All the labels are off. I don't know where I am.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:21.520]   And it's wacky. But I think I think Mark is also very much a capitalist.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.680]   However, if you're going to say anything, one thing that Donald Trump has shown is that he has a
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.280]   mastery of the internet and social media and was able to use it to very much to his advantage, right?
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:38.640]   Yes. And I think, you know, so my theory that thinking these days, I'm thinking a lot these days
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.080]   about the idea that we're past the mass media business model and thus past the notion of mass.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.880]   Yes. And so what we see is tribes reforming. And those tribes are not made of soil or blood.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.880]   They're made in new ways and by new affiliations, new affinities. And those tribes can now find
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.120]   each other and go and do things like tear down the Egyptian government or tear down the GOP.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.920]   You have to read Andrew Sullivan's New York piece. Yeah. Because that's exactly what he's talking
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:15.520]   about. And it basically what new media has done, what social media has done, what the internet has
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:24.560]   done is make this a more democratic country. And he's normally you would hear me say that.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:30.880]   Yeah. But that's, but he says, he's quoting Plato's Republic saying, here's what here's
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.440]   Socrates says, tyranny is probably established out of no other regime than democracy.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:43.040]   That in fact, once you get to true democracy, then you are as ripe as you will ever be for tyranny.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.000]   Yeah. I think that's true because the problem is that our institutions make other presumptions
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.840]   than we have today. He says the elites protect us from this direct drive democracy.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.000]   And it is the overthrow of the elites, in this case, the Republican elites,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.600]   and the people speaking directly through the primary process.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:11.200]   And it couldn't have happened without the internet. It's why you see Bernie Sanders so strong, too.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:19.040]   Go ahead. So the other thing that's old here is that everyone suddenly saying it would be
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:25.280]   very strange if Facebook took an editorial line on politics. And yet somehow,
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:31.520]   newspapers and television stations are able to simultaneously make enormous amounts of money
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:37.760]   from selling political advertising in certain regions and also take both editorial and endorsement
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:43.680]   lines candidates as well. So it's there's a sort of presumed rule set that's there for traditional
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.840]   media where you can say, well, the New York Times will very carefully deliberate and eventually
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.280]   endorse Hillary and so on. And the economists will actually--
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.080]   And no one will care because they're just afraid.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:01.040]   I mean, just can't think about it a bit more. And Fox News will do whatever Fox News does.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.920]   But the point is simultaneously, they're also expecting to be making large amounts of their
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.480]   revenue from selling advertising. And the bizarre thing that Trump has done is he has
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.800]   danced along the line between that very world where he creates enough noise that they can treat it
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.960]   as something to report on and set advertising to other people. And he's not buying the advertising.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:29.440]   So he's kind of breaking the sort of presumed American consensus of the way this works is you're
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.280]   supposed to spend-- That's just--
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.520]   You're supposed to raise a billion dollars to spend it on TV ads.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.720]   One tiny area in which he's changed everything.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.760]   Right.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.600]   Sullivan writes, "If late stage political democracy has taken two centuries to
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.160]   write, then the media equivalent took about two decades, swiftly erasing almost any elite
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:52.240]   moderation or control of our democratic discourse." And so much of this was welcome.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.280]   You celebrated it? I did. The people have a voice.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.960]   Fusty old media institutions grown fat and lazy, deserved a-drubbing.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.880]   The early independent blogosphere corrected facts, exposed bias, earned scoops.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.280]   And as the media matured and as Facebook and Twitter took hold, everyone became a kind of
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.920]   blogger in a way. But go ahead.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.000]   I want you to read this, Jeff, because you're--
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.640]   I'm worried about--
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.800]   Because it's your idea I want to play with, though.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.680]   I apologize. I didn't read it. I should have.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.560]   Life's kind of out of focus right now. You get that sense of me?
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.160]   Are you little disoriented?
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.880]   Out of focus.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.440]   Yeah, blurry. It's blurry.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.240]   I don't understand.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.640]   But your books behind you are in perfect focus, by the way.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:40.160]   You see literature, it's always in focus.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.040]   What was I saying? Oh, well, so what the problem is, there are institutions--
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.240]   I talked about this before.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.640]   There's a great book called the Institutional Revolution,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.800]   that the institutions becomes obsolete.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.320]   And when you can measure things that you couldn't measure before,
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.120]   the institutions that you set up to get over those weaknesses.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.080]   So the institutions we set up with a two-party system.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.800]   And even though we're not a mass, the structure forced us into two masses.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.120]   Half of us are red and half of us are blue and we'll just figure it out.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.600]   And we'll do it in a civilized way and we'll be fine.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.480]   And you all have to be Republican, you all have to be Democrat at some point,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.080]   because that's the only way it's going to work.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.720]   Unlike parliamentary systems in other countries in the UK and Europe.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.960]   People are rapidly sitting upset with that system.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.920]   Well, exactly.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.680]   So it's not that we become more purely democratic.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   It's that a pent-up anger at the institutions that were there,
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.320]   our problem. The question is, is the constitution
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.400]   outmoded in this age?
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.920]   Or that's a much bigger question.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.960]   Interesting question.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.040]   Sullivan writes, "Trump intuitively grasped the vanishing authority of American
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.080]   political and media elites and he had long fashioned a public persona perfectly
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.120]   attuned to blast past them."
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:53.040]   I think very interesting article.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:59.280]   We have reaped what we have sown, I guess.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.520]   Or maybe this is just a little blip as we adjust to this notion of a true democracy
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.720]   and that everything will come back to normal.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.920]   What role does a constitution have, really?
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.680]   If the media elites have fallen and the political elites have fallen,
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.520]   can the constitution be far behind?
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.920]   Well, can the notion of the nation be far behind?
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.320]   Right.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.520]   That's what we're talking about really here.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.440]   Okay, so here's a scenario.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:38.400]   So let's say a president decides to ignore Congress and to ignore the Supreme Court.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.680]   The only thing to stop him is the military.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.760]   And let's say the military refuses to follow the orders of a president to order.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.200]   Then you have a military coup.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.360]   You may be.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.120]   Even if they just refuse to, not if they do something on their own,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.480]   don't they take over, but they just refuse what they believe is an unlawful loss.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.000]   Taking a order away, isn't it?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.960]   It's deciding what.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.080]   What we expected, Nuremberg.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.040]   It's what we expected.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:01.520]   Right.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.400]   The military to do.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.560]   It's really fast.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.400]   There's precedent in our own jurisprudence to say that that's what you should be required to do.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.640]   Who is the defender of the constitution?
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.080]   Because it has been interesting times.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.600]   You know, not doing your job to talk to a Supreme Court nominee.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.960]   There is an argument that says that's a constitutional crisis in and of itself.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.280]   Right.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.040]   Oh, we're going to piss off so many of your viewers, Leo.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.600]   No, well, no, I don't think this is a partisan conversation.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.400]   No, I think this is an observation about what is happening in America and something very
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.560]   dramatic seems to be happening.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.280]   It's key to what we talk about because it is about the challenges to these institutions.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.640]   And I think that's it.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:51.760]   I think, you know, that there was a good piece by David Graeber, who was made a resonant
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.280]   comparison for me, which was calling back to Britain in the '70s.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:01.040]   And in effect there, that was when there was a big sea change in politics,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:08.160]   where we went from the default sort of left liberal consensus to the default
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.680]   near liberal market consensus when that came to power.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.040]   And a big chunk of that was because the institutions broke down in the UK in the '70s.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.480]   And we had, you know, we had three day weeks because there were power cuts,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.640]   and we could only have power for three days a week.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   And the IMF came to bail out the UK.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.680]   And there was this sort of collapsing in social order in that sense that led to people say,
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.040]   "Well, we need something different than what we've been doing in politics."
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:40.880]   And the sort of free market libertarianism that Thatcher latched onto was that new thing.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:48.480]   And Graeber's argument is that the 2008 economic collapse and the fallout from that
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.400]   is a symbol, is that set of presumptions, the new liberal set of assumptions,
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.920]   collapsing. And we're now in a state where people are looking for something else.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.440]   And the question is, will we settle on something that's actually coherent?
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.720]   Or will we end up with something that is chaos?
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.800]   And that does time with what?
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.680]   What's his name? Solomon was saying there.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.160]   Ah, in other news.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:22.320]   Long way from tech there. But yeah. Well, it's not because what we're really seeing is the result
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.560]   of a lot of things, but in one respect of the internet era.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:33.920]   Yes. And a disintermediation and a destruction ultimately have a media elite.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.040]   Political elite.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.560]   Leads have a new crisis. Yeah. Government elite, yes.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:47.040]   And that's what part to a great degree, I would say, because of the internet.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.800]   And that we have new elites. And this is where it kind of gets back to the question I asked earlier.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.680]   We have new elites, Facebook and Google are the new elites.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.720]   Well, what do they do? They stand back and abrogate their responsibility. What is their responsibility?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.760]   So I'm trying to, and you just reading up on the Frankfurt School,
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:10.080]   because the argument that mass media was owned by the elites and is used to tamp down our brains
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:15.440]   and desires and just do that. So one could argue, some do argue, I think my friend Emily Bell argues,
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.480]   when we get, we'll finally get our show. The opiate of the people. All of that. Well, religion,
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.880]   but the same difference. Yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying. In the absence of religion,
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.240]   now we have mass media. So somewhat, or do we have honey, Facebook and Google are the replacements
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:36.640]   for that indeed, the mere name social media. I argue these days social media is a misnomer.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.360]   Right. We in media see the world God, like we think that if you do anything that approaches to
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.800]   what we do, then we call that media. But Facebook is not media. Google is not media.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.840]   Even though they do some of the functions that we did, even though they compete with us in cell
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.240]   ads, they are connection machines. They are not content. They don't aspire to be.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.880]   No, but they are. They are media. They're media and that they're mediating. They're
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:06.000]   not writing, but they are. No. I mean, newspapers were created to do the exactly the same thing to
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.280]   sell ads to do display. They're doing something different, Kevin. They are enabling far, far, far
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   more people to speak than we ever had possible in the media structure we have. That is true, of
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.240]   course. Yes. And so they're de their dis intermediating media. They're doing the opposite.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:27.280]   So that the elite that we had of a few publishers in towns is what they tore apart. And that's what
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.240]   we resent so much in media. So they're doing the opposite of that. That's what they live and thrive
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:38.560]   on is giving everyone this voice, including trolls, dorks and idiots on on Twitter and, you know,
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.480]   cat lovers on Facebook or whatever. We're not going to like it. It's not the elite anymore.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.280]   It's the evidence that it's not the elite. So I don't think that there are one for one swap.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   That's all I'm arguing there. Do they have power? Absolutely. Do we know yet how they're
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.920]   do they even know their own power? No, they don't yet. Do we know they're going to use it? No,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:04.160]   we don't. Do we trust them? Well, for now I do, but I'd be a lot more trust in in them if I think
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.240]   they were more self aware of their power. But I don't think they're media.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:16.880]   You don't think they have ambitions? I think they recognize the danger of of playing out.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.760]   If they did have ambitions, I think they what they recognize there would be dangerous to their
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:26.800]   business. Isn't this what Facebook is doing with this curated feed, disintermediating and
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:33.920]   taking a position of curation of editing of media of old media. But it's based
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.240]   there. The argument will be it's based on what you have shown you like.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.560]   Right. But the point is that there's a certain just ingeniveness to that, which is
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   that right. There was a thing in one of the NY mag the feed is dying. I'm not sure if you saw
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:57.200]   that one. I stuck the link in. But it's basically saying you're losing the
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:06.800]   sense that this timeline view that we had makes sense. But the problem is it doesn't work as you
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.080]   keep following people. It suddenly becomes too much. And I recognize this problem from years of feed
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.240]   reading and so on is that you start out with like there's not enough here, there's not enough
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.960]   here. I'll add some more. And then suddenly there's too much. And then you're like, ah,
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:24.400]   what do I look at? And so yes, they are saying we need to ultimately filter your feed for you because
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.040]   you've overloaded yourself by following to any people. But then they
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:36.160]   are logical rights. Casey Johnston does not scale well. Right. But the other bit that I that I liked
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:44.800]   was the, which of course I can't find now, but was that you know, you see, you eventually realize
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.440]   that there is not one web out there. There are lots of webs out there. And you only see this
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.680]   when you when you leak through to some other world, where unless you're part of the mainstream
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:03.840]   that uses Facebook an hour or more a day. That's the problem. Facebook is a total consolidation
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:10.480]   of what was flattened. Democrat Democratic media is suddenly come right back to where it was.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.320]   Is it Facebook the number one way most people get their news now? I think it is.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   Yes. So this is the passage that I thought said this to me was it says social media is
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.240]   a multi-first of interest pockets. And you'd never know they were coexisting until you noticed
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.320]   the tiny riff in the space time continuum. A widely shared Facebook first, a viral tweet,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.960]   a slideshow of 20 Instagramers must follow. And that opens. And suddenly you're in a world of
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.800]   Christian women Instagramming their book. That's what that's where it's showing minion memes,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.040]   teens, three, three fans of Jason Derulo. And that's it. That's what Jeff Jarvis has said all along.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.640]   There's no filter bubble because stuff leaks in. But well, it's not leaks in, but it also
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.720]   it leaks in this what you know, it leaks in in in in poorly designed ways because people
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.400]   haven't thought about that aspect of it very well. That's that's true. Yes, that's true. You're
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.480]   absolutely right. It's poorly designed. And we're just starting. But Kevin, the paradox there is
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.280]   everyone's going to complain that when it's well designed, it's manipulative. Right. Yes, of
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   course. And they already do. You know, there's there's there's this whole like, I'm being shadow
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.240]   banned on Twitter thing, which is, you know, basically the fundamental perception problem with
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.960]   power distributed media, which is that everyone has more followers than you. And the reason everyone
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.880]   has more followers than you is that the people have more followers are more visible. So everyone
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.000]   you see has more followers than you. And so people have more followers that becomes at some point,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.120]   people don't realize this at some point, it becomes a detriment. Right. It's more noise and it's more
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.560]   chance for abuse. Yes. Last week, I had people saying to me, Oh, if only I had my own imposter,
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:47.440]   I usually be honored. Yes. It comes from as Leo can well attest to much attention.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:56.400]   But it's like, it's also not misunderstanding that's it. The fundamental misunderstanding is
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.080]   how the power distribution of things work. And that's that happens at lots of levels because people
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:08.880]   might only poorly. So the basic thing is that this is the long tail argument. There are there
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.400]   are parallel distributions of things. So they're very popular things. And the second most popular
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.880]   thing is half as popular and the third is the third spoken and so on. And that that rough pattern
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:25.280]   of whatever X plays out across lots of media. Now, what what happened with the expansion of the web
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.960]   is that the range you could actually see of that went up a lot. So instead of just being able to
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:35.760]   see the top 200 people writing articles because they were the ones who were paid by the newspapers,
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.960]   you could see two million off the road. Yes. So it goes along a lot further. And this,
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.480]   I showed this in Technorati 10 years ago. Back in the day. Yes.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.680]   But this is this holds true for all these things. And as the number of people on board grows even
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:55.840]   further when Facebook gets up to the billions, this you this this same pattern holds. But the second
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.680]   order things start start taking effect and the waves that happen in between them start taking
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.560]   effect. But the one of the you know, the classic thing that they do is they do this, you're either
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.280]   famous or you're not. So Twitter has the verify people who are who are famous and are in the
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.600]   the top end of the curve. And then it has the rest of you who are supposed to consume and the bottom
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.480]   end of the curve and doesn't have a good mental model for how things can move between them. But
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.600]   actually the power or stuff applies at all the levels in between. So it doesn't just apply to
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.200]   an individual's fame. It applies to a person's fame as well. So somehow you may make a remark
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.320]   that that takes off and gets famous and bursts out as the guy says, bursts out across the barriers.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:39.760]   And then you are you have got the person who wrote that has gone through the transition
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.000]   from these two into these two domains and is now going to be attacked by everyone on earth for
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.720]   saying it's a great story. There was a great story this week about this.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:53.680]   Oh, I know 10 years later. Yeah. And how miserable he was. Now you had to move. Yes, it burst across
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.040]   and hurt him. I also I have to I have to confess after having Twitter hell last week,
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:05.440]   I longed for Facebook. I build a wall around me Donald.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:14.320]   You know, that they're much more civil, much more control in my hands. The wall garden,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.520]   the flowers are a lot nicer than the ones that the dogs pee on in Twitter.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.960]   Right. But you you had a squire hell, really, right? I mean, that was that that was the
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.920]   catalyst for it. But no, no. So the point the point the point is that yes, because Twitter
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.800]   is busy trying to curate the feed you see and is not spending the same amount of effort is
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.080]   curating the responses to posts and understanding how to model those. So they have I get there.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.560]   I hope so. I feel like I want to like. So here's the thing.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:50.560]   Yeah, two things. So one, I finally finally finally started using inbox. And now so I had an exchange
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.000]   with the Google executive this week. I just met somebody at a conference I was at yesterday,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.280]   and she emailed me and the inbox response was just the exact right response. But I felt a little
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:05.920]   creepy. She's going to know. I know it's right. Yes. And as we discussed on the show last week,
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.280]   you get to the point where it says, Oh, I already responded to or took care of that because I
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.200]   knew that's what you wanted. And I'm right all the time. So it's fine. So the same executive
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.800]   is using the woman in charge of Google Play said that Larry's view is that the web goes from a
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:24.080]   web of intent to assisting to suggesting and a friend of mine, Dave Morgan said, the next step
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:33.840]   is persuading. And so that if it doesn't have to do that doesn't have to auto respond or persuade.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.920]   I mean, you could keep going. Will it just because it can? No, no. So the point is
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.640]   saying once it's there. But this, you know, this is actually the sort of fundamental human
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.360]   condition problem is that we respond well to stories and we're talking about this earlier with
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:53.680]   about the responding world to the stories of the startups and so on. We respond well to stories
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:01.840]   and narratives. And so people get good at constructing them. And as we sort of spend time iterating
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:07.040]   over this with large ais and journalists in rooms, training ais and so on, we're going to train
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.080]   these machines to be very good at doing the Trump thing of saying the thing that makes the audience
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.480]   that he's standing in front of respond well. And you know, part of the reason that
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.000]   the networks for him and works against him at the same time is that he does that and then
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   you can compare it against audiences, but he doesn't care. You know, that was that was the thing that
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.080]   the politicians have always responded to the room and told one set of people one thing and one set
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:36.000]   another in previous selection cycles. This was a cause for shock and and gasping when we've gotten
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.800]   over that. Here's an email from Trey Radcliffe to me. I don't want anything just sending you love
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.520]   hugs tea, which is very sweet. That's Trey. He's a sweetheart. And look at Google's suggestions.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.000]   How are you? I miss you. And that's so sweet. I wish I could do all of them.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:00.960]   Because those are right on. Right. Damn. My fear. And now if I do that, I feel guilty because that
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:06.000]   was an automated response to a genuinely heartfelt unless his message was generated.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.840]   But it is. I mean, isn't that amazing that Google knew that that was appropriate response?
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.080]   One of the responses today was I was having a scheduling problem and it tried to, it said,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:28.480]   how about 10 30? I was at the right answer. I know it wasn't because I wanted another day.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:36.960]   But it's trying. And you know, if you look at X AI was Amy, you know, they're going to learn
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:44.400]   how to do that. And will we embrace our new? Will we say, yeah, go ahead and answer that email for me.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Well, I'll call one here that says, yes, we got home to website clubs night. And as someone
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:52.480]   saying, I'll see you at 6 30. And they also responses it see what 430 was.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.160]   Okay, it's not perfect. That's true.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:02.640]   Tom Zones always hard. Okay, I'll see you at 4 30. That's pretty funny.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.880]   Well, I can't take that one.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:13.760]   Well, you know, so my boss says to me, I literally said, okay, keep me posted. Thanks.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:20.080]   Google's responses. I will. Thank you. Will do you bet. What disturbs me is that every single one of
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:26.800]   those ends with what we call in the business a banger, an exclamation point. Now, is that because
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:30.640]   I use too many exclamation points or is that Google trying to be over enthusiastic?
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.680]   Hi, well, it's been, it's the training set. They trained it on clearly. And if they trained
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:39.360]   it on you, if they trained it on a large pool of questions, what do they do? I don't know.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.360]   Is that how I sound? I've used it to hold back on my responses. I guess you should.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.600]   Like I see it and I go, you know, I think I'm just going to go with.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:56.080]   Hempered responses better. So it can save you. Yes.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.880]   It's very interesting. All right. Here's some good news.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:05.840]   When Google bought Motorola, Rick Osterlo ran the place and I thought did a great job.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:12.560]   Responsible for Moto X. Did just a bang up job of making great hardware.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.280]   He was also responsible for Moto Blur, but he apologized to me for that.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.440]   And he said, we had to. In those days, Android wasn't ready for prime time.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.280]   We had to put our own skins on it. Good news. Rick left after Live in a
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.760]   Vowo acquired Motorola from Google. He stayed a little while, but he left Motorola.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:36.560]   He is now back at Google building hardware. He's going to have had a new hardware division.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.240]   And I can't think of a better person to do it. I mean, he just really got it. He did a great
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.680]   job with Motorola. And I will love to see what he does. Please, please, please let it include
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:54.160]   a continuation of the Chromebook Pixel. I think we're going to enter a golden age of hardware
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.440]   from Google. So he's going to be responsible for Nexus, which is, I think, widely agreed to be
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:05.120]   among the top Android phones and the reference platform. He's going to work on Chromecast.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:09.920]   Biggest success out of Google's hardware division is Chromecast and Chromecast Audio.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.800]   Consumer hardware, including the new Chromebook laptops and Pixel C device.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   On Hub. That could use some attention. Yes. On Hub hasn't really gone anywhere.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.560]   ATAP, which is the advanced technology group. That's the project, among other things,
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:32.480]   a project era, which was the modular phone and Google Glass. Man, I am so glad that they brought
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:38.080]   back Rick Osterlo. This is really, really nice stuff. No home stuff. No, no, that's still a,
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:43.760]   that's a separate company under alphabet. This is, you know, I believe, I really believe that
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:50.480]   the Chromebook is just about to just hockey sticks. What do you think of it? So there's the new age,
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:57.120]   we talked about the three beautiful, yeah, three beautiful new Chromebooks. HPs looks fabulous.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.720]   Three? I thought there were two. Well, Ace, Acer has the other. There's,
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.960]   they're both aluminum and Dell is doing now Chromebooks for business. All three are what we
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:11.680]   were begging for, which is kind of mid range, $500 ish, high end Chromebooks. Is the HP a touch
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.440]   screen? I couldn't. It is not. What's interesting is a few of these are touch screens. In fact,
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.040]   I don't think any of them. Well, no way, but the Ace, no, the Dell has a touch screen or can be
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.160]   equipped with a touch screen, but neither the Ace. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:31.520]   catch here as I always do. No LTE in any of them. I'll pay the monthly. I want it there. It just
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:38.240]   goes on wherever I am. It's a beautiful thing. In fact, put in Google Fi into it and I'm a really
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.720]   happy kid. When that being, well, only Google Fi. You saw that Rick is gonna oversee Chromebooks
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.760]   for Google and I would bet you that there will be a success or a pixel that will maybe be better.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:52.000]   We'll see. Now, do you think because you were pressured last week, Leo, when you said that
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:00.240]   you couldn't get any repairs on the old Chromebook? Yeah. And then they, they, the $999 Chromebook
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.800]   is no longer for sale. The more expensive one is, but I wonder if they're just, I wonder if they're
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.760]   out there. So I don't want if they're gonna announce something, I know that would be great.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:14.720]   And here's what I also expect at IO is an Android store on Chromebook on Chrome OS. Yeah.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:20.000]   And I think that's fascinating. I feel like they're, here we go. This is a, this is going to be a
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.640]   compelling argument because now you'll be able to, if you want a word processor, you can add a word
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:29.760]   processor. You want some better games, you can add some better games. The issue has always been in
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.880]   that case is that the UI of the Android apps doesn't work on a laptop and doesn't work without
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.960]   a laptop. It's a window. It's gonna be a, what a portrait window and it does need touch. You're right.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.520]   Although I guess a mouse could duplicate touch in every respect, right?
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.520]   Yeah. I mean, you can, you can run the emulator and click things, but it's still going to be a
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.800]   little hard. Yeah. I'm, it's hard to do pinch. It's not so much, you know, you can touch a
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.320]   push. Yeah. If you want to do pinch and those kinds of things, that's where it gets tricky.
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.400]   Well, I would guess that we'll see a, I mean, Google to put touch in the, in the pixel and I
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.440]   would guess we'll get to receive touch. Wait, I can't wait until they give us all a self-driving car
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:12.000]   to go home with. Well, I'm, I just feel like a Chromebook is, is, you know, Jeff, you were, you
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.760]   were a supporter early on. And I think I'm more than a supporter. I'm an addict. I hear 100%.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.840]   Yeah. Because I got all the press last week when you said that there was no more support for
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.880]   the old Chromebooks and that, uh, what if they've lost favor? And I can't go with a low end one.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.080]   I mean, I have to have a high end one and the HP looks very good. That gives me some comfort,
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.680]   but I love the pixel. It's a core look at three K display core M 16 gigs of RAM,
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.280]   USB C, which is going to be gangbusters. I think we're going to see a USB C universe and
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   other year or two and USB C to charge. Yeah. Yep. But USB C has so much more capability,
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:01:01.200]   including an HP is doing this, the ability to drive big monitors direct. Oh, uh huh. Oh, uh huh.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:09.280]   With two full HD displays if you want. Oh, and gigabit ethernet using an HP dock.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:16.080]   So, uh, starting with a four gig version, uh, started for 99. If you want to get the core M
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:23.120]   seven 16 gigs of RAM, a thousand 29 bucks. Oh, this is the mid high. Yeah, that's
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.800]   pixel range or mid to high now, but it's aluminum. It's by the way, pretty in the pixel. Pixel is
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.640]   kind of a clunker. This really looks like an ultra book. It is an ultra. In fact, it's basically
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.880]   a HP's ultra book with the promo. It's coming out later this month. Yeah. I wonder whether they're
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.840]   going to get best by a shelf space or not. Because the little, you go to Best Buy now,
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.280]   or I mondo huge Samsung display, but unbelievably huge Microsoft display.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.360]   And it's little tiny table with Google. You remember Chromebook is as now the number one
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:01.200]   seller in schools, 21% of all new computers last year in schools were Chromebooks. And, you know,
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.880]   you've often recommended it as a grandma machine. Yeah. On the radio show now, I just,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.400]   what I say, and I think this is really true, is, you know, 10 years ago, you had to buy windows
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:19.040]   or Mac a full, a full general PC with all that entailed the cost, the complexity, the security
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.480]   issues. But that's all you had. That was the choice. That was all you had to choose from.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.600]   And we still, there's a little inertia for these full service, full purpose operating systems
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.880]   that shouldn't be. Most people just surf the web and get email and a Chrome, Chrome OS is exactly
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.880]   right for the vast majority of PC users. They're over buying, they're buying much more complexity
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.920]   than they need. And as a result, I mean, I get calls all the time for people's, you know,
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.320]   my start menu has disappeared on Windows 10. What do I do? And it's like, you're screwed.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:56.720]   If they had a Chromebook, I'd say power wash. And you're done. Five minutes max.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.920]   Yeah. What? I hope adding Android doesn't add to the complexity and make it.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.280]   Well, I had a win experience a couple of weeks ago, which was the Android update came in for
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   my phone and break it. And that was it. That was a six. That was a six.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.600]   That was a six. Right. Yes. It happened to. Wow.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:23.920]   The six P six six. Oh, the next six. Oh, get rid of that thing. That's two years old.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.920]   Oh, come on. Pick up one of your spares. By the way, you should. I'll be glad to give you one.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.040]   That's by the way, another thing that's on a very unfortunate trend is people are starting,
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.720]   companies are starting to treat two years as the normal lifespan for a smartphone,
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.000]   which is so wrong. But for security reasons and hardware reasons,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.760]   they're not. I mean, it's just a big mistake.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.560]   So did you get in the dev for the new OS? The end or what?
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.640]   Yeah, what I had to do was, yeah, what I had to, the problem is it's now locked.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.200]   It was locked. So I couldn't reinstall it. I couldn't even reinstall that operating system.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.640]   But I could install the, um, the alpha of, of, of N. So I'm now running Android N on it, which is
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.480]   interesting. Actually, it's not bad. I like it. I'm running one of my six P in my
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.360]   pixel C. They made the notifications much less readable. I don't really don't like that.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.240]   Yeah, they balled them all up together, but I kind of like that balled up.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.200]   Oh, I like the notifications much better. They're more, they're more informative.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.000]   No, for well, but they're, the type is smaller and grayer and they've got my huge margins around.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.600]   Yeah, yeah. I know what you're saying. Age.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.120]   Yeah, I think that that's the kind of.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.560]   Age and typographical, fussy for sure. No, no, no, no, that's, that's the kind of thing you see in an early
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.040]   release. Yeah, no, I think that'll be fixed.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.280]   No, I mean, there's, you know, I've got a long ramp, which I should actually write up at some point
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.360]   about Google gradually making every bit of text on the system, grayer and ground.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:51.200]   So damn young engineers, cash, turn it. Oh, no, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.360]   designers in the, in the perfectly lit rooms with the, with the big screens and young eyes.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:03.200]   Yeah, you can see, but the, but the, you know, the latest thing is the phones now, like dim the
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.400]   screen as well. So the iPhone makes it the color of whatever lighting you're in.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.320]   And they, and they also, they, they turn it orange at night and so on.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.120]   So it's like, I hate that.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.000]   Let's look at the contrast down and now we're going to actually make it even more
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.920]   illegible just when your eyes are really tired.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.880]   They're trying to tell you, put the phone down and go to bed.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.000]   It's very on a hoppy didn't get in after you.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.040]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's, she's, she's, she's the queen of good sleep now. She's like the expert
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.840]   on social. She is. I wrote a piece about it.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.200]   Just weeks ago, which I said, please Ariana, we don't need another Oprah.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   We need the old political Ariana back. Bring her back now if more than ever,
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   if ever, no more than ever.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:51.280]   I saw, so I saw, he Leo, so I, I did a panel today at the wonderful DLD conference.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.440]   Oh, neat. And, uh, on the panel was Gabe from Casper.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.520]   Oh, nice. So I said as a matter of one of our sponsors,
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:06.480]   disclosure and gratitude. I said, right. The loyal sponsor, he said that the
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:14.160]   Twit users are the most engaged and passionate and loyal and they just, they're, they're amazing.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.760]   You know, it's so funny because we hear that for every single advertiser says that,
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:22.320]   but a lot of them don't want to say that because they're afraid we're going to like charge them
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:29.120]   more or so. I mean, those who will, who will say anything will always say that every single
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.840]   sponsor. I mean, that's, and that's why people come back year after year.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:37.600]   But so it doesn't surprise me. And that, and it's no credit to me. That's a credit to you,
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.720]   the people who listen to these shows. The Twit army is quite amazing. And yeah, you deserve a cut.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:48.480]   Your cut is, you get all this for free. That's the, that's the cut is that the sponsors pay for
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.000]   it so that we can, we can give it to you for free. He was so happy with the commercial you made.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.560]   Oh, nice. That's good. So, yeah, you know, putting on your pajamas, that is going the actual.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.480]   Not necessarily. I think putting on your pajamas is kind of taking it easy. That's
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:09.520]   that's more of a kind of a slack thing. That's more of a feed up and playboy thing.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:16.880]   You have their baby. Google has released a trip. I haven't seen it yet. I guess it's
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.960]   invaded. No, it's only for, I really want to see it. It's only, they're only testing one
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.640]   in the community. It should be so afraid. Trip it should be so afraid.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.720]   But I love the way on, I love the clustering of travel stuff on, on inbox. Yeah, that's a start.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.720]   You it was new to me. It's, it's great. This looks like a better trip it basically, right?
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:42.000]   And because Google owns ITA, it could really be a better trip. They have a lot of information
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.160]   already that they can tie into this. So look for Google trips. The APK mirror does have it,
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:58.240]   but I don't recommend installing stuff that way. You all about Android viewers, you can do that,
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.800]   but not us. Let's see. Did you read the founder's letter?
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:10.720]   Oh, you got it. Did you put it on there, Jason, from the APK crossload? Oh man, Jason's
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.800]   an early adopter. Jason's the band. Jason, not how a client this hard producer.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:23.040]   Yeah, I had this. Oh, it's pretty. It's pretty, pretty trip to Sonoma. And then you can download
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.960]   look. There's a switch to download San Francisco. I presume that's the map. So you have it on. Oh man.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:37.120]   Let's add a trip search destination new trip for my location. Nice. I'm tempted. I'm tempted to get
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:44.320]   this, but I'll wait. I'll be a good boy. I'll be a good boy. I wish I could sideload the new
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:52.960]   Facebook. Yeah, I guess I must be a soak test of some kind. So yeah, the thing is that that will
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.400]   be a percent turn on thing. That's part of the reason they're released, and it's so vague,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.200]   is because everyone's an experiment. Yeah, they're known to do that, right? Yeah.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.240]   But I'm surprised they don't identify everybody in media and cut them out of tests.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.480]   Keeping up with the Leo's phone should be hard. They don't know.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:22.880]   Leo Laundice's phone once a week. Yeah, no, it's a burner phone. They have no idea who this
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:28.320]   phone belongs to. Well, they might. I don't know how they would know. How would you know that?
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.120]   They know what your account they probably do. Do you have the new anybody have the new
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.560]   Google keyboard? Is that widely? Because I've been reading about that. I use I still use Swift
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.040]   key. I should probably use 50. So I wouldn't know if I got the new. Yeah, me too. I think he was in
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.840]   the same damn keyboard since so, you know, sixth grade, I can't now no, no, no, on the phone, man,
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.920]   on the phone. I know that. I know that. But I just, it's just I just I don't like keyboard
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:10:01.360]   changes. I mean, on the phone, man. All right, let's take a break. Dude, come back with more
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.200]   Google Chrome now the most popular web browser in the world.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.080]   Google plays now labeling which apps contain ads. Thank you. I'm gonna try get this Google
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.920]   keyboard while we're talking about headspace. You know, it's we live in a stressful world.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.960]   It was up late last night worrying, worrying, worrying, worrying. And that means I didn't get
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.800]   a great night's sleep. And that means I was a little cranky in the morning. And that means I
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:34.560]   probably snapped at least a little more than I should have. That's when I fired up headspace.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:43.280]   And calmed down. Look, our minds are the enemy within. They can weigh us down with fear, with
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.040]   anger, with stress, anxiety. The point where it's difficult to sleep, difficult to get through
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.400]   the day, but you do not have to live this way. Train your mind. There's an app you could put on
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:02.080]   the phone called headspace. And I love it from this great guy, Andy Puttycomb. Andy was a monk
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.120]   for 10 years. And you know, like a Buddhist monk. And so learned a meditation and all that.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.880]   And now his mission is to kind of in a very normal, non-mystical way, bring the benefits of
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.160]   meditation to everybody. His Ted talk about meditation has five and a half million views.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.920]   And he's the leader in the meditations on headspace. And I hear Andy's voice and I just immediately,
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:31.120]   you really conditioned because he's so cute and sweet. And he just says, I know it's time to relax
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.640]   a little bit and just be a little like a gym membership.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.720]   Yeah, see, he's just using proven meditation and mindfulness techniques.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.160]   Yeah. We'll show you how to train your mind. And it's not fussy. And he's not, you know,
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.960]   it's not a lot of, a lot of kind of, it's like a friend in your head.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.640]   Or visit the site in your browser and follow the simple instructions to get going.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.000]   The best place to start is with take time. I kind of crush on Andy. I'll be honest with you.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.840]   But he's made my life so much better. Now we all know meditation is an ancient, ancient tradition,
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.160]   but maybe you didn't know that there are literally thousands of scientific studies that show it
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.680]   really works. It will help you improve focus. It will help your relationship harmony. It will
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.800]   decrease anxiety and stress. My physician told me, he said, you don't want to get a heart attack.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:22.160]   Okay, you need to modify your diet, you need to exercise and you need to reduce stress.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:27.520]   You need to find some techniques to reduce stress in your life. You know that, Jeff,
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.680]   you had a very stressful week last week. So much so that I could have used this because I literally
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.800]   was getting, I was getting your computations, tribulation, yeah, we have computations. And I have
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:44.480]   to, so I'm not a big difference in my life. I have to, I have to make medical claims. But I got to
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:51.040]   say it's just breathing 10 minutes a day. First 10 sessions are free. If you meditate for several

[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:07.360]   So nice. So pleasing. I feel better just listening. That's why you sit in your garden,
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.280]   isn't it, Kevin? You just want to sit ahead and the birds and the cat and the boogles.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.880]   Well, somebody on Twitter asked, how come there are always oranges on that tree? And I think we're
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.080]   going to find out it's a fake tree. No, no, this is how oranges work. So most fruits,
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.000]   most fruits are only one of those. That is such a Kevin Mark statement. That's how oranges work.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.640]   It's like apples that are in season for like, you know, three weeks,
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:38.400]   soft fruit like peaches the last two days if you're lucky. Whereas citrus fruits,
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.520]   basically they just stay on the tree as long as you want to keep them there. They get thicker
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.160]   and thicker. I mean, if you're growing them commercially, then you harvest them at a certain
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.120]   point so they're all the same size and same rightness. But basically, they come in at the end of the
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.040]   year, they come in sort of December-ish and I just don't bother picking them and they just get bigger
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.160]   and bigger. And then the new ones come in the next time round. So the big orange ones are
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.840]   last year and then the little tiny green ones that are coming up next year.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.800]   But it means that the the pith gets thicker and they get a little bit sweeter and
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.600]   but they're good. The lemons are even better that way. The lemons that stay on the tree
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.880]   get get really delicious over time. So my mouth is watering.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:26.880]   So you may remember, I think we even reported on it, that Sandy Gould, who's the HR chief
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:35.440]   at Yahoo, decided to leave last month or actually in March, he wrote an email saying he was
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.600]   time to take a break and decide on this next adventure. So there's some debate over why he's back.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.680]   According to his tumbler, he had a dream. He had a dream.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:56.400]   Or she, I'm sorry, had a dream. No, he, I'm sorry. Sandy, it's ambiguous. He had a dream
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:03.280]   that he was talking to Mercer Meyer and discussing his new role while reviewing offers.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.080]   So Sandy says next morning, I call Brian and said, you're going to think I'm crazy. Now,
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.440]   that might have been his dream or could be the fact that Yahoo offered him many millions of dollars
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:19.520]   not to leave. And that was a dream. So was that it or he was going? Where do you think it was going?
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:24.720]   Well, no one says just, you know, according to Cara Swisher, who read the email, the internal
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:31.360]   email, of course, just time to take a break and decide my next adventure. Apparently, Melissa
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.120]   Marissa did come to him, not in a dream and make a multi million dollar offer to keep him. And
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:43.120]   well, actually, you know, you're maybe you're right, Jeff, because according to sources, this
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.760]   is business insider. Meyer made the counter after after finding out Gould was leaving to join a
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.720]   company she resents. I wonder who she resents.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.440]   Well, anyway, if you're going to if you're going to go to a company, Marissa Meyer resents is probably
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:10.400]   for a big offer. And Yahoo had a bigger offer instead. And now Sandy is staying as head of,
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:16.880]   I hate this title, head of culture, coaching and communication. I want them to spell it culture.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.000]   Culture. It's a culture head. Until Marissa leaves in about two weeks for
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.920]   with her $55 million severance package. Well, that's what I was thinking. It's like,
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.880]   he's suddenly going to have a really big job laying off all the people that are going to get laid off
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:35.600]   when the company is born, right? That's what he's job will be laying people off. That was that
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.160]   was the great joke about getting harlafina as vice president Ted is that when he had to lay off
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:46.000]   everybody, she has experience. Oh, I love Robert Baliser's tweet. Last night he tweeted Carly Fuhr
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.560]   and I was the first candidate to drop out of the election after the primary twice in one primary
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:04.400]   season. And we thought that the that the compact HP merger was bad. Very good. I didn't say it
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.960]   quite right. But Robert had a much much more crap. Well crafted the joke, but that was good.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.040]   Anyway, so it's a bit too much like watching Silicon Valley, which was
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.760]   Oh, I love that show. This week was basically PTSD for lots of friends of mine. They were like,
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.200]   I couldn't watch it anymore. Which part? The part where they bring in the new CEO.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.880]   It's getting a little real, isn't it? Everything everything changes. We got ourselves went to
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:31.440]   prize and yeah, you know what? I had the same making goes away. I've never been through that.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.200]   Well, I guess I've sort of been through that. I had the same reaction. I thought this isn't funny.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:44.400]   This is horrible. It's like, oh, oh, yeah. Oh, and Stephen Tobolowski, who is such a good actor and
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.520]   really does a good job is perfect. He is so good. What do you see? I didn't even watch the show.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.120]   Yeah, but did you see that PETA has complained about the horse scene?
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   Okay, so, okay. Why were they complaining? Those were happy horses.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:06.080]   Are they arguing there was forced rape? Okay, PETA. First of all, I don't I very much I'm almost
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   certain that that was a green screen. And that was a video they acquired. By the way, YouTube is
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.280]   full of those videos. There's a story about it. There is a story about it. Hold on. Yeah.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.760]   Isn't isn't YouTube hasn't YouTube become a resource for watching for one of a better phrase
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:32.880]   horse for an occasion? Because that's what it was. Okay. And it was very graphic. It was like a porn
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:40.480]   movie for horses. And Stephen Tobolowski is standing there watching. And then I should really should
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.440]   warn people. I mean, it is, you know, it's HBO. You know, you know, you know, you're gonna see
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:54.160]   something. But it was I wanted to cover my eyes. So, like Judge told the Hollywood reporter,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:59.520]   there was no CG. We captured that moment. What? That would they actually shot new footage?
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:06.880]   There's no way he's lying because how do you time that?
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.080]   They staged it. They staged it. So if you actually watch the scene, there's a little bit where they're
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.880]   standing in front of him. Then Richard says, this is too much. They cut away. Okay. And then they
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.720]   had the long conversation and they go back. So this is okay. But it felt like there were lines in
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:25.120]   front of it. Like I thought, how did they time that? Right. But that's that was that that's just
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.040]   because top of the list is very good. And they were probably able to get him today. If you ever
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:36.040]   need a guy to do a line, well, one horse is never my
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:41.600]   justice. So what were the next? Well, we had to do a lot of horse research. We kind of had our
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.760]   hopes dash at one point because someone was saying, Oh, no, it's all done artificially. They would
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:49.600]   never do that. But then we looked into it further and found out that most species of thorough
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.440]   breads will only in seven eight naturally. Wow. We just looked for a place where it was actually
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:00.880]   going to happen. Oh my God. Right. That is dedicated. That is an unusual man of dedication.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.680]   So you really had a vision, didn't he? The first place they went to, if they'd gotten there 15
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.480]   minutes later, they would have been arrested because it was it was raided as a hot farm. Oh, boy.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:18.720]   So maybe Peter has something as a as a merit. It says Hollywood Reporter, how long did it take
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:25.840]   to get the money shot? Oh, less than a minute. That's the only thing that's fake is, well,
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.680]   the horses actually go very quickly. Yeah. So we had to repeat the footage.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.040]   Some back. Thank you. Put it all together. The horse just finishes really fast. Yeah, no,
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   that okay. So so maybe it's not a green screen, but it's simulated. Okay. Well, no, they really
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:49.040]   did it. It's just they did it longer. It's just one shot loop. I love it. So then Peter.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.840]   Where is it here? Well,
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:22:03.680]   there are a lot of see it. I'm not going to watch. Peter calls it a ranged rape. Of course,
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.760]   this is what horse firms do. What do you mean a ranged rape? They're breeding animals.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.240]   Okay. And I can I can I could go there. May seems like the bears are tethered together during
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:21.680]   the process. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. I'm sorry. We shouldn't breed horses.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:30.960]   It's not like they were breeding to eat them. Right. Or wear them. Or wear them.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:36.400]   I'm not an animal lover. I like being high in the food chain.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.720]   YouTube is apparently about to launch YouTube unplugged,
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:49.680]   which will be a cord cutting service about maybe not about to launch Bloomberg says 2017.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:56.640]   This is the Holy Grail. Apple's been trying to do this for years, make deals with networks and
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:04.080]   content creators to do a cable cutting service. Apparently Google's been plotting this for
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:11.040]   several years as well. There's an hula out of them. Oh, hula is. Oh, hula is doing
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:16.080]   this to you. They've had a variant of this with fiber. Remember they've built this out in two
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.400]   free markets. But that's as a cable basically as a cable cut. Yes. But the point is that's where
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.080]   they've no previously they don't do the conversation and assume they could just plug it,
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.760]   you know, just just be the box that sits in front of it and everybody cut them all because they
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.160]   want to do deals. Yeah. So now they're going back and doing deals. Well, you know everybody in the
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:37.920]   and this is the Holy Grail for Amazon too. Apple and Amazon and everybody wants to do this dish.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:45.280]   Sony sling has kind of done this dishes as a sling is with dish with their sling TV services.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:50.400]   It's but it's kind of limited content. The real question is can you get
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:58.320]   the networks? You see promise the real problem NBC is home like Comcast. That's the problem in
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:04.560]   a nutshell. Comcast doesn't want to see this. They want you to use their service.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:10.800]   But it's you know the dominoes are going to fall CBS is all behind it. Les Moonves says this is
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.560]   great. Yeah, but they've I mean they've already got you know, they've already got lots of pieces
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.800]   in place. They've they've got YouTube bread for the music staff, which is which is bundled with
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:25.440]   Google Play music, which means that you get music videos without free but free, which is nice.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.280]   They've got already got the ability to pay for things on YouTube. You can buy movies and
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:38.800]   full length movies and things and some TV shows I think and that's sort of that's coupled in with
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:45.520]   the Google Play store on Android as well. Those do transfer I think. So right? You use them all
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:52.880]   that I do. Jeff. So they've they've already got big chunks of the contractual stuff in place.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:58.400]   The question is can they do a subscription version of you get you get certain stuff
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:04.800]   that competes directly with with with Netflix and Amazon. Which call it Amazon Prime?
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.680]   Yeah. Well, that's the other fight to me.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.000]   I think it's the old down the shows. Oh, you know, you won't be able to do that. That's that's
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.640]   going to be well maybe you could DVR them though. You need to be able to DVR them though. Yeah.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.120]   Yes. That's the point. I'm doing it with Amazon Prime. I'm doing it with Play. I'm paying money
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.880]   for it. Oh boy. That's. But at some point if I'm paying for a service. That scares them.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:31.760]   So Hulu is also announced this will be Hulu service in 2017. They have three networks,
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:37.200]   obviously they don't. Yeah. Remember Hulu was started by the network. So who's in a different
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.400]   position? But the networks fought like dogs over how Hulu should be here on. They they've
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.920]   learned to hate each other. Yes. And they spent it out again, didn't they?
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.240]   Yeah, I think so. I don't know who owns Hulu now. Oh, the other thing here that was quiet,
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.040]   I don't know if this is showing. Fox and Disney own Hulu and they are the ones that are apparently
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:03.280]   close to signing deals. So there. So Google Play music added podcasts. Did you see that?
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.520]   Yes. See it. I know it. We're in it. You're in it. Yeah. But it's weird because you don't
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.720]   subscribe to them. You just search for them. So it's a little bit odd. Yeah. I wish you could
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:16.400]   subscribe. Yeah. So they've they've sort of missed the point a little bit. So a lot of these a lot
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:22.080]   of these people say this kind of Spotify works to see podcasts as disposable entertainment like
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:28.000]   like music like you're listening. And oh, maybe today you'd like to listen to some spoken word.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.760]   So how about this? But there's no, you know, you'd have to search for it to go back and listening,
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:38.560]   you know, every week. So it's kind of a little bit. I mean, it's okay. I'm not unhappy about it.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.480]   We're very happy to be there. And if you search for twig or twit,
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.480]   if you're if you have Google Play music, you'll see all of our shows there. But you're right. There's
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:57.280]   no like magic way to subscribe. I guess. Let me let me pick a twig and see.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:04.320]   There's a subscribe button. Where is there? Mm hmm. There is why. Yeah. I didn't see
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.800]   on a Friday. I'll see twig. Where's twig? There is there is there is there is no
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.120]   Oh, yeah, there's a subscribe. So it's just like everything else. It shows the last 10 episodes.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.000]   Subscribe now. They're going to go read her if they could do that. They can do go
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.440]   I know it's an RSS feed dang it. And yeah, that's cool. Banniss is a long show.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:33.600]   I don't usually see these times. Holy cow. Lord, it's a long show. Two hours and 11 minutes
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.560]   last week. See, if I search for twig, we're like right down the bottom. Hang on, radio stations.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.640]   Well, that's the thing is you have to search. No, it's actually it's actually not showing up on the
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:51.520]   phone. Oh, well, they've they've been rolling it out in kind of inconsistently on an Android.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.040]   So maybe that's why I was confused. I would say if I search for twit, I find both cars and
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.840]   they say it's for twig. Yeah, you know what? I'm getting the same thing on the web.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.600]   Is podcast showing up on the left panel for you, Kevin?
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.800]   I'm doing on the phone. But if I search for two, if you if you see podcast, okay, so
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:12.160]   this is true on Android as well. If you go to the hamburger menu, go to podcasts and now search
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.760]   for twig. Ah, okay. Oh, there's the subscribe button. Okay. I'll take it back. And you know what?
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:26.400]   I'm still not getting it. Okay. This was this was something we actually were working on for
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.320]   months with them and we're NDA on. I think we were one of the first networks they approached to
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.320]   just try out, you know, see how it worked. What about you? And they don't complain to you about
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.160]   advertising or anything like that. Oh, no, no, no. So did you have to do a submit specially or is
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:44.640]   there a just very much like iTunes where you submit this RSS feed and they send you an email
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.880]   confirming and you click the link and then you're in. And that's that's public now. I should go
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.880]   and submit some of my words. But that's what that's exactly what iTunes does as well. Yeah.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:58.240]   They don't they don't they maybe they aggregate independently, but I don't think so. I think that
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.360]   they you have to submit. That's interesting. Yeah. So if I click subscribe, I get.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:08.880]   I get this. Subscribe to this week in Google. And this three checkboxes auto download the latest
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:16.960]   three notifications and playback order newest to oldest. Nice. Very good. And if you go to
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:24.400]   play.google.com and do podcasts, then this comes up. And this is where you can get started with
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:30.560]   sharing your podcast. Look at the number one. Oh, yeah. Well played. Yeah. Reach your
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:36.400]   audience. Nice. Okay, because because the analysis is a couple of weeks ago, I couldn't find it.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:43.600]   So I guess I hadn't rolled out yet. Yeah, exactly. It's not an instant rollout. Okay. What else?
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.640]   I will try that out.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:54.240]   Scanning through here. You know, let's see what else there is. What's app that was funny. 72
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:00.080]   hour blackout again. Yeah, but Facebook Facebook fight that Facebook doesn't like it. A Facebook
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:06.560]   executive went to jail in Brazil briefly. That's not not a fun place to be. I imagine for a day. Yeah,
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:12.880]   especially if you're an executive. Can I bring my briefcase and suit? No. Well, no, actually,
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.440]   actually in Facebook jail, they put you in a suit. All right. Suit is the new orange.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:27.920]   Um, Amazon first quarter sales up 28% to 29.1 billion revenues. All you should ever look at Amazon
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.320]   because they have a little knob in Jeff Bezos's office about that turns profit up and down.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:39.920]   Twitter is a stock wise yesterday at an all time low $13.99 a share.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:49.280]   Twitter shares have plunged 39% this year and they're down 66% from the IPO.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:56.640]   And yet it's still one of the most important institutions of the new millennium.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:04.400]   What would you do with Twitter as a business? I don't know. It's a Twitter in Yahoo. What would
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:09.120]   you do? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yahoo is going to be sold to Verizon or somebody, right? That's the
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.320]   thing. Yeah. Yeah. What would you do with Twitter as a business? So Yahoo's done.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.640]   Twitter, I feel like there's so much. Why do they need to do anything?
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:23.120]   Stock prices, the only thing that matters, right? Because they're making money, right?
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:28.320]   They're not running out of money or anything. Yeah. I saw this at a panel. I saw somebody in
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.440]   a panel say, yeah, this is so only can making $2 billion be considered failure instead of
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.000]   so in the market. Only did the stock market. Only did the stock market. Yeah. So you say,
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.560]   that's pretty good compared to any media company.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:47.440]   Roe v. buys Tivo. $1.1 billion. I didn't realize the Tivo had,
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:53.520]   Tom Rogers was a very smart CEO who brought it out of nothing and made it into real company
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.160]   and real products. But I didn't realize it was starting to fade a bit, I guess,
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.760]   because there's enough competitive technology elsewhere. Yeah. You know, it's still the best
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:06.160]   technology, but it's very pricey. You can rent the cable company DVR as bad as it is for a few
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.720]   bucks a month. You got to buy a Tivo and then you have to pay a monthly fee for the subscription.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:17.360]   I wonder if it held out a little longer, you know, if the FCC does win at deregulating
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.920]   cable boxes and letting us all pick our own cable boxes, then being able to pick the Tivo
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.360]   without having to do the service. Oh, and that's another hurdle. You have to go to your cable
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:34.000]   company and pry a cable card out of them. Oh, yeah, which is, yeah. So yeah, I'm not surprised Tivo
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.080]   is not doesn't have huge market share. It's a shame because it really is the best.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.920]   Did either of you go to what is it further forward or for a few other future?
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:52.480]   Further. Oh, yeah. So that's all I remember the 1%. So burning man was just getting just
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:58.480]   jammed to the Huype Loy. So the top 1% of the burners started their own.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:03.360]   They're both so obnoxious. They're like, like, Ted on dust.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:07.760]   And here's Eric Schmidt in his apparently homemade mirrored vest, although he didn't.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.160]   But you got to see the top hat too. There's a little bit of a picture of the top.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:14.560]   He didn't effort enough to actually replace the gray cardigan and white shirt. He was wearing
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:19.440]   beneath. So maybe we could help him a black turtleneck. Maybe Eric something just a little
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.440]   hipper. The old little. I don't know if you can find it easily. There's a picture of Loye
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:27.680]   with Eric, both with their headdresses on. Yeah, there's there's that.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:33.520]   There's the top hat. And when asked, what did you, you know, what do they ask him? Did you,
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:37.600]   where did you get that? Did somebody give that to you? He said, no, no, it's mine.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.960]   As if he made the mirror vest and top hat, I doubt it.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:47.680]   Yeah. Okay. I don't know. It's fun. The mocks. I can see him with a glue gun. Yeah.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.120]   Yeah. It's fun. The mock.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.160]   And that's the whole point. It's awkward. It is mockery. Yes. Yeah. Oh, it is.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.800]   What they have their own. There's low. There's a lot of.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.840]   I love low. But I think he's going through a midlife crisis.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:08.560]   Having been there, I recognize the signs.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:15.360]   Daily video show now. Is he? No. Yes. He's got a new conference called leaders.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.920]   L-e-a-d-e dot r s or something like that. Yeah, which is kind of interesting because he's trying
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:25.120]   to get folks to have a little more control over the world, which I like. Yeah. And it's going to be,
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.840]   because he sold L-e-b, which was a great conference. I went several years ago. I love L-e-e-e.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:37.600]   He's a good friend. And he's got leaders is going to be in France again. I mean, he's going to be
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:44.000]   like the new L-e-b, I guess. I say this with love and respect and affection, but he is the master of
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.440]   the humble break. Oh, yes. Here I am on the top of the mountain in my hang glider.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.160]   Oh, no. It's just as a normal day. It's just hilarious. One must follow the
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.640]   weekend Instagram and Facebook to really enjoy. It's amazing. I love the glasses.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.600]   He's got sunglasses with a third lens for the third eye because one doesn't want to get one's
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:11.520]   third eye blinded by the light. See, L-e-e-e didn't wear a gray cardigan. I'm like, sure, I don't need this.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.200]   I don't think L-e-e-e-e owns a gray cardigan. Perfect.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.120]   It's very, very best of minutes. Where? That's outside of Las Vegas. It's just, it's like a
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:27.200]   little burning man. It seems like. But with trailers and concierge, whatever wish you have.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.040]   What's, what is actually, they're, they're, they're, they brag. They're all kinds of business
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:34.960]   deals going to be done here. So it's, it's Allen and company on does. Oh, it's the Bohemian Grove for
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:43.360]   the new century. But what's the actual, is the, is the, the fig leaf of attraction is music?
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.360]   Yeah. I mean, can I just be honest? I think, I think I've not been to Burning Man, but it's my strong
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:59.520]   impression that Burning Man is mostly about drugs and sex and art cars. And music.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:06.240]   Is there music at Burning Man? Is there a ribbon of you, Ben? There's tents. I haven't been there.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:12.640]   I don't know. I don't think it's a music festival. It's an art festival. Yeah. In the middle of the
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.760]   most God for a sake. But part of it is like dance music and yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah. There's dancing and
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.600]   and some life and sex. And then there's some drugs and then there's some more dancing and
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.640]   some more sex. And then there's some art and there's some more sex and some dancing and some drugs.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:33.600]   I was, I used to go to Burning Man when it was just a little bonfire out at Ocean Beach. I don't
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:42.000]   know what these young people are up to. I don't know what this is. Ray publica had a mobile sauna.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.080]   Did you post this? This is a conference I went to in Berlin. It's a blarg conference that I love.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:53.200]   And I did the sauna jokes there. In fact, then challenged people to meet me in the sauna next door
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:37:00.080]   and some did. And so there was in a hotel next door. So this year they had a portable sauna at the
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.760]   Ray publica conference making me really mad that I'm not there. I just really affordable sauna.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Mobile sauna. That seemed like a good idea. So if you look at my Twitter feed,
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.920]   a couple guys sent me a picture of themselves. I think they were the guys I was in this honor with
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.280]   five years ago from inside the sauna. I don't want to get this on with a bunch of bloggers.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:26.560]   We're already sweaty. Yeah. Yeah. I'm posting right now.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.760]   So I just thought that was, you know, imagine that it's out by Southwest.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.600]   We're having, we're starting our own kind of little event here in Sonoma. I'd like to invite
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.040]   you all to it's for the bottom 1%. It's called Burning Ham.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.960]   And it'll be it's coming up in October. Oh, no, this is old. Okay.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:55.920]   It's a celebration of delicious pork, but it does have lago and his beer. So that's, you know,
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.960]   that's good. Whole pigs being roasted. Take that, Peter.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:04.080]   Okay. This was like that in San Jose last year. That was burning ham.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.320]   Oh, what? What? What? It was cool. It was like bacon fest or something.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.920]   Basically it was like food trucks full of bacon and beer downtown. It's like,
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:22.240]   it sounds good. Yeah. All right. I think it's time to wrap this up. As fun as this is.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:27.680]   I think looking at the length of the show scared you. It did. I think I don't want to do three hours
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.920]   shows. We're headed that way. No, you know, the, you know, the real problem is,
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:39.760]   I for A, I don't want to edit. And B, I really like talking to you guys and it's really fun.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.360]   And I just feel like these shows aren't really shows. They're just a chance for me to get together
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.720]   and talk to people I like. And I coerce them into being here for a while. And so why would I cut it short?
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.280]   It's too much fun. And you know, nobody ever really says, could you make shorter podcasts?
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.440]   They just turned them off. Yeah.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.960]   There you go. Okay. That's enough. I'm done.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.360]   Well, it was fun. It was so funny when we brought in the wonderful Andy Berman, the producer of
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.240]   not NYC, which I haven't plugged yet, our brand new podcast we're working on in beta for New York
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.840]   out of CUNY, she said, she said, what, you're gonna do like, we'll do like 20 minute shows, right?
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:22.960]   That's not too interesting. Come on. No, really. I said, no, no, no. And so then she got it. We
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.240]   got into it. So the first show we did, which is still not up yet, we got to put up with Emily
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:33.200]   Bell, the good video version, was about an hour. And she said, she said, it didn't feel too long.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.640]   It should be as long as it needs to be is the exact way. Yeah. What it is. Last week, you know,
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:44.000]   it's I'm learning, you know, I'm only done too so far, but it's amazing being you Leo. And I don't
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.280]   I don't I don't intend to be you. But to deal with the pressures and the difficulties that you
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.000]   deal with, I'm trying to think of the timing and this and that. And you know, it's it's it's it's
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.120]   the second nature to you, but it's nerve wracking. It's hard work. It is.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.560]   I really. You're so tired.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:06.800]   That's he just we're just talking. We're just having fun. Yeah. We're talking with friends,
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.360]   bad stuff, important stuff. There's burning, man.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:14.640]   Out in the desert. So the the the the
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:21.040]   ethos of brain man is what you're not allowed to bring. What? This is whole shtick, right?
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:24.640]   About you can't bring some stuff and you've got to live off the land. It's kind of supposed to be
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.680]   taking away again afterwards is the point. Yeah, you got it's yeah. Nothing goes in that doesn't
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.200]   come out and you're not supposed to bring money. There's not supposed to be money exchange for
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.080]   anything. Trash in trash out, but you but you get but people often bring gifts, little gifts,
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.800]   like chapstick, like they might have a hundred chapstick in a and they hand them and so people
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.520]   give gifts to each other and it's supposed to be it's kind of hippie-ish, but really it's about
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:53.040]   art. It's an art festival. It's not a music festival. It's an art festival. So people all year long
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.960]   and a lot of we have a lot of burners in Petaluma all year long they'll build sculptures and
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:06.240]   create things which they'll then bring out and you know it's it's uh I've never gone because
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:12.320]   it mostly because I don't want to get any alkali up my butt. It's very it's in the middle of a very
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.320]   dry desert. They have sandstorm. Yeah, there you go. There you go. Right there. Sandstorms and
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.040]   this is an unusually clear day. In fact, this year's Burning Man. Last last Labor Day was really
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:29.440]   I'm quite messy. It's a dry lake. It's a full alkaline. I don't know. We should go. We should
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.680]   go. We should do a show from there. We'd have to sit there naked. There's the there's the famous
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.520]   sculpture. They burn these at the end. That's what's called Burning Man. But I've been to the
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:44.640]   Bohemian Grove where they do the same thing. They burn. They have the they they have a ceremony at
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.960]   the beginning the end the end of cares and they burn something at the end and it's very so much
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.040]   like the Bohemian Grove. I don't I think Leo you ought to do you ought to figure out your own
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:59.920]   festival to do for the Twit Army. It'd be fun. Yeah. Yeah. Well, well, well, what would that entail?
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.840]   No, but then I'd be beholden to them and I'd be part then I'd have to wouldn't be able to cover
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.440]   things freely because I'd have to keep my conference going and I want to do a little version
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:16.800]   of Burning Man that I call hot tub tech machine. And it's me and our guests in a hot tub.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:25.440]   That's all TMI follows. No, we could wear a bathing suit. That's even not necessarily the
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.840]   most pleasant thing but going up. I think the hot tub speeds up the show a little bit.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:38.640]   All raisins. Yes. Anybody got a pick or a number or anything? You want to plug the
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.080]   indie web camper? Why don't you watch you do that first Kevin and then
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.560]   is it? It's indie webcam doosled off this weekend. We had one in
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.760]   Urumberg a couple of weeks ago. So Germany's doing well this year. They love the indie web cam.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.320]   And then there is the big indie web summit in Portland coming up next month.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:05.120]   I'm sure I need to put the link for somebody said I should call my hot tub a show boiling man.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.800]   Thank you, Wumbermill. indiewebcamp.com. I-N-D-I-E for all the information here.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.600]   And this is about what keeping the web independent. Yes.
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:26.640]   So there's it's a combination of events. There's an ongoing chat room, a wiki full of
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:32.240]   staff and tech specs and so on. So Homebrew website club is every two weeks in a bunch of
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.920]   cities. There's one tonight in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland, though you've missed
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:43.200]   the ones that have happened already in Brighton and Yerta Bergen-Sweden. And then screwing
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:48.720]   out a bit further, there's indie web camp, which is the two-day weekend long thing, which is an
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:55.120]   unconference. It's basically one day of conversation and one day of hacking and with demos for a
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.880]   big, big end. And there's one coming up in Dusseldorf this weekend. And then there's the indie web
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:08.480]   summit in Portland in just under a month, June the 4th. Now I see that Bruce Sterling wrote about
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:15.840]   your principles way back when in 2013. Is he is he a indie webcam supporter? I think people
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:20.800]   connect to the ideas. I'm not sure if he's he's used it directly. But a lot of independent
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.840]   creators like the idea of owning their own site is part of the value of what we're trying to do.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.720]   And then the other two things that spin out of that are standards that we've been working on,
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.560]   working their way through the W3C at the moment. And those are web mention and micro-pub. So
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:42.560]   micro-pub is the abstraction for letting you post to your site from elsewhere.
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:49.280]   And that is currently a working draft at W3C is actually published today, I think.
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.480]   And we're trying to get that. The basic premise is straightforward. You
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.840]   authenticate and then you write your post and then it posts your site. But you can do that
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:06.480]   from anywhere. So that lets us build tools that let us have comments in between sites or responses
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.520]   or other tools that will read your post from somewhere else and bring the back in. So there's
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:16.320]   one tool that will, if you post something on Instagram, it'll then create a post on your own
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.120]   site for it. So it's a building block we use to let you post to your own site from elsewhere.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:28.240]   And then we have also got abstracted variations of that that wrap existing sites and silos. So
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.160]   there's a thing called silo-pub that lets you use micro-pub with Facebook and Tumblr and
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:39.200]   Blogger and so on. So that's micro-pub that lets you use this very simple generic posting API
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:46.160]   but a bunch of insights. And then web mention is the other standard that's going through to
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.600]   if you see at the moment. And this is for, I've said something about you on my site. And so in that
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:58.720]   case, if you have web mention set up, I send your endpoint this post on my site, linked to this
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.360]   post on your site. And then you can interpret that to understand whether I was doing a reply
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:10.560]   or a like or an RSVP or whatever. And so that's the, again, that spec is going through to the
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:18.000]   PC at the moment. And it's a good time to look at them because we've got reasonable implementations
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.920]   of both of them. But if there's, as we're trying to get this W3C group shut down by September,
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:28.480]   this is a good time to have a look at the state of these standards and see if we can
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:33.280]   get them finished. So if you work on any of this stuff, do look at these, see if you can plug them
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:38.400]   into the systems you're building. Because we've already got, we've been building this stuff for
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.920]   probably nearly five years now. And it's mostly been building small protocols that intro broke
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.840]   between our own sites. But we think we've got them in a state now and we've got enough implementations
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.720]   that they make sense to deliver standards. What blog software do you use Kevin? You use
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.160]   known or with known? I use a mixture of different things. I use known, I use a static site of my
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:03.040]   own at Kevin Marks.com that I just post HTML to by hand. I have a word.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.840]   But does it support all the micro pub stuff? It doesn't support micro pub, but it supports
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:15.760]   web mention. I use a service that lets you use web mention with a static site. It basically has
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.280]   a web mention endpoint, which can be off-site. And then I have JavaScript that injects the
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.600]   responses in my site. So if you go to Kevin Marks.com and scroll down to the bottom, you'll see a
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.680]   bunch of replies and things that have been brought back into my site from that. But I don't have
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.560]   micro pub working for that yet. So that would be something I should probably build. But part of
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.920]   it is that the posts I put on my own site, I'm often talking about HTML and things. So they tend
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:47.040]   to be a little bit handmade. Whereas the stuff that I share on other sites don't do that so much.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:54.960]   The SVG sparklines one, for example. That one is the talking about how to construct stuff at
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.880]   SVG. So it has a bunch of code in it and then embedded SVG and things like that. And this stuff
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.200]   doesn't always translate well to trying to post on Facebook or Medium or something like that.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:12.240]   I use with number. I wonder if Ben and Aaron are's. How hard are they working on that? Is that still
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.680]   a big thing for them? They're still working on it. But the challenge is it's still working
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:21.440]   with a source project. It's got a bunch of contributors. But I think they're doing other things as well.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:27.360]   They've been consulting too. Stuff doesn't work quite on it a little bit.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.760]   It works quite well. But the challenge they've got is getting people to pay for it.
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:38.560]   Because there are any of these things. It's a project that you host stuff on.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:43.120]   There are certain people paying for it, but making it sustainable business is harder.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:47.120]   I use with known... You're self-hosted.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.120]   No, I host it with them. I host it with them. Oh, you do. Yeah, mine as well. Why not?
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:56.880]   Also, it means that I'm testing the hosted version for them as well, which is which can be good.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:00.960]   But it's... Well, it doesn't prevent all these indie web standards.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.040]   If you want to play with this stuff, it's one of the easiest ways to do it.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:12.080]   That must be me because I can never get the sharing out. I'll click Facebook and Twitter,
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.000]   and it never goes out anywhere. Oh, yeah. You may need to reauthenticate.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.440]   Facebook, you have to reauthenticate every couple of months. Yeah, I know that. Yeah.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:25.840]   Yeah. I don't know. But I've got that working... I have to go back and play with it.
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:31.360]   Webhooks doesn't work for me. A lot of the infrastructure seems not to be working.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.760]   It's a simple, nice, simple blog, and it works well, but it just... I want it to be...
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.080]   It's a posse for me, right? Yeah, a lot of the value is in the posse, and you're connecting these
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.920]   things together. Yeah. I'll mess with it some more. I like it. I'll pay for it. I renewed it.
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:53.280]   Excellent. Yeah. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, maybe Jeff Jarvis would like to share a number
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.840]   with us. So I guess we're going to go back into a political moment. Not horse population again.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.040]   Oh, good. We're not into that. So I just found this amusing. At the moment that Ted Cruz
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:08.000]   announced, he was pulling out last night, the Google searches for libertarian spike,
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.400]   immensely, libertarian magazine, magazine, which was... Gary Johnson.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:21.440]   Our libertarian candidate for president. Wow. Look at those spikes. That's the entire
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:31.600]   Republican party going, "Uh-oh." Do we have... I know Gary is running. I don't know if he is
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:35.360]   the nominee. Do you have a nominee? I don't know. I don't know how it works there.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:40.480]   Yeah. Oh, he should get a better picture on his website. He's a nice guy. I like Gary, but
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.840]   he needs a better picture on his website. That's actually terrifying. Right out of the sauna.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:55.440]   Being a libertarian with me, maybe not. Not today. Thank you, everybody. This has been fun,
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.480]   as always. It's a great, great... Great to have you, Kevin. That's always... Great pleasure. Yeah,
