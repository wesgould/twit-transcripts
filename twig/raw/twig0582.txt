[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.240]   Jarvis yes and Anne is taking the day off but it makes it's actually a
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.680]   wonderful thing because it gives us a chance to have one of our favorite I
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.520]   don't want to call him a blogger writers on Mike Masnick is in the data
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.640]   what's wrong with the word blogger I think I'm the only one left yeah
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.760]   the last longer tech dirt's Mike Masnick and it's like it's great to have you
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.400]   Mike if you don't read techter every single day you're missing some of the
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.320]   best favorite yes yeah some of the best material not only is it smart y'all but
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.080]   it's snarky and entertaining and accurate and won't my buddy Kharagood
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.920]   also writes over there but it and should we should we should we go right in the
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880]   Google thing because I'm really tempted to do no spend the whole damn show on
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.840]   it oh wait did something happen no nothing happened he's in the data center
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.360]   he doesn't hear anything they updated some things on the Google displays I
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.920]   think yeah I mean that happened we'll get to that when the Google changed
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   like it's actually I want to do your story from today you just filed this
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.800]   right before we went on the air about to bin and zoom and the New Yorker but
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.760]   but you you actually say it's a perfect example of why we need section 230
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.360]   section 230 has been on under assault not just from the the right but who
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320]   who unaccountably think that it's to blame for the fact that they keep the
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.640]   president keeps getting censored on Twitter and Facebook but from the left
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   as well Joe Biden even says he we got to take a closer look he people I people I
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.760]   know are talking to him about that yeah I think he'll I'm sure I think he'll
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.960]   hear I don't hear from tech companies I mean people saying but you quote
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.120]   Shoshone E Weisman who said that this is a perfect example of why we have
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.600]   section 230 and they yeah why I mean do we need to go into what no no no no
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.040]   just say Jeffrey to bid in a zoom meeting did something
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.320]   reprehensible and has been suspended from the New Yorker right but they and the
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.120]   idea is basically just that Jeffrey to bid should be responsible for his own
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.800]   actions and we wouldn't want to hold zoom legally liable for what Jeffrey
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.000]   to boom was doing oh yeah it's not zoom's fault or or do you NYC or host of the
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.920]   zoom call in some worlds they would also be liable for his exactly yes because
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.880]   they they set up the forum in which he he did the thing for which he could
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   potentially face face some legal consequences and the whole nature of
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.440]   section 230 is that it's really just about putting the legal liability on
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.800]   whoever actually did the thing and in this case that's Jeffrey and is not WNYC
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.320]   and is not zoom and therefore section 230 is you know that's that's all that it
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.480]   does effectively and most importantly is placing the legal liability on who
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.120]   deserves it on that person actually you have to say Shoshone's piece in the
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.920]   Washington Examiner does have a sentence you don't normally hear in the Washington
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.000]   Examiner it's she says this is known as the moderator's dilemma in terms relevant
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.840]   to the tube and news zoom would either have to allow everybody to show their
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.960]   genitals on the platform or make sure no one did yes yes the the hypotheticals
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.680]   are this regulatory burden would likely be crushing to new market entrance who
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.040]   didn't even know this was a possibility no lack the resources for robust
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:37.880]   moderation so you know more to the point she she says conservatives who are
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.480]   concerned about a Facebook blocking conservative voices don't understand
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.920]   that if without 230 they'd have to be more aggressive not less yeah and this is
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.040]   like I think I want to write a piece probably for later this week or next
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.880]   week the basically says like you know hey Republicans you know if you actually
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.680]   got your wish and got rid of 230 everything that you think it would do the
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   opposite is probably true because it really like they're mad that certain
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.760]   content is being taken down and yet without 230 more of that content is
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.960]   likely to be taken down because you're increasing the legal liability for the
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.360]   platforms and they don't want to risk it so they're going to you know be be much
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.120]   quicker about taking stuff down or you create the scenario where it says you
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.560]   know please hold five hours for this tweet while we wait for the next reviewer
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.360]   and to check out your tweet and make sure it's okay yeah and Twitter and
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.080]   Facebook conceivably could do that although seems like it would be challenging but
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.320]   for instance I have a chatroom that's going right now if I'm responsible for
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.520]   every bit of content in that chatroom it's going away good bye chatroom yeah I
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.200]   have forums if if I'm responsible for everything posted there I don't have the
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.800]   resources to moderate that goodbye good bye live feed goodbye well now with the
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.360]   live feed I'd be guess I'd be responsible for you guys yes if I if I say
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:09.280]   something just awful and horrible right now because if you went on MSNBC and
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.040]   sent something awful couldn't MSNBC be you know say let's say you said
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.080]   something libelous couldn't MSNBC be sued for libel or no would they be
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.600]   protected by 230 so that that is one area where it is where there is some
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.720]   some weirdness right in that scenario yes MSNBC if it's broadcasting over TV
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   could be found liable for libel there are a bunch of exaggerating
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.520]   circumstances in which they might not be but they wouldn't have section 230
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.360]   protections it was specifically for internet publisher right they would have
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.520]   the protection in some sense for the the online stream and so this is the one
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.040]   area where 230 is slightly and then I mean we could go way deep into the legal
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.240]   weeds about why it's it's not really that different but there is there is a
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:10.080]   little area where the liability regimes are slightly different between online
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.520]   and offline there's another difference which is that MSNBC is regulated well I
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.960]   guess MSNBC maybe not because it's not but they're not
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.600]   so let's just say NBC not MSNBC NBC is a different story because NBC is public
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.760]   airwaves and therefore they're a regulated entity and clearly under the FCC
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.960]   though as of today the FCC has announced its its new theory for why it gets to
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.840]   regulate the entire internet also that was my segue yeah that was my segue
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.080]   because traditionally it's been considered well the FCC has no a
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.680]   jurisdiction and and Congress which is the chief and sole responsibility of
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.720]   Congress to tell the FCC what they can and cannot do what their jurisdiction is
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.960]   has always said they'd have no jurisdiction over the internet right
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   Ron Leiden co-author of 230 said Josh and pie on Twitter back off fella yeah
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.440]   so the FCC has been doing this for a while not the 230 but they've been trying to
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.160]   kind of work their way up the stack as it were they they started that neutrality
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.920]   yeah well no net neutrality is it okay because they're regularly telecommunications
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.120]   companies yeah that's a legit thing but they were talking about apps and people
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.080]   were getting a little concerned if they were gonna go further into apps which
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.400]   would be a noticeable change for the FCC so they didn't do that
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:44.480]   Adjut pie October 15th almost a week ago said that there is bipartisan support in
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.240]   Congress to reform section 230 and that the US Department of Commerce and
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.600]   actually that was the president president's executive order petition the
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.960]   Commission to clarify ambiguities in section 230 they were acting and hit the
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:04.200]   president's behest. Clarence Thomas the justice of the Supreme Court weighed in
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.800]   on this saying that courts have relied upon policy and purpose arguments to
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.040]   grant sweeping protections to the internet platforms 230 that appear he says to
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.400]   go far beyond the actual text of the provision so what what is the
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.480]   justification that Adjut pie proposes sucking up to Trump well besides the
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.520]   family know why we know his motivations but he's got a if we know what he wants
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.560]   to do he's got to come up with a rationale his rationale is oh Mike you go
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.880]   ahead well no go ahead that Stacy you Stacy you have an opinion on this I don't
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.760]   know I was just gonna I mean because because I read the the general council's
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.400]   statement on why they think they can do this is they talked about it coming from
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:59.440]   the communications okay I can do this I
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:08.080]   communications act of 1934 then they said hey they updated that back in 1996
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.640]   with I can't remember that act and basically the idea is that somewhere in
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:20.840]   there they want to where I'm looking for their it's section 509 is that what it
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.640]   was yeah so I can I actually Thomas Johnson juniors statement he's the
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.040]   general counsel for the FCC he says the chairman's decision was consistent with
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.600]   my advice that the FCC has the legal authority to interpret section 230 due
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.840]   to the unique interest generated by this proceedings I have now written this
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.760]   memo so you can understand it he says these issues are complex but our legal
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.400]   authority is straightforward we have the authority to interpret all provisions
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.200]   of the communications act which includes section 230 it's in the communications
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:08.760]   act is that general point of view supported by legal theoreticians Mike it's
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:17.520]   it's complicated is the unfortunate answer this is a they are correct that
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.600]   section 230 is part of the communications act and you know which is almost an
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.920]   accident of history and if you look at the legislative history you have both
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.640]   Chris Cox and Ron Wyden saying that they wrote what became section 230
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.080]   deliberately to keep the FCC away from having a regulatory authority over the
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:44.640]   internet however it is in the communications act which the FCC has some
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.920]   authority over part of the issue however is that the FCC has spent you know I
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.400]   mean many many years now a couple of decades trying to insist that that it
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.280]   didn't actually have that authority and in fact part of the net neutrality
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.440]   arguments are that it doesn't have that authority over you know broadband access
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.080]   providers and so they're sort of flipping every argument they made you know this
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.600]   particular FCC including this particular general counsel has made and is still
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.680]   making in court about net neutrality and they're flipping that on its head and
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.720]   saying of course we have regulatory authority over websites and so I
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.800]   actually wonder if this is going to show up I would be surprised if it doesn't
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.080]   show up in the still ongoing legal fight over net neutrality because here they
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.560]   are saying the exact opposite of what they're saying in court oh oh interesting
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:46.720]   oh yes very interesting yeah yeah so it's I mean yes yes and they got this from
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.400]   several court rulings correct the court rulings around towers yeah he quotes a
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.840]   number of the DC Circuit opinion in Comcast versus the FCC he yeah quotes a
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:07.040]   Iowa utilities board in the city of Arlington there's quite a few precedents
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:14.320]   it looks like his precedents are coming from court cases assertions like tied to
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.600]   the legislation itself and it comes from the fact that they consider the section
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.560]   230 ambiguous and so for instance the Supreme Court in the national cable and
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.320]   telecoms association versus brand X internet service services the FCC may
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.120]   this is the Supreme Court may act as the authoritative interpreter of ambiguous
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.840]   provisions in statutes that it administers of course he does he does in fact
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:50.400]   mention that the congressman Cox said we do not want to create a bureaucracy
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   regulating the internet that's why we're doing this but he says doesn't matter
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.360]   because we have the right we have the right to do it I think some of this is
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.400]   going to be up much like I wonder much like the DOJ lawsuit against Google might
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.600]   be up in the air because we got an election less than two weeks away and
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.720]   there'll be a new Congress in a month or two there may or may not be a new
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   president in January some of this may be up in the air right I mean Congress is
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.080]   the ultimate arbiter of what the FCC cannot do right but you're gonna see
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.720]   you're gonna see regulators trying to try normally in the Trump world
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.320]   regulators were trying to take away every bit of regulation they could before
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:42.680]   January right so in a normal time like before Trump let's call it yes an
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.960]   election would change things a little bit like you might see agencies
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:53.560]   deprioritize things but you rarely would see them like wholesale about face on
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:59.480]   something the current Justice Department though is very unique compared to others
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.000]   so it is really like here the election actually has a lot of big consequences
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.480]   for things like this because I do think we'll see emphasis shifted although there
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.400]   are the attorneys generals of several states who are still trying to sue so
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.600]   we'll see where that that's totally different and might still be relevant
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.040]   can I make one more point on the on the FCC jurisdiction arguments here
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.400]   over why they think they have the authority over 230 you know they we
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   mentioned they named all those different legal cases which you know makes it
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.600]   look like they have some legal backing for what they're doing if you look at the
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.080]   details of every one of those every single one involves a common carrier
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.160]   situation that they're regulating and the assumption among pretty much everyone
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.040]   that I've ever spoken to on these things is that the FCC's authorities
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.640]   regarding communications only applies to common carriers so what they're really
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.480]   doing here in claiming section 201 gives them authority is to effectively claim
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.400]   the entire internet is a common carrier without going through the process of
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.080]   actually proving that which is part of what had to happen in the net neutrality
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.480]   fight so there are among other things among going back on everything that they
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.040]   said before and completely revamping the way that everyone has kind of viewed the
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.680]   FCC's authority going back effectively forever they're also skipping a bunch of
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.720]   the normal procedures that they would go through in order to define a regulated
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.000]   entity so there there's it's a really bizarre move by the FCC and I think it's
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.880]   also one that they might actually regret if if the presidency changes you know
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.760]   in a couple months and also if Congress changes because they're making these
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.680]   statements now that they would not be happy if the if there was a Democratic
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.040]   FCC who was making the same arguments about regulating websites well that's
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.680]   kind of you could that sentence applies with the various changes across the
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.240]   entire board they would not be happy so what are the areas of ambiguity on
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:19.960]   section 230 how could we make tech section 230 better I leave it in the F alone
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.360]   but go ahead well yeah what what are the real areas of ambiguity or what are
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.880]   they claiming are the I'm not worried about what they're claiming because
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.240]   honestly it's very clear what the motivation here is and we can just kind
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:38.040]   of ignore that but but but let's say honorable well intention well-meaning
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:44.480]   people would like to improve section 230 what would we do to improve it is
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.280]   there anything that is to be done is it ambiguous it's worked it's worked very
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.560]   well and Jeff worked very well times mentioned a book called what is it 23
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.040]   words that what is it 26 words created the
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.320]   yeah which if they're quite a there are a number of people in the chat
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.840]   was there I'll get rid of it needs to end right now should read that book before
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:11.000]   they they open yes it's it's it should very much read the book because it it
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.320]   you know you know Jeff is I would say you more skeptical of 230 than than like
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.520]   I am or or I should clear Jeff Casa the author of the book is a little bit more
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.960]   skeptical but he also comes to conclusion that there's no good way to
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.480]   modify the law that won't cause more problems and you know there's a perfect
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.360]   like all laws it's not perfect but it's hard to imagine a way to make it better
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.720]   yeah and and the only ways that I could think of making it better are exactly
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.280]   the kinds of things that no one no one in Congress would ever agree to you know
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:55.800]   there is some some it's not ambiguity but there is like the there's the two key
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.400]   sections to 230 or C1 and C2 and they're drafted in ways that are not exactly
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:07.440]   parallel and so if you could redraft them so that they effectively clarified
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.400]   exactly what it is that they are applying to that might be useful but the
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.040]   courts have basically read it that way anyway so there's there's also a typo
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.840]   they could fix the typo Jeff Casa is really big on trying to get them to fix
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.000]   the typo they reference a wrong section at one point and even I think the you
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   know the the Cornell which hosts all the the legal text has a little note saying
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.200]   we think it means you know that I forget which section they point to instead of
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.600]   the actual section but they could fix that that would help me Leo it's it's
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.160]   because it's 26 words it's it's elegantly simple right it's sword and
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.160]   shield so that we can have conversation online you will not be liable for
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.640]   things others do so that we can have that conversation but so we can have a
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.280]   good conversation you have freedom to take stuff off without setting precedent
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.960]   it's wonderful and its simplicity and I don't think it needs damn thing and the
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.680]   problem is if you open that door you slice the baloney again it got sliced for
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.160]   fast access and you slice it again for hate speech and you just place it again
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.000]   for copyright that's the issue that's the issue and then it's a mess it you if you
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.080]   want to insist on on moderation then you then it has to be moderation you
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.600]   agree with otherwise well then we don't want moderation so it's like it's it's
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.680]   really whose ox is being gored is there any merit to the argument that this was
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.400]   created in the early days of the internet the internet's changed and it
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.320]   doesn't hold as well or maybe it's not as up to date as it should be no no no no it
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:47.160]   works so it's actually your hands actually like a almost a bill of rights in its
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:53.240]   subtle and clarity is the first amendment of the net yeah yes that Jeff is exactly
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.760]   right it is the first amendment of the internet it is very clear it it is
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.960]   understood basically every court has interpreted it the same there are a couple
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.160]   of you know cases on the edges where things have been weird but for the most
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   part it's clear it's concise it works it you know as someone I know says it is
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.680]   set up it's set up in the incentives to get the most good stuff online and the
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.760]   least bad stuff and there are exceptions in the case of you can't say there's
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.440]   criminality there are exceptions you can moderate now there are exceptions it's
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.600]   not the laws that stood still stand yeah right but it just holds that you're not
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.960]   not a publisher this way and the problem is that publishers still talk as if it
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:41.040]   didn't exist oh no if I if I touch that forums I'm gonna be in trouble that's
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.720]   BS not true yeah it's not true at all so if I were to publish could be in Europe
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.000]   could be elsewhere well that's and that's another problem there's no first
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.080]   amendment elsewhere either I mean there's a right we have some very very very
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.400]   good provisions in the Constitution that we don't want to dismantle and I
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.200]   think maybe the solution is to make this a constitutional amendment maybe add it
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.520]   to the bill of rights perhaps boy boy
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.140]   yeah because what the Republicans are doing now you know the whole cancel
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.360]   culture argument is they're trying to say you have to earn your section 230 by
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:22.960]   allowing my hate speech up right and and and and the problem here is the other
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.160]   the third leg of the stool is compelled speech is not free speech so if
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.720]   government tells you you must put something back up which is happening in
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.240]   Italy with Facebook right there was we talked about this months ago there was
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.000]   a fascist site that Facebook chose to took down and the court told them to put
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.760]   it back up that's not free speech either right all right so you know there are
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.720]   a number of assaults there's actually a number of things going on assaulting
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:01.000]   technology there the five eyes plus India and Japan have all come in favor
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.880]   of this Cluesy US Canada Australia England have all come in favor of back doors to
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.360]   encryption there's a really strong movement in that direction there are a
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.400]   few things few areas we really want to kind of as technologists stand up and
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:22.040]   say no no these these are risky and if you understand the issues you will not
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.640]   make these modifications that's the problem with going you know this is where
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.480]   I'm not defending Google Facebook and Twitter I'm defending the internet because
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.600]   the fight against them is gonna set precedence they're gonna affect our
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.040]   speech on the net and that's what worries me yeah Carl Bodie had a very good up
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.160]   piece on the tech dirt along those lines we're gonna get to that actually
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.600]   because really I think that's gonna be most of the show it's a tech church yeah
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:55.680]   but I really think I mean look we actually have have not this DOJ action
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.280]   against Google was announced on Tuesday we really haven't talked about it much
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.360]   our Monday I guess we haven't talked about it much on our shows I've been
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.320]   waiting till this show this is the show where it belongs I should I should
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   finish reading the whole thing well we had a warm up on Sunday with Corey
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.160]   Doctorow and Amy Webb and instead of being a normal Twitter we would talk
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.920]   about the latest iPhone release we didn't talk about at all we talked about if
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.840]   it's possible to regulate big tech how you would do it and what you know whether
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.600]   it can be done effectively what the consequences would be so we had it was
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.640]   kind of a good preamble to the conversation we're about to have Mike
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.960]   Masnick is here from tech dirt couldn't be a better time to have Mike on he's
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.360]   one of the most astute observers of these particular issues it's almost like
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.600]   we planned it Mike thank you for being the universe planned Jeff Jarvis of
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.160]   course from CUNY and the Craig Newmark blah blah blah thank you Craig Newmark
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:59.040]   for blah blah blah and right is that fair should I say that okay okay okay
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   leave your camera on and and I'm joking I'm joking it's a joke and Stacy

[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:37.380]   ye according to the Wall Street Journal it's all over for quibi Jeffrey cats about
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.380]   they don't mention Meg Whitman much anymore I don't know if she's moved on
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.460]   already or she's taken a nap I don't know according to the Wall Street Journal
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.040]   Jeffrey Katzenberg shopped it around said Apple you want our content don't
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:59.900]   you crickets anybody so according to the journal quibi is shutting down
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:05.180]   remember they got two point what was it one point one point seven billion in
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.020]   venture capital just just a couple of years ago this was the streaming service
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:15.340]   that was gonna bring Hollywood to Silicon Valley it's that convergence thing all
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:21.260]   over again and we're gonna show YouTube what it's really all about when you bring
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:26.860]   these great Hollywood creatives that Jeffrey Katzenberg is a story master and
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.060]   you bring all those skills and you spend some money to get high production values
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.620]   you bring them to short videos on on on your skills the PTSD of his own career
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:47.340]   TV you know step three profit actually then there's step four fire sale nobody
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:52.900]   would buy it nobody would buy it yeah there was nothing to buy in in one hand
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:58.300]   you think it launched in April right so beginning of the pandemic and it's
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.860]   shutting down pandemic still happening so in some ways it has gone on forever
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:09.260]   he's it is like quarantine we have been in the pandemic can you say it's a it's
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:16.660]   another victim of COVID-19 no this was a this was overfunded and overproduced
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:24.340]   and just it some I mean this you could call stupid yeah five dollars a month
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.500]   classic Hollywood it is isn't it it's the arrogance of Hollywood in there and
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.660]   and it's exactly you know even and I don't know Schadenfreude here well maybe
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:39.620]   alone Schadenfreude we produce three hour shows we are very different we don't
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:45.660]   do short for and by the way if you tilt the sideways we stay sideways
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.660]   according to the journal I actually did not know about this
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:54.220]   it could be been plagued with problems since it's April launch facing lower
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.980]   than inspected leadership I knew that and a lawsuit from a well capitalized
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:08.060]   foe hedge fund Elliot management oh yeah because of the way their videos you
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.740]   could turn was it the turning of the videos turn style yeah that's that's this
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.820]   groundbreaking I'm putting that in air quotes for those of you listening
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:23.100]   technology which means you could watch it in portrait mode and you get one shot
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:28.420]   and then if you turned it into landscape mode the perspective might change it
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:33.380]   wouldn't merely rotate the video content creators could actually use turn style
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:41.380]   to give you different points of view of the same action apparently a company
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:46.420]   called interlude us said that's our technology you have to stop it or or
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:51.460]   license it quibi said no no no we're not in we're not infringing on their
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.380]   patents it's a meritless lawsuit but this litigation you know it's funny because
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:03.420]   Jeffrey Katzenberg is notoriously litigious yeah so anyway so Facebook
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.660]   refused to buy it NBC refused to buy it whatever was take the content it's just
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:12.060]   it just goes away I put up another story just a minute ago variety talking about
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.180]   the hand-wringing at the broadcast partners because they were getting a big
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:22.780]   hook at 1.75 billion it's just like the 2000 crash right venture capital used to
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.860]   buy out of the people it was a Ponzi scheme of sorts and so 60 minutes had a
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.500]   quibi version 60 minutes they hired the brilliant Wesley Lowry to do it from
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.900]   the Washington Post and he was there up in the air and they're trying to find
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.740]   some you know they have it they have investments it's like it's the pivot to
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:42.380]   video strikes again they also they're there you know the money the investment
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:48.020]   came from Disney Comcast's NBC Universal AT&T's Warner Media so they don't feel
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.900]   any sympathy no just let it or money money is going back goes back is was
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.580]   there anything left but what about poor Chrissy Teigen and Anna Kendrick and
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:03.740]   Liam Hemsworth they're gonna be just fine seriously I'm not they're gonna be
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:11.260]   fine I worry about Burgess Titus Burgess he needs this work actually he does NBC
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.020]   news some staffers who worked for the units now shuttered peacock productions
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:22.540]   were given work on several quibi series I do yeah I feel bad for like non-famous
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:28.380]   people who got quibi deals but hopefully they'll be okay there's you know there's
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:33.700]   lots of money being thrown around by YouTube and Twitch and Facebook and
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.380]   this but this stuff ticked I didn't watch any of it is subscribe but I've got to
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.060]   believe given its paid parentage it's crap it's big old Hollywood it's well
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:48.820]   produced crap but but entertaining I watched some of it but it wasn't
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.660]   entertaining enough to pay five bucks a month plus by the way even with five
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.780]   bucks a month you got ads you had to pay more to get rid of the ads or the
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.380]   500,000 slubs who did this was it was it was no no no no no no no this is what
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:05.340]   they had it three three months free and after the three months ran out we
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:11.860]   reported on this apparently only about 72,000 people remain so I went through
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   that with entertainment weekly where we had a risk free offer four weeks free
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:23.300]   and young people kids teenagers of course quote-unquote subscribed and then
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.980]   when the bill came they said I don't anybody I'm not paying for this I got
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.100]   four free issues and so then that's when they went after me and saying they're
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.020]   all canceling I said they were canceling they just didn't they never were
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.340]   subscribers yeah money they were never subscribers you counted them you should
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.460]   know I still I am I mean I have to say I'm a little sad I as a content creator I
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:47.740]   you know I feel bad for anybody who creates content and can't make it work
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.260]   you know and there's a little Sean Freud because it is after all you know
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.100]   Hollywood's idea you got this you got the sense that the the kind of
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.980]   patronizing sense that oh you Silicon Valley guys you think you can do this
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.660]   happens to podcasting right now all the big media companies doing podcasts oh
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:13.140]   you think you could have podcast but do you have will Ferrell no I don't I don't
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:18.900]   think I think when you create content that is your job right you have to be a
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.580]   tune to your audience this happens and so they're used to it cats at Birx had
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:28.060]   flops I don't feel bad for them I don't think I mean yes there was a lot of
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:32.060]   hubris on this will be well produced this isn't like all snapchat stories
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.620]   exactly or Instagram stories yeah whoever stories or TikTok anyway but they also
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.820]   didn't come at it from the Internet is all about your audience and knowing them
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.620]   and talking to them and by God you have to think though that Katzenberg sitting
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:52.740]   in his office for martini's in going some guy in a longboard drinking
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.740]   crannab
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:02.620]   yeah it's doing an audience of what to do better than my multi-million dollar
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:09.660]   billion million Chrissy Teigen in court so there it's also the revenue model I
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:14.180]   mean no one would pay five dollars to watch what was his name Jose Agat
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:20.580]   Akato yeah I don't know yeah no one would pay that much money for that but
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.740]   it's it's free it's free it's ticked but this is yeah you know but it's also the
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:30.340]   fact that like you know TikTok is user-generated where you have you know a
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.140]   million different attempts you know and there are so many other things on there
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:40.060]   that and even you know even the guy who did the cranberry juice skateboarding
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.820]   video said he didn't think it was anything special it was just trying to
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.900]   know what get to work it wasn't right his card broken down he had a
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.900]   longboard in the trunk and he thought well I'll make a TikTok while I drink
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:57.740]   my cranberry juice and by the way Fleet with Max dreams is now in the top 10
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:05.940]   charts again son that was made 43 years ago Stacy's bless America this is the
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.620]   audience doing this right with mass I'm reading up again on mass fear theory and
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.980]   and the idea was that oh my god we're gonna give them what they want no we
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.100]   don't want to do that we want to we want to tell them what we're gonna give
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.540]   them and we just give it to them and I hope Hollywood has fine they they've
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.260]   never seem to learn this lesson but they don't but they are constantly this is
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.540]   the two different models we've talked about this before the the YouTube model
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.860]   which is or the TikTok actually does it even better which is make it really
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.540]   easy for as many people as possible to create content and post it give them
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.300]   music give them all the pieces give them all the parts but you're gonna get a
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.580]   million videos and then let the algorithm surface the ones people like so
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.780]   that you make an incredibly compelling product for free all you had to do is
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.300]   create a product and versus Hollywood which says no we're gonna make 10 movies
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.700]   we know nine of them are gonna flop at that number that big one you see is a
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.860]   10 pole is gonna make so much money we're gonna be wealthy and that model is
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.660]   failing in the face of YouTube TikTok the blockbuster in a in a world of
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:10.060]   abundance the blockbuster model dies because there's not enough and music
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:14.820]   finally learned that sorry Mike yeah and let me let me bring this back around to
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.380]   the earlier conversation multiple earlier conversations all of this is
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.060]   possible the TikTok model the YouTube model all of that is possible because of
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:28.980]   section 230 I like it that these that these sites can host this and the you
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.620]   know the the Hollywood folks who are trying to get rid of section 230 are
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.020]   because they're trying to turn the internet into something they can only do
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:40.900]   the broadcast model the Hollywood model of well produced but you only get 10 a
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.260]   year and we're going to decide for you and that's that's the difference it's
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.140]   also why I'll bring it back even further I'm I'm all about making connections
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:54.620]   today the reason that Joe Biden has suggested that he wants to get rid of
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.340]   230 as well is because a whole bunch of his advisors come from Hollywood and
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.740]   come from the movie studios and there of the view that we have to change the
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:07.340]   internet away from this mass communications medium where everybody can
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.220]   participate and everyone can create to one in which the gatekeepers in
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.140]   Hollywood's are the ones who decide what is the good content on the internet
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.620]   advisor was a nice word for what they are their contributors yeah the money
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.140]   guys sure but but the other thing Mike's right right there's there's the
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.900]   opportunity for talent to rise that in no way could rise otherwise I read a
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.100]   wonderful book right now called distributed blackness by Andre Brock
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:38.680]   junior about black Twitter and black culture and how it exists and then there's
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.460]   other talents right there's Sarah Cooper or have you heard of Blair
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:49.300]   Erskine no I put her in line 128 she's one of my favorite lines
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.100]   talent
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:42:01.020]   brilliant a oh let's watch her she's on the Twitter it's about okay she says
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:05.060]   could I play this or is it gonna get us in trouble all right let's turn the
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:10.020]   audio on this is she says I am Jeffrey to have been I am Jeffrey to
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:14.860]   Ben's daughter and I have something to say oh where's the audio you didn't
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.300]   test your audio before and you always do this we're getting started
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.820]   Blair to be there's in here and I just have a couple of things I want to say
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.460]   about my dad Jeffrey to be we know no daughter ever wants to talk about her
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:31.660]   does dangling we are again again look I know what my dad did was inappropriate
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.420]   but you have to understand he's very very old and he still thinks it's too
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.660]   bad to me and 2008 you could get away with stuff like that we know ladies ladies
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.820]   you know we know they did and it's really hurtful to me and my family and my
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:53.140]   dad to see that hashtag me too Ben because I just feel like there's like a
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:57.340]   more there's like more clever thing you could have come up with like Jeff it off
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:09.900]   like we whatever he does is going by my question is as my dad's legal
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.100]   advisor like why was everybody looking at him you know I mean because like on a
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.900]   zoom call you can see everybody's you saying that everybody was just looking
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.420]   at my dad with his with his little little guy that's kind of weird I think
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.820]   that's kind of weird I was a work call and they were doing elections
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:29.100]   stimulus an election simulation and my job feels very passionately about the
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.900]   election so him sit all right don't sue him don't
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.500]   you're not masturbating during work calls in 2020 maybe you don't like your
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.020]   job maybe you need a new job I was saying you know he's been temporarily let go
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.180]   from his job Casey and has inspired him though CNN hasn't fired him because
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.420]   CNN loves to jerk each other off that's something we say oh joke we love
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.740]   CNN these are my dad it's just crazy to me that this is what my dad is in the
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.860]   news for like y'all already been talking about that time he knocked up that much
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.620]   younger woman he was having a fair with and when she came to him like I'm
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.540]   pregnant he was like good luck and she had to force him into taking a
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.140]   paternity test and paying child support and I need to get off right now I'm
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.500]   so sorry okay I had to point out there's no way that would have succeeded in
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.660]   any mainstream traditional form of media right that is just my point yeah that is
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:24.180]   Twitter or baby TikToks a long for TikTok but that is a sui generous that is
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.660]   that is the medium that's what that's what is enabled now yeah is is that some
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.580]   people using culture we've never had so as Mike's point about about big old
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:38.380]   mass culture and and and it's called its competition that's what all this fight
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.860]   and regulation is about is the old guys going for protectionism with the old
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.540]   powers and politics that's what happened in Europe with the get ready for it
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.420]   Leistung Schutzrecht that's what's happened across regulatory boundaries and
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.260]   that's what's happening with the discussion about 230 and I'll bring it back
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:01.700]   home to you run and the Google antitrust it's all about protection it'd be funny
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.220]   if we did all of these really fascinating interesting fun stories and
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.780]   completely forgot about the googler I'm gonna continue to tease it
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.460]   wait wait wait in fact as long as we keep the little over it yeah but to clean
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:20.420]   your brain did you all see the second graders on zoom what their teacher went
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:25.980]   away so this is from Good Morning America please don't sue us
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:35.660]   but we'll try in at least second grade teachers gone guys what happened
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:42.540]   I feel so sorry for second graders that have to go to class
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:57.100]   all of you guys I see that there's a little record sign at the top of the
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:04.060]   screen so the teachers recording this she can watch us and she's the Stephanie
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:11.060]   Higgin bottom of that and the principal could see this
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.420]   yeah look at those bit is like that's creepy
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:25.060]   so we should be here
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.420]   were you like that school Stacy a bit you were which one is
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.420]   just
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:43.020]   me and them that if the principal finds out that video of if we were being bad
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:49.820]   right now she would see us being that's a good very bad every day it's weird
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:56.660]   it's getting big trouble with our parents I'm not kid I am that I am that kid
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:02.260]   right there that one yeah no no no not that one I'm the little boy
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.540]   I'm not
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.380]   I think that's right here
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.380]   I found
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:19.740]   and whoever said we'll be toast whoever said that I'll maybe have toast
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   for breakfast
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:26.740]   I said that sounds really good
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:35.020]   I don't know our number I said that's really good with lettuce
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.300]   oh my god it's like twig about talking about case of
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:45.180]   yeah okay that was great thank you Jeff that was great that was great I liked
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:49.420]   128 but 130 line 130 was even better it had I had to do that to clear your
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.420]   palate and your mind from 128 yeah
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.420]   that's
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:58.220]   yeah I think that this is a point well made I mean I I don't want Hollywood to
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:04.940]   go away I like feature films I like over years you know I like careful for
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:09.620]   instance Aaron Sorkins the child the Chicago 7 have you seen that on Netflix
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.100]   he wrote it he directed it a lot of great actors that's a Hollywood production
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.580]   that's not gonna be on tiktok
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.140]   do you Sorkin drives me berserk but there's no
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.140]   Sorkinism
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:25.060]   really but really where is it it's no it's a Netflix oh good point it's
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.060]   streaming
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.060]   yeah mind
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:33.940]   and that flex is the new Hollywood though let's face that it's it's it's
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.540]   certainly is but where did it come from it it came up from from a Silicon Valley
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.380]   perspective yeah that's a good point yeah
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.900]   and if you look at how Netflix like bifurcates their audience it does like
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.940]   social different social media accounts for different groups of people and
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.380]   targets things there
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:53.420]   that's the true Silicon Valley that that's probably would have helped
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.100]   quibi quibi whatever a little bit more like
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.380]   I only saw ads for that service
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.780]   I mean there's two things there's the business model and the way they tried to
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:07.340]   meet find their audience and then there's the content itself well content
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.860]   it's kind of funny because I mean look
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.340]   Katzenberg's created some great stuff there's nothing Jeffrey Katzenberg's
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:18.680]   name to Shrek okay Shrek's pretty good that's one
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.820]   and Shrek two through five
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.540]   okay and one good idea no he's good made some good stuff but I thought it was
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.060]   funny that his idea of reaching out to Silicon Valley and get some technical
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:33.620]   expertise was hiring Meg Whitman that would you know that was the mistake
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.980]   yes you know so though apparently they didn't get along right one of the
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.340]   articles was that like each of them had a separate floor in the massive
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:47.060]   quibi building and they wouldn't go near each other yeah yeah there was a lot of
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.800]   there's a lot of notice they don't mention Meg at all they said Jeffrey
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.420]   Katzenberg went around trying to sell the content you know what I think that's
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.180]   probably fine for her if I were a man I'd be like yeah yeah you just be
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:04.100]   just backing slowly away from the quibi just slowly back in a way well the
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:08.540]   story about Meg Whitman this week was that she might be considered for a Joe
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.380]   Biden cabinet position yeah they're looking for yeah Republicans who aren't
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:19.220]   tainted is what they're looking for good luck I don't know what Meg Whitman's
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:27.780]   the right well no I think George will's gonna slot right in anyway I'm I'm still
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:32.380]   I'm still working around the cool thing I was like you're still not going
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:37.460]   there huh I'm really trying to to stay did you know the third party sellers
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.580]   made more than three and a half billion dollars from Prime Day 60% more than they
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:47.220]   made last year I'm they sucked this year it had nothing good did it I've
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:51.780]   never bought anything I mean me neither did you buy anything I did I bought so I
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:57.620]   did I bought an Amazon echo enabled all said
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.340]   I'm like as I'm realizing what I bought it I'm like oh I'm gonna have to go
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:09.100]   okay that's that's that's that's the type of thing we don't admit yeah no she
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:15.180]   admits it she not only admits it she has more than one I sold my you know was in
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.500]   my other house so I had to know sit yeah you can't take your faucet with you
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:23.860]   when you sell a house can you see what's it all that's not enabled faucet was you
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:30.300]   can't have it are these business expenses hell yeah that one was not
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:34.500]   actually well you should some of my weirder purposes are but that one was
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:38.100]   not because I I've heard you should deduct some portion of that you're
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.780]   gonna review it on the site and stuff right no I already I already reviewed
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.900]   the I mean it's not something I totally for personal use then you can't yeah
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:54.300]   this is unlikely and this is personal water right right do you drink it during
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.260]   work yeah just say I never use that faucet when I'm not a well now it's my
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:03.180]   office right it's always been mad no exactly yeah I bought this you probably
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.300]   know about this Stacy the my cute you know about this garage door I got one
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:13.060]   too yes this is one of the best I give this as a gift to people and I do it
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:20.500]   because it's cheap like 30 bucks so Lisa we have an you know 10 year old 15
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:26.300]   year old garage door opener and it has a dot you know clicker as my father you
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.220]   say it's a clicker and click click it's got a clicker and oh my gosh y'all it
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:35.100]   remotely lets you know if your garage door is open okay I'm getting there I'm
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.020]   getting their patience give me some time I have a telestory all around it
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.940]   julier broadcast things he's an old fashioned broadcast I haven't talked about
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.660]   antitrust I'm getting all your internet speed he's operating at TV
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:58.940]   I'm Katzenberg speed where was I at the clicker so I got some extra clickers for
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.540]   Lisa because we have two garage doors and we asked Stacy did you ever use a
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:09.480]   road control and actually clicked Stacy no she doesn't even know that was TV
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.740]   remote controls my grand that's how they made sound and it was through the
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:20.580]   sound I have a piezio based light clicker that every time I touch it it generates
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:24.100]   enough electricity so there's no battery inside and that is oh that's clever that
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:29.540]   is a clicker anyway so I wanted a better way to open it so this is a
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.900]   Wi-Fi enabled garage door opener you could put the app on your phone and even
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:38.620]   from here I can open the garage door so it's really not great for opening the
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.660]   garage door like as you drive up I'm gonna tell you this right now really
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.620]   you have to take out your phone and everything right yeah because you're
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.140]   not gonna want to take out your phone what it's good for is you set up the
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:51.700]   notification so if your garage door is open more than a certain number right
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:57.580]   so look see this is my my garage door can you show over my shoulder do you not
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:01.580]   have that anymore we may not have that camera anymore they's the studios by the
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.860]   way I just warning slowly falling apart and when all the cameras are gone we're
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.500]   just gonna shut down it's gonna be an audio podcast and they're gonna be hugely
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.380]   we're gonna come back to our video so this is it says my garage door has been
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:20.060]   closed for three hours watch though I'm pressing the button and the garage door
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:24.300]   now and people are getting scared in my house because when the garage actually
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.900]   doesn't do this when it opens but when it closes it has a bright light and a
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:33.020]   loud alarm see it was just opened and it even says who opened it at what time it
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.780]   is now open now this is what's gonna scare anybody's in the house because I'm
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:42.620]   gonna close it now and it makes up the light goes flash flash and it goes beep beep beep
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:47.780]   like a backing up truck beep beep because what they realized is that there's
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.620]   nobody there watching the garage door closed and if a small child like a
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.780]   second grader looking for toast would you put their head in there it would
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:01.380]   crush them to death so you don't have sensors that's that I mean I have a garage door
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:08.700]   still have sensors because I just have one of those you know 20 year old garage
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:14.260]   door opener things you couldn't do that from here you could oh but why would I
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:22.020]   so Leo is telling this wrong this is why it makes a great game I had a clicker
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:26.940]   go ahead you for people who care about security because a lot of people have
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.820]   garage doors that or garage doors that open inside their house right you can
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.740]   get to your home through the garage so if you leave your garage door open not
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.300]   only someone gonna steal your tools maybe but they can also get into your
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.580]   house yes a lot of people freak out about this yes this thing lets you set a
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.460]   notification so like if it's open for more than 10 minutes it'll pop up on your
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.940]   phone will be like hey your garage doors been open for 10 minutes you want to
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:54.180]   close it and you'll be like yeah that's what this or my wife Jeff you left the
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.180]   garage door but all that again exactly exactly I can my bed I could see if it's
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.300]   open right now it's closed right now here's the thing you're not gonna want to
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:08.620]   do see right here this is why Amazon selling it you can also give the keys
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.780]   to your garage door to an Amazon delivery person so they can open your
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:16.460]   garage door put your package in there and close it does it only open a certain
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:23.380]   amount no no there's a camera that would be good yeah there's a camera
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:28.500]   associated with it so you can check that I do think mine does have a camera no
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:33.660]   you have to buy the camera with like if you want to use key service and by the
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:38.740]   way you pay 33 bucks so it's cheap it only covers one door so I had to buy a
[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.500]   second sensor to the other door but if you want to use $16 you probably got a
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:48.980]   prime deal oh yeah I did yeah that's why I bought it on part I know okay so well
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.060]   that's why that's why I mentioned this because it would be a good prime one
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:55.780]   but you have to pay a subscription fee if you want to work with echo or to do
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:59.740]   the key thing there you have to there's there's that's Chamberlain yeah
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.580]   the reason they did that is because Chamberlain built their own cloud for
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.940]   my cue because they were like they they took the hubris like we were talking
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.300]   about with Hollywood they took it for like an old-school manufacturing company
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.900]   was like we're not gonna trust Amazon's cloud or anybody else we're built in
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.900]   our own that's expensive yeah yeah you're paying for that's why they're
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:22.220]   charging and and it was hard to get working I took me a while I have to
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.900]   had to turn off five gigahertz on my Wi-Fi access point how do you
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:31.220]   have an actual growth I have a pro tip for anybody oh sorry because you mentioned
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.460]   five gigahertz a new your pro tip that'll do my amateur question go ahead pro tip
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:40.340]   okay pro tip if you have the Eros I didn't know this on your hero router and I bet
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:45.900]   Google adds it soon you can actually go in and say hey there's a section in
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.500]   there that says hey I'm having trouble connecting a device yeah turn off 5g
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:53.180]   yeah turns it all right you used to have to call them and they would do it
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:56.300]   but they did that to the interface which is good I have a you I'm all
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:01.020]   ubiquity now and the ubiquity you can do that oh that's right yeah okay Jeff old
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:06.060]   man question how do you tell me how you hook it up to your so it's very
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:11.900]   actually it's really simple there's a it's a peel and stick you pull the
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.100]   battery out and there's a Bluetooth it's really tricky because everything has
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.980]   to be close enough to work there's a Bluetooth thing you put on the garage
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.220]   door and it has to be oriented a certain way that's how it knows the garage door
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:26.420]   is open because it says I'm sideways now I'm straight I'm side-wise I'm straight
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.060]   so that's all that does that goes in the garage door and then this thing which
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:35.980]   is the light and the siren this thing has to get on your Wi-Fi and that was
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.900]   where that was a little tricky and then it uses Bluetooth to connect to the
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:44.540]   sensor on the door and then because this is on your Wi-Fi now you you can use
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.620]   the app to talk to you it just mimics the clicker yeah yeah basically you
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:52.540]   actually get up on your program you program it you have to press the learn
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.260]   button and it says okay I see it now you know but Chamberlain makes I have a
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.620]   lift master and it turns out there's only one company that makes garage
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:05.860]   doors Chamberlain has bought everybody so it owns lift master so it worked
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.220]   Mike did you get anything in prime day were you lost in after anything in prime
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:12.780]   day I did not I do not have Amazon Prime
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:20.180]   I know I'm remaining person without Amazon Prime
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.300]   I'm gonna get
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:28.700]   and so I look at Amazon was offering for prime day you could get prime for a
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:34.820]   week for two dollars and so so my wife actually did so we I think it
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:39.100]   probably ran out now it's been a week right she did by one thing off of
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:45.900]   prime she she bought the the 23 and me they had that oh that was I was
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:51.340]   like let me ask you how do you feel about that how do I feel about the 23
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:56.860]   and me yeah she's her spit is gonna be in a database now yes I know I know we
[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.500]   had a discussion about that I was wondering how comfortable how comfortable
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.540]   she was with the the privacy aspects of that and you know she's she's a free
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:09.580]   person she's able to make her own decisions I have not done 23 and me and
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:16.060]   I probably will not but she figured for her you know trade-offs the trade-offs
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:20.340]   were worth it for her and it's really it's not just for her this is what's
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:25.220]   really fascinating about 23 and me is any of your family members start doing it
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.620]   yes you're in like my daughter is crushed that my husband's entire other
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.580]   side of the family did it and she's like there goes her spy credentials once
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:39.300]   again yeah you are kind of you you are kind of knocking out of kids aren't you
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:44.380]   yeah yes well I talked about this with Esther Dyson and I said well now people
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.900]   will know that that my son could be liable to prostate cancer and she said
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.980]   oh Jeff get over yourself everybody gets it that's true she's right and she
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:01:00.020]   very famously publicly turned gave her entire genome to science I so I so I so
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:06.900]   I should mention just at a fairness I they have my spit and I fact I've done
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:12.700]   several other companies they've all been sponsors what I did learn is it's a
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:18.340]   little disappointing is the technology that they these companies use is not as
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:24.260]   specific as you'd hope you know you when you get your ancestor report the way it
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.700]   works is there it's it's almost statistical they compare your DNA to
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.260]   other people's and then they think well you're probably mostly this well that
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.420]   well I have a story I have go ahead and I'll tell a story I was gonna say the
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.520]   thing that was weird was that you know she was filling it out and she said they
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:46.100]   asked her all these questions about yes and she's like shouldn't shouldn't I do
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:50.100]   this afterwards to see if they actually got the you know if the spit actually
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.980]   told them all this because if I give them all this I feel like they're going
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.260]   to you know just repeat back to me the same answers that I just told them in
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.140]   the text the technical difference is it they're using something called genotyping
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   not gene sequencing and the implication is you know Esther Dyson got gene
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.700]   sequencing her entire genome was mapped with gene sequencing but that's
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:12.580]   expensive they're using something that's a little more statistical it works in
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.420]   fact I'm actually trying to decide because I did it so long ago they now
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.100]   have a new chip they use for this and there are new reports they say I am
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:26.940]   seven percent Italian 32 percent French and German and 44 percent British Irish I
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:32.940]   did find a relative though which was kind of cool yeah like a second cousin
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:37.100]   that I actually after I looked at it I realized oh yeah that actually that she
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.820]   is my second cousin so it did I did better than that would you hear my story
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:50.140]   yeah so my grandfather in West Virginia up the hauler was born to the woman that
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:53.820]   he thought was his sister but was actually his mother and his grandmother
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:59.540]   was acted as his mother because his real mother got impregnated by a
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:06.020]   coal mine work yes these things happen and they happen and so when we never
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:13.660]   knew details we never knew the name we had a few clues and apparently from
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:19.420]   Buffalo worked the the gas mines as did my grandfather that's what you do in
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:24.380]   the hauler and we had no idea my grandmother threw away there were some
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:29.420]   love letters tonight and they were thrown away my grandmother was ashamed of this
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:33.500]   we never knew anything we couldn't get it well guess what 23 and me and my
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.300]   daughter's ability with ancestry and such my if he if he had made her an
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:44.860]   honest woman as they used to say my name would be Riley interesting I'm gonna
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.300]   call you Riley just a book yeah life of Riley yeah I got that through
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:53.860]   that's a reference that Stacy will not understand because she's too young but I
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:04:01.260]   got that through 23 of me interesting I don't I don't think there's anything
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.980]   wrong with it it is the case that they have your spit which they could do a
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:12.460]   full gene sequencing from at some point so your wife she is in a museum
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:22.780]   people's people really old spit hey what about antitrust okay
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.060]   I wish we do the change long for us no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding we're
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.860]   gonna do the antitrust but first we're gonna take a break to hear a for a word
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.740]   from our sponsor he said and I a lot of people know that I've been an
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:40.500]   ESET user and fan for a long time but maybe what you didn't know is that so
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:45.620]   it's twin fact I didn't know that my daily question when I see your IT guy he's
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.860]   only here he's a contractor managed service provider so he's not our
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.900]   employee but we see Russell you know every few times a week right John and my
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.660]   question for him lately every day every time I see him is are we safe are we safe
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:02.340]   because I am terrified that we're gonna get bit by ransomware you read these
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.940]   stories and these companies and the cost and then it's just a nightmare and he
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.580]   always says we're safe well now I know why he says we're safe he does a lot to
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.740]   protect us including it's not just but it's I don't want to tell you the whole
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.220]   thing because it's you know we don't want to give the bad guys any information
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.940]   but I am willing to tell you one of the techniques he's been using is is he set
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:29.780]   for over 30 years ESET ESET has been a leader in cybersecurity this is what we
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:35.500]   use to protect all of our staff and even our remote work from home staff from
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:40.660]   malware ransomware is a small business we need enterprise grade security but it
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:44.180]   can't slow us down it can't interfere with the workflow in fact one of the
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:49.700]   great things about he said is I didn't know no one knows it's running and what's
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.900]   really great about he said is it is and this is something I really have always
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:00.300]   valued with he said it is able to block even the newest threats new zero days
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:05.660]   are coming out all the time any viruses don't know about them because they're
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:10.780]   zero days they're brand new but ESET does something super cool called dynamic
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:17.380]   threat defense if they see an attachment on an email or a suspicious blob they
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:22.940]   upload it to their cloud they have a cloud-based sandboxing technology they
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.540]   can actually run it in their cloud watch its behavior and identify if it's
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:31.020]   suspicious they don't have to have the virus signature they can actually
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.420]   execute it to see what it's doing analyze it and then if it is malicious
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:39.500]   they block it even before it reaches your inbox before it reaches your network
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:45.140]   dynamic threat defense this is brilliant he says multiple layers of protection
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:50.500]   it's very light on the footprint it does not use CPUs you don't even know it's
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:55.300]   there you can get it on-prem you can get it in the cloud you in fact they're
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.140]   very flexible you can buy it directly from ESET but you could do what we do
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.540]   which is get it through our managed service providers most managed service
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:05.900]   providers offer it because it works so well there's also an ESET reseller
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:11.220]   program so whatever option is fine with me any option that works for you there's
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:15.780]   a security management center that gets a gives you gives Russell a real-time
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:21.060]   overview of all the on and off-prem endpoints even the laptops that are at home
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:25.740]   with our staff full reporting automated security management for all the
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.580]   operating systems we use you can access it wherever you have internet we have
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.820]   literally been using ESET for years trusted by thousands of state and local
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.620]   governments top universities and enterprises worldwide and of course if
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:42.820]   you are an industry that has compliance requirements like GLBA or PCI or HIPAA
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:49.060]   it supports all the requirements if your employees are your first line of
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:53.220]   defense and when they work from home they are working without a net that's
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:57.020]   why you need ESET they have a remote workforce bundle for advanced ransomware
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:01.140]   and business data protection that's part of all of their different bundles that
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.420]   they offer you to protect your employees no matter where they are look at the
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:09.460]   reviews independent testing labs say ESET's number one for minimal system
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.620]   impact and extremely accurate detection and this new dynamic threat defense
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:18.940]   makes it even more important a great fit for small and medium businesses I
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.780]   hope you'll check them out ESET understands the security needs of our
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.340]   small business and yours to trust ESET to future-proof your business get an
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:36.380]   interactive demo right now at try.eset.com/twit that's try.eset.com/twit
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:43.340]   to get a free trial of ESET's award-winning endpoint protection this just
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:51.580]   in San Francisco has just passed the Karen Act this is not a joke is a ban to
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:09:01.060]   racist calls to 911. C-A-R-E-N it's it's a acronym the caution against racial
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:05.260]   and ex is that a great name caution against racial and exploitative non
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:15.180]   emergencies act 11 yes votes unanimously the Karen act. So I just switched over
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.620]   I'm sorry I didn't listen to commercial but I'm Obama speaking down
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:25.980]   Philadelphia yeah and it's a a drive-in rally so instead of applause they're
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.660]   hunky I love these I love these drive-ins they're just the greatest John's
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:34.500]   favorite group I'm freeze McGee's as drive-in concerts now Wow who would have
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:40.180]   fought in 2019 you know you know what's gonna be big in 2020 drive-ins
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:50.540]   what and they honk they all get the I'm freeze concert do yeah okay you should
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:55.300]   do a drive-in podcast recording we could do that yeah we used to we always had a
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:00.740]   studio audience we got all these chairs we could do it in the parking lot
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:07.380]   well that's exciting yeah I can do it that's not
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:19.020]   okay so talk about Zumtopia what's Zumtopia Zumtopia was last week you know
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.460]   I want to learn it does search on play among us I want to play among us Taylor
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.620]   Lawrence did a whole article last week in the
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.620]   busy your torture
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.260]   just got to get in their hands
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:45.820]   all right what all right Google okay okay okay only the biggest story so far of
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:51.420]   the week and it also happens to be of the week of the year maybe of the
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:56.460]   decade no barely the week well I do want to point out the United
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:02.180]   States Department of Justice in the last 11 years it's only filed one and he
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:08.540]   trusts lawsuit so this is a big deal they're not known for their
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:13.140]   aggressive is not known for justice either so it's a political act that's
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.180]   gonna go away and then get redone so well and I should point out nor was
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:22.820]   Obama's nor was was George W. Bush's there was in between now in the last 10
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.380]   years has only been one it's just not I don't know where we don't care about
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:33.620]   oh it was a politically motivated one as well oh what was it I can't remember
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:38.780]   I'll find it because there were there were a few I don't I don't know the actual
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.740]   losses but there were two things that were politically motivated one being
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:49.020]   trying to block the AT&T time warning that was it because because Donnie didn't
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:54.900]   like CNN which is exactly that was the one but there was also there was also I
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.900]   don't know if it was a lawsuit but there was action about the car
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:04.140]   companies agreeing to to emissions guidelines with California they said
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:09.140]   that was collusion that's also as well right also also politically motivated
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:14.720]   but when it comes to mergers between a well I don't know team mobile and
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.040]   sprint before I mean we go on and on and on and this one was joined by 11
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:25.320]   states all over the republicans geez this is clearly parking saws in on this
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.480]   which is not to say that there isn't some merit in the notion that Google is
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.920]   perhaps acting anti-competitively based on its size and dominance but but this
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.960]   lawsuit is not it this is not it yeah I you know I wrote something where I was
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.280]   just like if you really support antitrust against Google and you really
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.960]   think that they need to be broken up or there needs to be some sort of punishment
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:52.760]   for this is not the vehicle it is so poorly done it is clearly rushed and it
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.600]   doesn't hit on any of the points that most people think about or most people
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.640]   talk about when they're talking about antitrust in Google you say their case
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.920]   is weak yes you also point out or maybe it was Carl what have you pointed out
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:12.200]   that they in their actual brief they publish things that one might say we're
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:17.800]   good you know as proof that they were monopoly dirty monopolist we're actually
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.200]   you know maybe not so no so bad I'm trying to find it's a weaponized farce
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:30.480]   Carl Bowie wrote yesterday yeah among other things well Nila actually said
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   this this is Neil I Patel tweeting of the verge in section 143 the DOJ writes
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.680]   the Google was concerned that a major United States carrier would ask manufacturers
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:49.320]   to install a search widget powered by the carriers in-house search engine you
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.560]   all love Verizon search right Google's VP of partnerships wrote to a colleague
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.360]   Google needed to make clear to manufacturers that these customization
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.960]   requests will not go far replacing the Google search widget with a different
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.200]   search box would violate the pre-installation agreement so Neil I Patel
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.160]   says Google harshly stopping carrier bloatware is again not the best argument
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:19.520]   for the DOJ yes they did they prevented I was it do you know who the carrier was
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.400]   off the top of your head Mike I don't actually in that one I don't remember
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.080]   yeah it's pretty funny but almost almost every argument in the filing reads like
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.200]   that there are all these things where like they're perfectly reasonable you
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.640]   know consumer protective or consumer friendly explanations for each of these
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.920]   decisions and the DOJ presents it in the most nefarious fashion that anyone with
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.120]   any sense of how these things work should say no like if they had gone the
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.320]   other way they you know there would have been all these these crazy
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.120]   accusations about Google you know enabling bloatware for example or you
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.280]   know creating security problems or you know each one of these decisions was
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.880]   reasonable and and like you know there was another one that I wrote about
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.920]   earlier today where they talk about the fact that you know Google is paying 15 to
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.200]   20 percent of Apple's revenue to get you know to be the preferred search engine
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:18.360]   on iOS you know like they're paying billions of dollars that's not the
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:24.680]   action of a monopolist right you know monopolist would want to cut you
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.960]   but here's 15 million dollars yeah yeah you want to see monopolies look at your
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.200]   ever escalating Comcast bill and then you will see you know knopoli well that's a
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.880]   really good point because because Department of Justice has done nothing to
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.000]   slow down the aggregation of telecommunications companies and they are
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.520]   no they've actually they're going to do anything and supporting it yeah I would
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.680]   say I wanted to tell you though the Department of Justice in the last few
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.040]   years has been very active in the food industry because when you were talking
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.120]   about them not doing cases I was like no that's not true because I've been
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.320]   reading about some crazy ones on my podcast but they went after big chicken
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.960]   big tuna and bid meat packing I'm just telling you so so there's a different
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:15.680]   industries the what I'm quoting is the fact that is an actual lawsuit so there
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.720]   been investigations there been you know they've been in dieting putting them in
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:25.320]   jail well for criminal abuse behavior sure for antitrust yeah well it's for
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.800]   collusion it's the antitrust right right so it's collusion and it's easier to
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.840]   prove things like well it's not easy to prove collusion but that's also I mean
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.400]   in the US our antitrust actions need to be you need to prove consumer harm
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.280]   right which and it's important like it's easy to say oh chickens customer or
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:50.000]   tunas price fixing when it comes to Google literally nothing maybe not
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.640]   literally nothing very few things like Mike was saying and you know we're
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:17:00.120]   talking about none of these are consumer harms and I I would argue and I'm just
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.200]   gonna throw this out here just to make our argument a little bit more fun that
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.360]   maybe when it comes to tech monopolies if we're gonna look at this seriously
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.320]   we should look beyond just consumer harms because it can be hard to show
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.920]   that although with Google you could show it with again the ads the ad
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:24.360]   industry we've talked about that and I'm also curious why they went after they
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.400]   didn't go after Amazon because it's not like the Trump administration loves Jeff
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:34.000]   well Tom Cotton says winter is coming for big tech so could get there could get
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.880]   there winter is coming didn't wasn't that part of the house Democrats report
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.720]   there for that 450 page report was a suggestion that antitrust laws should be
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.360]   probably amended to show more than just consumer harm to show anti-competitive
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:56.120]   harm and stuff like that there's been a big push for that you know generally more
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.400]   from the Democratic side that the consumer harm standard which was sort of
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.000]   that was kind of a mainstay of the Republican viewpoint of antitrust that
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.240]   like it was like Robert Bork's big big deal and so they've been arguing for
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.200]   what is sometimes referred to as hipster antitrust which is to get past this
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.840]   idea of of consumer harm being being the issue and there are some interesting
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.480]   arguments there but you know this final is not there yet why do they call it
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.120]   hipster antitrust out of Korea what's hipster about it I don't understand it
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.240]   because it's changing you know we have this this accepted way of doing things
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:41.680]   and this is the new hip so Googles response which I guess I should mention
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:47.920]   I mean you know not yes you should yeah I mean give them a good response yeah
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.520]   this is from Kent Walker who's a senior vice president of global affairs in the
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.280]   keyword blog today's lawsuit is deeply deeply flawed people use Google because
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.280]   they choose to not because they're forced to or because they can't find
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:08.560]   alternatives but it is true one of the one of the accusations is the deals
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.080]   that Google makes with carriers to make sure that the other search engines aren't
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.760]   on those phones where you can change it and 14 but you can change it yeah so I
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.840]   guess that's forced to it's just like it's you know this funny thing is they're
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.760]   going after the browser which is like going back 20 years but I'll let you get
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.560]   back to his answer in a second but but the problem is I think that it's always
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.840]   yesterday's war when it comes to antitrust and to go after search I think
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.840]   search is outmoded I think it's it's got cobwebs on it I think that we have we
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.240]   need far better services and systems to get us to expertise and authority and
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:47.520]   relevance and Google's behind somebody's gonna come along and
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:55.080]   and beat it and and I think that this idea that it it owns search is is the
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.680]   least of the problem well advertising that's where the issues are let me
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:03.280]   finish the statement but I do have a question along those lines I would like
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:10.760]   to we talked a little bit about this on Sunday I'd like to pose to Mike along
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.840]   these lines so we'll get I'll get to that but anyway today's lawsuit is
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.000]   deeply flawed blah blah the lawsuit would do nothing to help this is Google
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.200]   would do nothing to help consumers to the contrary would artificially prop up
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.960]   lower quality search alternatives raise phone prices and make it harder for
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.640]   people to get the search services they want let's talk specifics the
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.120]   department's complaint relies on dubious arguments to criticize our efforts
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.480]   yes like countless other businesses we pay to promote our services billions of
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.000]   dollars to companies like Apple just like a cereal brand might pay a
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.040]   supermarket to stock its products at the end of the row or on a shelf at I level
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.120]   for digital services when you first buy a device it kind of has a home screen I
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.040]   level shelf on mobile that shelf is controlled by Apple as well as companies
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.080]   like AT&T Verizon Samsung LG on desktop computers of really well-manly
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.480]   controlled by Microsoft so we negotiated agreements with many of those companies
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.880]   for I level shelf space in other words the default search engine is Google but
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.760]   let's be clear our competitors are readily available to if you want to use
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.600]   them it's true every browser you could change search and it often gives you
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:19.560]   suggests alternatives like DuckDuckGo and Bing and Yahoo and other search engines
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.360]   our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers they go on to
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.760]   say is are no different from the agreements with many of the many other
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.320]   companies have traditionally used to distribute software I guess the thing I
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:36.680]   wanted to ask Mike and this was this was actually asserted by the Department of
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:41.760]   Justice there's such a thing as the network effect Jeff says oh somebody
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.120]   else could come along and displace Google or Facebook but isn't it the case
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:52.560]   that at some point Google is so big has so many such a big database it's hard
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:58.040]   to displace it isn't there a network effect I mean there is some argument to
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.920]   that the question is when what does that mean for antitrust purposes I think
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:07.320]   there you know these things do change over time and there are reasons to think
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.760]   that Jeff is might be correct that there are different ways to approach it it
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.560]   won't be I think by creating just like you won't make another Google it won't
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.960]   be the same yeah yeah something that well remember how worried Google was
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.520]   about social search and that became the number one effort of Google for a
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.680]   while with Google plus because they were afraid that the knowledge graph that
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.760]   Facebook was creating was actually more valuable than search how does Google
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.160]   have a network effect Facebook yes how does Google have a network effect outside
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:37.040]   of that I think well I think there's an argument that you know Google search is
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.040]   improved by more people searching on it and that's what aren't from that that's
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.240]   what the DOJ said is because of this large market share 80% right J.S.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.160]   search they are collecting more data who's gonna come who can come along and
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:55.640]   compete with them they can't collect that data yeah maybe there's also the
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:00.280]   the fact that Google can pull in so many other things into their other products
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.040]   so when they launch a new product it is much more competitive from the get-go
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:09.920]   so if you in I mean if you look at things like just I'm trying to think of
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:14.080]   some of the services I use that like Google Maps can now tell me exactly how
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.280]   many people not exactly how many people sorry can tell me if a place I'm about
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.840]   to go is crowded or not those are things it can only do because it has you know
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.680]   Android phones and is pulling that's not exactly antitrust but it is a network
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:33.840]   effect brought about by the fact that the people use their stuff sorry it's
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:39.440]   okay well this and this is actually Google's response to that particular
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:43.280]   point there's another area where the lawsuit is wrong this is again from the
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.000]   keynote blog about how Americans use the internet it could it complains we
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.720]   compete only with other general search engines that's demonstrably wrong people
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.280]   find information in lots of ways they look for news on Twitter flights on kayak
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:02.800]   and Expedia remember Google owns iTap or IATA rather rest which is which actually
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.040]   I think has put hip-munk and some other travel search engines out of business
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:13.360]   because Google controls the database of flight information so there there are
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.320]   I'm look at I am not saying Google is not a monopolist I think they are but I
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.520]   don't know if this is the right way to approach it restaurants and open table
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.960]   recommendations on Instagram and Pinterest this is actually a very
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:28.360]   telling point when searching to buy something around 60% of Americans start
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:34.960]   on Amazon that's a very credible argument Amazon is a big competitor to
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.280]   Google search and now an advertising search and advertising yeah and the
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.720]   argument they make that oh the Amazon fire phone failed that's Google's fault
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:50.080]   no was a crappy phone we all know I fire a argument yeah yeah and and it also
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.200]   undermines their argument because part of that that has to do with the like
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.360]   non-forking agreements this is the DOJ is arguing that if you you know if you
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:01.760]   want to have Android and Google services together Google makes you
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.160]   require that you won't fork it and to you know create your own true it I was
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:12.320]   in a Amazon did exactly and so that but then immediately they point to Amazon
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.280]   which did exactly what they're saying nobody will do because of Google's thing
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:20.080]   but but the fact that Amazon did it shows that their their entire argument is
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:30.000]   not not accurate it was right yeah Stacey's left the building and well I'll then
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.920]   I'll jump in and keep talking I mean the other argument that's weird about it is
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.800]   you know they talk about these these agreements to get search you know to be
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.640]   the default to get Google to be the default and yet you know you look at
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.840]   things like the chrome browser which has a huge market share and is not the
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:52.200]   default browser on nearly every computer you know most Windows machines
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:57.320]   come with you know whatever Microsoft is calling their thing today edge and you
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:02.360]   know and the Max comes with Safari and yet people choose to go to Chrome because
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.440]   they find it to work better for the most part and so this idea that like having
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.240]   these default deals you know is preventing people from going elsewhere
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.520]   doesn't actually seem to be supported by the way that people actually act when
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:20.200]   it comes to computers I use Chrome because my office is cold and I need my
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.960]   fans running all the I mean that's a good point I use Firefox I don't use
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:31.400]   Chrome it is true that the chromium engine has become more and more dominant
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.040]   not just because of Google's Chrome but Microsoft's edge that doesn't mean Google
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.480]   data it's a gift to the ecosystem yeah I think you can make the same case for
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.360]   Android yes same thing yeah you can use you could you could be Amazon and screw
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:51.000]   up Android and and fine it's a gift to you it's free
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:57.240]   yeah it's this is politically motivated as hell I think it starts with what
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:02.440]   Stacey's been saying do we want to or do we not want to reconsider the
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:07.040]   definitions of antitrust it starts legislatively this is trying to bring
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:16.000]   him to the DOJ based on current law no it's there's no consumer harm there's
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.440]   some advertiser issues I will I'll be the first to grant that but even then
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:26.200]   Amazon's growing Facebook's grown TikTok's growing so you know competition
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.800]   lack of competition is harder to prove there but you know we can have that
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:36.000]   discussion but in which current laws yeah in which there was a congressional it
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.080]   was at the house the Senate that did the 430 something or 60 something page
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.960]   report because they did that on anti was it antitrust the house yeah the house
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:53.760]   judicial committee yes subcommittee trust up commut issue oh okay yeah that one
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.680]   you read that report they actually talk about things like network effects and
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:02.400]   I'm not saying it's the end all be all but the discussion is beginning now
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.800]   given where we are in the way the world works right now I have no optimist
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:13.040]   something that we will know get a lot passed but it's it's I mean it's
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.440]   important to note that like that the the house report on antitrust was that was
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:23.560]   done by Democrats and the Republicans put out their own sort of dissent and
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.960]   they had fought about it they tried to put together a sort of bipartisan
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.720]   report and nobody could agree which some of the points in there were I mean
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.560]   some of the points they did agree on sure I mean well it's a yes there there
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.880]   there are some areas of a row it's the same thing with 230 and antitrust right
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:43.280]   there are because you know in both cases like everybody is seeing certain things
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.480]   about about the technology industry that they don't like but they're
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.360]   completely disagreeing on how and why and how to deal with it and so you know
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.640]   where they come down on all these things is very very different and would have
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.600]   very very different impact and so you know there are some interesting things
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.840]   and certainly the house report at 400 pages is a lot more thorough but it also
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:08.000]   had some really weird things in there yeah some really sloppy things some some
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.600]   things that were so old and no longer relevant that never were very strange
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.920]   like a bad high school paper and spots yes well that and that's the the argument
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.080]   that the DOJ lawsuit is like a bad law school student you know attempt at
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.520]   writing a brief but you know it's easy come I mean the biggest problem is well
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.400]   what is the remedy and it's in part I think it's almost impossible to think of
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:35.520]   a remedy that would not have well all of these are gonna have consequences yeah
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.320]   well they're gonna have intended consequences and unintended consequences
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:46.960]   that's where your goal is yeah let's assume the goal is to foster innovation
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.560]   to increase a competitive competition in the markets that Google and let's add
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:59.040]   Microsoft and Facebook and Amazon and Apple into that as well in those markets
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.400]   to create more you know I thought the the house's report was pretty damning on
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:09.120]   Apple the stuff the the smoking email it's one gun emails they got an Apple doing
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:14.040]   side deals when they claim again and again that their their app store is you
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:20.440]   know fair to everybody is well I thought was pretty on the face of a pretty
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:27.240]   blatant evidence of collusion so I think there it wouldn't it isn't I don't
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:32.200]   want to throw out the baby with a bath water there is some merit to these the
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:38.080]   questions there's probably merit go ahead Stacy in the go ahead there's
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:42.280]   merit in some places like I think an interesting spot to look for antitrust
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.400]   is to start looking at online marketplaces whether that's the app store
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:54.640]   whether that's Amazon's you know Amazon and how it does or Google's online ads I
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:59.960]   mean so if you think about online marketplaces are a really interesting place to
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:06.040]   start making rules I think you can't if you're gonna approach antitrust for tech
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:10.880]   you can't do it on a company basis you have to do it on like hey let's talk
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.240]   about data interoperability let's talk about how you treat marketplaces so
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:18.640]   that's how I think we should approach it right yeah yeah if you think if you
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:24.160]   there's there's you've got to start with is their damage and is there damage
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.720]   that's not covered by the law now then you consider a new law around that you
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.960]   start with evidence of the discussion we're not we're not there we're starting
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.280]   with emotion you should back to your point back to your point one point I
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.840]   you know if you do have if we do not would I'm yes I'm gonna be political
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.720]   right now have a clean sweep of Democrats then I think you could end up
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.800]   with new antitrust law you'll have Elizabeth Warren in there saying now is
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.080]   the time to pay up and here's what it's gonna look like and I think that that
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:57.280]   could make a big difference yeah okay that's my yeah
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.200]   well they would be a very different kind of argument oh yes oh yes but it
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.800]   would but it would go to what Stacy's trying to spin that right yes does says
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.000]   very well has been saying is that it's about starting with the discussion is
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.800]   rather than starting with this document exactly yeah if the government goes
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.120]   entirely to the Democratic side and you have both houses of Congress and the
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.160]   presidency you would almost certainly see some sort of new antitrust you know
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.960]   regulations introduced that would probably open things up and and sort of
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.360]   take this you know hipster antitrust approach two things so Stacy whether
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.880]   or not that of course would would you know whether or not the courts would
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:43.120]   allow that to happen all separate right these courts particularly right yes
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.680]   yeah so Stacy where would you start if you if you had a clean slate clean
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:51.040]   whiteboard with a clean slate of Democrats in and you wanted to have the
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:56.920]   discussion that you you ask for around antitrust power size whatever where
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.960]   would you start where would you start the the research on damage to be
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:07.760]   mitigated so I don't read antitrust papers in my spare time I want to make
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:14.000]   that really a lot of dirty things but not that I read spectrum papers and I
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.600]   read encryption papers but I do not read antitrust papers so I can say to
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:27.120]   some I think Mike might might better be better answer I will say the things I
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:37.360]   worry about are amalgamation of data and using that to improve products and
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:43.360]   the way that companies can kind of create as Amazon you know their famous
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.320]   flywheel I don't know if there's a way to stop that that's not that doesn't
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.640]   produce more harms but that's like an area where I think there is you know
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.080]   combined like there's a lot happening there that's really interesting and I
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.920]   think there are potential harms down the road for that and where would you start
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:06.280]   well sorry sir yeah yeah it's a show you done I don't want to I was just gonna
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:12.160]   say in marketplaces but I already said that okay okay yeah so my take on it is
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.400]   you know I go back also to the the sort of data control issue and I think
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:22.520]   that you know if if we were to move more of the control to the end users and
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.400]   allow for the ability to take your data out and have it in a format that could
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.480]   actually be shifted to other services that would be powerful and so the easiest
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:35.120]   way to do that in my head and their arguments against this too is that you
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.080]   would put in place something that effectively says you have you know a
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:46.040]   way sort of get out of antitrust jail free card if you make your data available
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.040]   in that in that way and you have APIs that allow people to pull out their data
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.400]   and move it to other services and if you've done that and allowed people to
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.360]   get out and allowed other services to build on the data that is in your silo
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.680]   then you avoid antitrust and that would create incentives for those companies
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.960]   to free up that data to allow for competitors to come in to allow for new
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.720]   entrants to build off of the sort of network effects that are already built
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.320]   up around these companies and to create a more competitive environment and I
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:21.800]   would add one more data point two go ahead Jeff then you Stacy which and my
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.880]   these poor folks have heard me say this a million times I was on a transatlantic
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.480]   high-level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:32.440]   read regulation that came out with proposals that even I who sound like I'm
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.640]   all anti-regulation and not be when they're reasonable and and and the argument is
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:44.120]   transparency to accountability that you also say in an FTC kind of model if
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.840]   you're saying Facebook that you're going to have a friendly place that's safe for
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.640]   people then show us and give us give researchers the data we're going to
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:55.720]   require you to give them data so we can hold you accountable to that promise
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.320]   I can tell you what to promise but right hold you accountable to that and so we
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.520]   need data that way too and we need you to give it to us safely historically
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.640]   these companies have been very reluctant to give that up right that's why the
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.840]   government has to that's where the government has a role and and I got kicked
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:13.760]   into the table whatever I said this in this high-level working group is if I
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.640]   use the phrase save harbor they say no I say it's basically the same if the
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.640]   government forces me to give you the data and you really can't get mad at me
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.240]   if somebody else f set up so but you know require me to give you the data and
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.240]   then that's well how we'll give it to you I mean the risk the risk with that
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:35.080]   model though is then you're only held you know it's the way the FTC works
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.800]   today with privacy stuff you're only held to the promises that you make and
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:43.240]   that just creates incentives to make your promises broad so that you can't
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:49.480]   have violated your own promises right Europeans in this will will require some
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:55.320]   negotiation of what those promises are and that you have civil society and you
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:01.360]   have government regulation and you have right a couple together and so there
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:05.720]   yes there will be promises that would be unacceptable in that view Stacy
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.320]   right oh I was gonna go back yeah oh sorry I was gonna go back to Mike's point
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:17.640]   about data interoper not interoperability export mm-hmm I think it's a smart idea
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.920]   I think where we would start seeing the arguments kind of arise there is around
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.360]   what that format looks like because right now I can take my data out of
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:31.840]   lots of devices like it exported to like excel completely freaking useless
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:38.440]   right worse than you could use JSON or something you could have a
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:42.280]   standardized format that would be machine readable right so but then you have to
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:47.800]   think so a couple things there right one some like GDPR would get in the way of
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.680]   something like that because if I export my data then I can't control what happens
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.080]   like if if there's an eight if Google makes my data available to other
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.480]   companies via an API even if it's not personally identifiable something like GDPR
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.880]   comes in and says so so there's some I'm not saying it's a bad idea it's wrong
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.040]   I'm just trying to point up like if we do something like this here where some of
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.360]   the fault lines of fights are gonna happen yeah and and you're exactly right
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.320]   and that's actually why I've been really concerned about all the privacy
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.720]   regulations because I feel that they block off this path entirely trust and
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   and you know even though I'm supportive of privacy I worry that we actually
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.800]   block off this kind of situation which would lead to more competition you know
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.780]   there are ways to deal with all of that you know and I agree like right now you
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:37.020]   can export your data from various services but mostly in a useless format
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:42.780]   but part of that is because you can't really do that much with it if the law
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:46.680]   were made clear that you would be protected from antitrust if you had it
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:53.820]   in a way that you know really you know enabled it to be useful in other scenarios
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:59.980]   then there's an opportunity for for new companies to come in and say we'll give
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.500]   you a different interface to your Facebook data and we're not going to you
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:08.720]   know bombard you with with advertisements or things of that nature and you can
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.060]   have different models come about and whereas today thanks to things like CFAA
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:19.360]   Facebook can block a bunch of these things if we were to you know fix that
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.380]   aspect of it also you could you could set up the framework and the ecosystem in
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:27.280]   which there would be competition but you're right that it would conflict with
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.440]   other laws and those need to be dealt with.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:35.080]   But I'm all for it let's do it. Yeah yeah all right we've we've solved it.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.040]   Okay we can move on.
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:39.640]   Let's see what we can discuss. Fantastic good good good good good good good.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:45.640]   It was good. Now we can hear about Zoom Jopie.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:55.920]   How about if we do the Google change the Google change log.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:06.040]   So search day was the day after last week's episode and there was a lot of
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:13.120]   stuff but the only one that I even sticks in my mind was the fact that you
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:19.080]   could you can hum to your Google assistant now and they will be able to
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:22.400]   help you figure out. Is it distributed if you tried it? Is it out there?
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.880]   You want to try it? Let's see starting today you can hum whistle or sing a melody
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.640]   to Google to solve your earworm on your mobile device open the latest version of
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:34.840]   the Google app or find your Google search widget widget.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:37.160]   And type should I try it?
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.560]   Oh yeah. I don't know if I'm the best tumber.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:45.040]   How can you not stay well Stacey says she's got tone deaf so she can't.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.840]   I'm tone deaf I can't hum anything.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:49.800]   Okay. Well that seems like a good way to test it.
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:50.800]   Exactly.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.640]   Understand Stacey is talking to me for some reason.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.640]   All I did was open it.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.640]   Am I humming to?
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.640]   No, I'm going to hum.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.640]   Hold on.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640]   Hold on.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.640]   Then you can hum because I have a microphone.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.640]   Well, I guess you could do it too.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640]   That's okay.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640]   There's no rush for me to say.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]   You've been able to hear us all first Leo.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640]   I don't know.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:12.040]   My phone has gotten weird here.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.440]   Okay.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.800]   What's the command you use?
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.640]   What is this song?
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.880]   Wait a minute. Okay.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.240]   I can hear the song.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.240]   Big friend.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.240]   What song?
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.560]   Oh, I know Stacey's wedding song.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.760]   Oh yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.120]   What is this song?
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.120]   Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.960]   What is this song?
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:38.960]   Sorry.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.760]   There was a problem.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.400]   Yeah. What is this?
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.440]   Wait a minute. Take two.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]   What is this song?
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:51.080]   I don't have that information.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.760]   It is even waiting.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.680]   What is this song?
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:01.040]   Okay. Your turn Stacey.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.040]   Let's pick a...
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.320]   Well, is it part of an update that we need to have?
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.840]   Do we know we have to get it?
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.000]   It says today, open the latest version of the Google app.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.760]   Oh, maybe that was the assistant app.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:13.400]   Maybe I need to use the Google app.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.760]   This is part of the problem with Google.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.760]   Yes.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.760]   That's part of the problem with Google.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:19.800]   I have home.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.800]   I have...
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.920]   I don't have a Google.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.920]   What is this song?
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.920]   Sorry.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920]   I don't have that information.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.920]   What is that?
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920]   Try a different song, man.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.840]   Try a silent night.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:54.560]   You gotta go for 15 seconds.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:01.160]   It says it's either "No Che at the Pause, Hard Pill to Swallow, or Silent Night."
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.160]   There you go.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160]   Pretty good.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.200]   I wonder what No Che at the Pause sounds like.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:11.120]   Maybe it's the same song.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:17.120]   It sounds exactly the same.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.120]   Very different.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.080]   Your version at least.
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.080]   Okay.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.080]   I'll do one.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.080]   I'll do 15 seconds.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.080]   Is that it?
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.400]   You gotta go for 10 to 15 seconds.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.400]   What do I say?
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.400]   What is this song?
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.400]   Hey, Google, what's this song?
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:34.520]   Okay.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:39.960]   What is this song?
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.560]   I forgot.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:48.000]   Oh, you have to hum?
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.560]   This is too long.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:57.000]   I don't know anymore.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]   Okay.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.640]   I've limited value.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.160]   It seems like such a good idea.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.160]   This needs to be a clip that goes on Twitter.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.160]   Oh, God.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.160]   Don't say that, it will.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.880]   Wait, could you all recognize my song?
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:10.880]   No.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.680]   No, I don't know if this could fight song?
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.360]   It was all the single ladies.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.360]   Oh, I did not.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.800]   Put your hands up.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.560]   You are tone deaf.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.360]   I will actually grant you that now.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:23.360]   Let's see.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.080]   Mike, do you have an Android phone?
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.080]   I do.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:33.080]   But I am not doing this.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:39.680]   I've lost the thread.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.440]   I don't know how the rest of this goes.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.280]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.280]   Let me try it.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:47.280]   You do it.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:55.920]   Okay, Google, what's this song?
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:09.840]   I like how the little hair bops, it's like Amy.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.720]   The problem is 15 seconds is a really long time to have a song you don't know.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:14.720]   That is a...
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:15.880]   I mean, that's a significant.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.880]   I'm not going...
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   There's not going to be video of me doing this.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.880]   Anyone on earth?
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.040]   You're not tricking me into it?
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.040]   You're not catching me?
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:24.040]   Nope.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.040]   Nope.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.920]   I may not have much dignity, but I do have stuff that's not funny.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.920]   I need stress.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:30.920]   I'm left.
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.920]   Mars is long gone, Mike.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.920]   I'm not a long gone.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.600]   How many say ahead of the holidays are nice games you can play with people on Zoom?
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.520]   This is actually quite nice.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.760]   You can challenge your friends to hum songs and see if Google gets it.
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:44.760]   There you go.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:45.760]   There you go.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:46.760]   Oh, God, help me.
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:50.120]   It's going to be the next icebreaker on a Zoom meeting.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   No.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.120]   Everybody has to have icebreakers.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.600]   Did you get any icebreakers on Zoom meetings?
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.440]   No, it wasn't so long ago we had on a Google Change log.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.280]   This new app that Google was offering called Trusted Contacts.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:07.400]   Remember that would help you find a family member if they don't respond or they could
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:10.400]   proactively broadcast their location.
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.160]   Google's killing it already.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:14.440]   It's like less than a year.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:17.240]   It's going to discontinue Trusted Contacts.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.920]   It's yanked it from the Google Play Store.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:26.080]   If you want to use a similar feature, they say just use it in Maps.
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:32.280]   You want to hear Google's also killing or rather discontinuing its Nest Secure Hardware?
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.040]   Yeah, there is a big one.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.520]   They only offered that.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.600]   They never had a follow-up.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.360]   That was about what, four years, three years ago.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.640]   But they're just saying it's not going to work anymore.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.640]   That's it.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   Bum, Don.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.440]   No, no.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.440]   They're saying if you have it, it will continue to work.
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:49.440]   They're supporting it.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.440]   It will continue to work.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.440]   Well, for how long?
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.440]   But they're no longer selling.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440]   Well, yeah.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.440]   You know, that's the question.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:55.440]   How long are they going to run the server?
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440]   This is the...
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440]   It had a little keypad.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.440]   It had sensors.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:02.200]   Yeah, the lots of those sensors is sad.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:06.720]   But I'm hoping that with the connected home over IP, we'll get sensors that actually
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.480]   will work with everybody.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.120]   We should have a Google Change log and a Google Kill log.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.120]   Google Death.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:23.400]   You now have a heart button on Google Discover.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.600]   I don't even know what Google Discover is.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.760]   What's Google Discover?
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.000]   No idea.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.160]   For adjusting feed preferences.
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.720]   Oh, that's the swipe right.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.680]   Oh, is that our newspaper thing in the link on your phone?
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.680]   Oh.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.640]   I turn the iPhone right away.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.640]   I should use that.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:42.640]   Yeah, I turn it on immediately.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:43.640]   Oh, yeah, I do too.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:44.640]   Oh, really?
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.640]   Okay.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640]   I think it's fun.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:53.760]   So if you heart these, before it had a more or less slider, remember that?
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.920]   Now you can heart it.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.920]   It doesn't open a menu.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920]   It just says, "I like it.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.080]   I like it, Google."
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:59.560]   I see it more or less.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.560]   Ooh, Chromebook.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.560]   Yeah, I know.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.560]   It's not there.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.560]   We're placing that more or less.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.560]   See, that's the little slider.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.560]   Right.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.560]   They're replacing that with a heart.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:07.560]   Oh.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560]   So you can't say less, I guess.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:09.560]   Well, that's not bad.
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.200]   No, you tell it to...
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:13.000]   You can say hide the story.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000]   I'm not interested in the stuff.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.880]   That's under the three-dot menu still.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.880]   Okay.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:19.880]   Wait, so what...
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:20.880]   I'm lost.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.880]   What is this even?
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:22.880]   What are we talking about?
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   So here's...
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.880]   Here's...
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:25.880]   Here's like discovery.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:26.880]   It's Google News product.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:27.880]   So yeah, if you...
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:30.040]   I don't think it's news, but I don't have that.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.320]   If you go to a story on news...
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.440]   That basically goes to Google News.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.440]   It goes to Google News.
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.480]   It's just for fun.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:42.360]   So you can see that I like IoT devices, modern architecture, advice columns.
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.360]   And...
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   Right.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:48.400]   So you can start selling arms for its Robodox Sport Spot mixture, which scared the Bejesus
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.400]   arms.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.400]   Oh, you mean arms.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.400]   Because I was thinking, "Guds."
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.400]   But it's actually...
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   No, just arms.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.400]   Okay.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.400]   But yeah.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   So, and I like this tool because it'll sometimes surface some really weird stuff that I would
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.640]   never have found otherwise.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.640]   Good.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:05.640]   Yeah, I mean, I get that with Google News, but this is different than Google News.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640]   I'm seeing...
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640]   I don't see any of you.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.640]   This is the...
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.640]   It's a little bit different, yeah.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.200]   You have the Pixel launcher and you swipe to the right, right?
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.200]   There's a whole screen of stuff on the...
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]   All left there.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.600]   Is this only on the Pixel then?
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.600]   Only if you use a Pixel launcher, yeah.
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.120]   If you use the Pixel launcher on other apps.
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.120]   I have the OnePlus, which...
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.120]   Yeah, you don't have the Pixel launcher.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.240]   Yeah, you don't have the same thing.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.880]   Actually, Jeff, you'll like this, some new features in Chrome OS.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.440]   Google is adding screen recording.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:42.040]   There are third party tools, but now they'll be...
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.840]   Oh, that's great.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.320]   My daughter, when she was playing Star Stable, she could have been recording her games and
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:48.320]   broadcast it.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.320]   Yes, exactly.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.320]   Well, you can't...
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.800]   But then how would she become a spy?
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.040]   I think that's true.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.920]   Yeah, well, it's just her screen though, right?
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:57.280]   It's a screen shot and it's not live.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.000]   It's just recorded and then you could then upload it if you wanted to.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   Okay.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.280]   And I know this actually isn't the change on it because it's not a Google thing, but
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:10.720]   Parallels has just announced that they are going to add Windows virtualization to Chromebooks.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.680]   So you'll be able to run Windows apps in your Chrome.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.920]   Why would I ever want to do that?
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.920]   Well, I know.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.840]   So we'd have to work.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:24.640]   It's interesting how Chrome OS is becoming more like a general purpose operating system.
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.600]   Initially, it's only for enterprise Chromebooks, so you have to have a managed Chromebook and
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.640]   it does require a lot of hardware.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.440]   You have to have 16 gigs of RAM and i5 or better and 100.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:38.720]   Well, I know it's not a lot of Chromebooks can run this.
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:45.840]   And speaking about Chromebooks, Kevin has just got the Acer Chromebooks been 513 with the
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:48.240]   Qualcomm 7C, is that a big deal?
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.240]   That's only $399.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.760]   Yeah, it's that Qualcomm.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:53.320]   I'm not so happy about it.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.440]   So Kevin has it.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:58.800]   You should ask him offline because I think he can't talk about some of it, but he's able
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.040]   to talk about others.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.040]   Okay.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.040]   Okay.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:08.680]   And I think it's in conjunction with Google's that this will come to all Chrome.
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:12.760]   Chromebooks with sufficient horsepower in the next few months.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:14.480]   So yeah, you know what?
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.600]   It's really it's for one.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.760]   There's that one Windows app is the only thing keeping you from using a Chromebook and now
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.760]   you'll be able to run it.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.400]   And I think that's actually a good thing.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.840]   And if you need to, you can put in, Kevin would tell you to put in Linux and do videos
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:28.840]   that way.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:33.360]   But if you're chicken, you put in Windows and you do something that way.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.480]   Here's a little friend you can run around with your spot dog with arms.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.480]   It's a little crop watching.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.560]   I'll jump ahead here.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:44.280]   This is, let me see if I turn off the sound.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.240]   I see if I can find a video of it.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.720]   It's a robot that rolls around in your fields and watches your crops.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.720]   Oh, I do that.
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:56.640]   You need that, Jeff, for your crop.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.640]   Back 40.
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.640]   There it is.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:51:59.640]   There it is.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.640]   Project mineral.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.640]   It's a plant buggy.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.800]   Didn't we talk about this?
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.280]   It looks like the things from Sean?
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:05.280]   I feel like we did.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.280]   Maybe you talked about it last week.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280]   Okay, never mind.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:11.320]   Google chat will go free next year.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.280]   Hangouts will lose chat.
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.280]   Stick it.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.280]   Never get this.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:16.280]   Jesus Christ.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:25.120]   So, yeah, it's basically they're going to continue to dismember hangouts to provide features
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.320]   to other programs.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.840]   And I'm totally reliant on hangouts.
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:29.840]   I don't know what this means for-
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.840]   Yeah, so we're Kevin and I.
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:35.200]   Well, and if you're a Fi customer, hangouts is your messaging platform.
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.800]   I don't know.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:38.800]   I think they have-
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.640]   None of this makes sense.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:47.040]   It hasn't, there's been no clear explanation of any of this for the past decade, right?
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.440]   I mean, it's just like the absence of the change.
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.440]   It's crazy.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.440]   So, what is-
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:55.520]   I imagine teams of engineers at Google who work on each different part of something, and
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.880]   like maybe once a month they get together and they do like a battle bot style thing.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880]   And if you're-
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.880]   I don't know.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.880]   When your feature takes over the other features.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.880]   I think it's a link.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:07.880]   Dance off.
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:08.880]   Dance off.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.560]   Ooh, that'd be way better.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.560]   If you-
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:12.960]   There's a really good story that I think Jeff would like.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:13.960]   Okay.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.960]   Fire away.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:15.960]   Ooh.
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:20.080]   In the display section, and I'm wondering if this is indicative of things to-
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:23.400]   Remember we're in the change log right now.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:24.840]   This is a Google display.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:25.840]   Okay.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.840]   Does that not go in the change log?
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.840]   That goes in there.
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:28.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:29.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.840]   I just was warning you.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.840]   It was just a warning.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:32.840]   Okay.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.840]   You don't want to pee-
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:39.360]   Several features coming, but the one I thought you'd care about is if you have personal and
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:43.840]   separate personal and work accounts, you can set up multiple accounts on Google Assistant
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.600]   devices to see and interact with all of your upcoming events.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.600]   Ooh.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.600]   Finally.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:52.320]   Does that mean G Suite?
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320]   Maybe.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:58.840]   It works with Google Workspaces, which I think is Workspace is going to be G Suite.
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:59.840]   What?
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:00.840]   Yeah, G Suite's been renamed.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:01.840]   Yeah, it's been renamed.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:02.840]   Okay.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.480]   So this is your- so you can get your Autoscalate G Suite because that's what I think of it
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.480]   as.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.480]   Your G Suite account now will- you can sign up to test the beta so your calendar and stuff
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:15.800]   will appear on your Google displays.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:17.560]   So it's the beginning of possible-
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.920]   A little baby- baby toe moved closer to the line.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:22.920]   Yes.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.360]   Dude, don't complain, man.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:28.600]   This is going to make you happy, Jeff, because you still have a Pixel 4.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:32.840]   You may remember they talk about Google Pixel 5's portrait light feature.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.560]   I actually have a 3.
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:41.200]   They're going to roll it out to the 2s, the 3, and the 4, and the 4a.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.920]   I think this is one of the things Google does well because a lot of the features of their
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.680]   cameras really are software and not hardware.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:53.040]   So portrait light, which allows you to dynamically tweak and edit lighting brightness around the
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.040]   faces and the lighting angle.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.800]   That was the one where you could have the light come from different positions on the
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:54:59.800]   portrait.
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:00.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.600]   That's all software based, so older phones should be able to do it and it will be available
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.400]   soon, if not already.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.200]   To your Pixel 3.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:18.360]   Finally, you now can ask Google to find voting locations and ballot boxes where you can
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.480]   drop off your ballot.
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.080]   I bet you you have all voted already.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.160]   Is it a vote yet?
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.160]   I did.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:28.600]   And I heard it in my ballot.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:34.440]   You live in Texas where you had to go, "Oh, you don't live in Texas anymore."
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:35.440]   So that made a lot of use.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.800]   No, if I lived in Texas, I would have early voted.
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.280]   But Washington, when I got here, I was like, "Oh my God, is this voting?"
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:45.360]   I don't think you can vote in person in Washington.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.360]   I don't know.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.360]   It's awesome.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:52.120]   Every New Jersey, the governor decided to send mail balance to everybody in the state.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:56.800]   If you vote in person on Election Day, you are a provisional ballot.
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:57.800]   Oh, interesting.
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:58.800]   Oh, whoa.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:00.320]   So, have you sent your ballot in, Jeff?
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.320]   Are you going to...
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:04.520]   Oh, I took it into the city hall and in the box and put it in there.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.520]   I mailed.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:08.520]   I trusted the US mail because I thought about it and I thought I could drop it off in an
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:12.760]   unattended locked box right out in the parking lot of the Veterans Hall.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:17.520]   Or I could put it in a nicely marked secure US mailbox.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.200]   So I did that.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.840]   And what was nice is in California, we get a text message saying that post office has
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.280]   received your ballot.
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.240]   The post office is sending the ballot to us.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.600]   And I just got a text yesterday.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.160]   We have received your ballot and it will be counted.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.800]   So that was a nice feeling.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:34.800]   Mike, are you...
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.000]   Mike, are you voting?
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.280]   I have sitting on my desk in front of me.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.600]   I have the ballot filled out.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:41.880]   I just have not brought it.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.680]   I'm going to bring it down to one of the election boxes.
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:47.800]   There's like six of them within a mile.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:50.320]   So you'll appreciate this feature.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.000]   You can now ask the Google ballot drop boxes near me.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.920]   And it'll show you all the ones and it'll show you the one in the nearest.
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:59.280]   There's early voting locations.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.960]   They will show you as well.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:05.440]   And Google says soon you'll be able to say, "Hey, you know who?
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:06.440]   Where do I vote?
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.520]   Where do I vote?"
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.520]   So that's good.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:11.960]   You know what would be nice is if they showed you how many people were in line.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.960]   So you can go with like...
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.960]   Oh, that would be great.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:15.960]   That would be cool.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:17.760]   Leo, I used the draw.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:19.240]   I dropped box over at the veteran center.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.240]   It looks pretty safe.
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.440]   It's locked down in a couple of days later I got this.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.440]   Oh, nice.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.440]   You got a little button.
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.440]   So I got the email.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.440]   I can tell me that the...
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:29.440]   My vote will be...
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:30.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:31.440]   How did you get that?
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:32.440]   Email?
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.960]   You got an emailed picture that says of a button that says I voted.
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.960]   Okay.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:38.960]   I do miss not having my...
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:39.960]   I thought it was up there.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.960]   I'll probably get that too then, I guess.
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:42.960]   No, I was joking.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.960]   I was joking.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.840]   I just thought, you know what, why not mail it?
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.640]   I got the post office.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.640]   And I know my...
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.160]   I just think we should support your local postal service.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:54.960]   I mean, mine came with the...
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:55.960]   Yeah, I have a sticker.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:57.960]   Oh, but your sticker is bigger.
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:58.960]   Yours is like John's.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:57:59.960]   Mine's just that little...
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:00.960]   That just little...
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:01.960]   That little...
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.960]   That little...
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   I have a sticker.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.960]   What's my ballot?
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:05.960]   You think I have a sticker?
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.960]   Well, it came with mine.
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.960]   It's county...
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:09.960]   It's county by county.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.520]   County by county.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:19.960]   If you are a Stadia gamer or you want to be, Google has launched free game demos to entice
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.720]   people into cloud gaming.
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:27.200]   They started yesterday, including Pac-Man mega tunnel battle.
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.840]   All you have to do is click a link, create a Stadia account, and start playing the game
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.560]   streamed from the servers.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.480]   So this is a chance for you to just try Stadia, you know, right now.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.520]   Because nobody else is using it, apparently.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:44.800]   I was about to say, don't go try a Luna.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.800]   That's no fun.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:46.800]   Try Stadia.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.680]   The other also ran gaming, cloud gaming platform.
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:51.920]   So I'm going to choose my account.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.400]   Let me see if we can play...
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.040]   Use Google Chrome to play Stadia on computers.
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:57.880]   Oh, you see?
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:01.680]   They are monopoly.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.600]   I can't play it in my Firefox.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.600]   That's...
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:06.600]   Of course I could play...
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:09.080]   It would work fine in Firefox.
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:13.120]   Unlike Apple, where you can't watch their events unless you're using Safari.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.640]   Oh, yeah, same thing.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.800]   I think they stopped doing that, by the way.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:18.520]   I think they've opened up.
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:26.800]   And that, unless you have something else, is the Google change log.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:29.040]   I didn't know whether to put this in the change log or not.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.880]   I don't think it belongs in the change log.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.880]   I mentioned that AOC was playing this new game among us on Twitch.
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:39.880]   100,000 people joined her and Elon Omar playing a...
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:40.880]   It's a fun game.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:42.280]   It's like "Wear Wolf".
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:43.280]   You're on a spaceship.
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:44.960]   Everybody has a different role.
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:46.320]   There are one or more impostors.
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.840]   You have to find the impostors before they kill you off.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:49.840]   You play...
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:50.840]   Sounds like you played it, Mike.
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.320]   I have not, but my son has.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:56.000]   And in fact, I think this is very second in the next room over here.
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000]   He's playing among us.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000]   Yes.
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.520]   Well, this is what the Taylor Lawrence article was really interesting because she said basically
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:08.600]   this is how kids your son's age are socializing in COVID-19.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:09.600]   Yes.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:10.600]   Because it's not really...
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:12.080]   The game isn't that engaging.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.800]   It's more like you're sitting and talking.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:18.040]   It's like when guys get together and play poker, it's just the backbone for the actual
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:19.200]   socializing.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.960]   So I think that's kind of cool.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.960]   AOC...
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.080]   I'll have to show my daughter.
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:25.680]   Yeah, I think she probably already knows about him, Mom.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:26.680]   Well, yeah.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.680]   Okay, I should have...
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:29.880]   I should have checked in with her and see if that's something she's doing.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:31.120]   Say, do you know about among us?
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:32.120]   I wonder.
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:37.480]   You know, because these things, they spread kind of virally, right?
[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:40.840]   So maybe that they just hasn't hit the island yet.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:42.920]   Here's that Taylor Lawrence's article.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.320]   Everyone's playing among us.
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:47.280]   YouTubers, influencers and streamers, popularized.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.280]   This...
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:50.640]   Taylor was so happy to see she tweeted today.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:53.840]   And yeah, after I wrote the article AOC, used it.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.120]   Half a million people joined her.
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:57.320]   You play these characters.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:02.520]   It's a multiplayer game, four to ten players dropped onto an alien spaceship.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.880]   You're either a crewmate or an imposter.
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:08.720]   You have to run around the ship trying to complete a set of tasks while not getting
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.960]   killed by the impostors.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:16.120]   Very big in the early teen set.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.120]   This is actually kind of a funny one.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:21.760]   Here, I'll play this.
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.320]   Did I mute my sound?
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.720]   Give me a second.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:26.320]   I need to go, Mom.
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.080]   Let me start it over again.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.840]   That's the sound of running.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.160]   Give me a second.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.520]   He says, that's familiar.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.240]   My friends are in the bathroom.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:38.320]   I can't play too much of it.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.480]   Okay, that's just a little something.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.120]   You can see whether or not Google knows what that tune is though.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.520]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:51.160]   The Biden campaign is pretty savvy when it comes to another game called Animal Crossing.
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:54.240]   I just started playing Animal Crossing.
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.120]   It's a fun game on the Nintendo Switch.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.120]   You liberal you.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.120]   No, I love it.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:01.640]   They had Biden Harris yard signs that you could buy.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.920]   Now they have a whole island.
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.160]   So the idea is you're on an island.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.360]   You're building up your island over time.
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:12.400]   You're doing a, it's a lot of work, but apparently, I don't know, somebody in the Biden campaign
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:18.880]   really has a lot of free time because they've built a rather elaborate island featuring
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.480]   Kamala Harris is upstairs.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:22.160]   The Biden headquarters.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:28.760]   They say there are plenty of ice cream trains, aviators, chucks, swag and more.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:34.800]   And of course, a lot of information about how to vote as an election day checklist.
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:41.560]   That's, you know, it's in 2016, one of the secrets people said to Trump's success was
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:45.800]   his masterful use of social media, particularly Facebook.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:51.160]   It's interesting that Democrats are, I don't see Donald Trump playing Animal Crossing anytime
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:52.120]   soon.
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.400]   That's pretty cool.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:01.080]   You can, you can get a Biden island themed shirt for your character.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:02.080]   The dream code.
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.480]   Well, you just search for it.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:08.240]   So you can join, join them on the island if you wish.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.240]   Zoomtopia.
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:10.240]   Zoomtopia.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.240]   What is zoomtopia?
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:12.240]   Zoomtopia.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.320]   A day if you understand things.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:15.320]   I think it's worth it.
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:16.320]   Is it their conference?
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.320]   They're big conferences.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:18.320]   Yes, it was their conference or online.
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:20.840]   They are now doing end to end encryption.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:27.600]   It is available as an option for both free and paid accounts and judging by the description,
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.400]   we talked about it yesterday in security now.
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.760]   It's being done right.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:37.720]   So if you want an encrypted meeting, which you probably don't need to do for your, you
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:40.920]   know, your, your, I don't know, maybe you do for all.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.920]   Jeffrey, Jeffrey, maybe.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.320]   Jeffrey, let me push back on that and say why you would, even if you're not nervous about
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.720]   it, which is that if you only do it when you're nervous about what you're doing, you're
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.320]   kind of sickling to people that these are the times to check in.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.600]   Here I am doing something bad.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:57.960]   Like burner phones is the guardian word.
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:58.960]   Yes.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:01.080]   That's cool that they are offering that.
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:06.240]   I think you lose some capabilities with encryption, but nevertheless, it is, it is available.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:10.120]   It also supports the idea of encryption and makes people say don't take it away from
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:11.120]   us.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.120]   That's right.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.120]   Right.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.120]   Which they're about to try to do, I believe.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:15.120]   I'm going to keep trying.
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.120]   They will try forever.
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:22.920]   There's zaps, which you can open apps in the room and share those apps as you do the,
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.920]   which I think would be neat.
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.320]   Like Dropbox and Slack.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.120]   Like, what is it?
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:29.120]   Mm, Bob.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.120]   Was that mm?
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:31.120]   Mm hmm.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:33.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.840]   So basically, I mean, Zoom is just saying, Hey, we're going to be a platform.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.920]   So you can put all sorts of weird stuff on us and open stuff from us.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.400]   So like, I don't know if that's good news or bad news for him.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.760]   I guess it depends on how they implement it.
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:45.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:51.320]   Then there's on Zoom, which is their online events platform with more functionality for
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:54.600]   events because people are going to other platforms for large scale events.
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.000]   Ah, my way to one.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.240]   Which one do you like, Stacy?
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.680]   No, I use hop in instead of zoom because it allows you to do networking and chat and
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:06.920]   all sorts of great things.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:07.920]   Yeah.
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.720]   The one, the one I use is called Remo, which I think is fantastic for online events.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:13.720]   Remo?
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.720]   Yeah, it's, yeah, Remo.co.
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.720]   It's similar to hop in.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:20.320]   Like I was going back and forth between hop in and Remo and Remo just had some features
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:21.680]   that I really liked.
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:28.040]   But yeah, it's interesting that like, you know, I spent a few weeks researching this
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.920]   space and it is incredible.
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:33.160]   There are so many different virtual events companies out there.
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:37.800]   And like I found, I think three or four top 10 lists that had no overlap between all
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:38.800]   four top 10.
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:39.800]   Jesus.
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:42.800]   So there's all these different companies.
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:47.400]   It has like 45 different companies on them.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:48.400]   And they, yeah.
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.280]   And everyone is still is doing zoom or God forbid teams.
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:54.480]   Did you see CES is going to be hosted on teams?
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.480]   Oh, oh, really?
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:56.480]   Let us all just cry.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:57.480]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:58.960]   Must have been a deal with Microsoft.
[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:01.160]   Have you guys tried Wondermead?
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:02.160]   You know that one?
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:03.520]   I have these teams.
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:04.800]   So I was at a Google event.
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.440]   It was the, because the social things, they have avatars.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:08.600]   I hate those.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:12.720]   But now you're little videos and you come near someone and then you see the other person
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:15.480]   video in your video there and you can talk and three other people can come down and
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.280]   you're all in videos and you can talk.
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.280]   Right?
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:24.160]   There's a thing like students being able to mingle and means and things.
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.440]   I desperately need that kind of thing.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.320]   So is there, what other competitors are out there?
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:31.720]   The one that's similar to that is called Gather Town.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:35.640]   And it has sort of like, it feels like a kind of eight bit computer type thing.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:39.720]   But as you walk around, as you get closer to people, the videos of the people that you're
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:43.920]   closer to expand and you can talk to them and you can wander around the room.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:45.040]   So yeah, check out Gather Town.
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:49.840]   I wonder how much of the explosion of these technologies has to do with WebRTC, which
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:52.160]   was, I think, a Google technology.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:56.800]   The ability for a browser to do all of these things that normally you'd write a standalone
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.440]   application to do.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:02.200]   Zoom doesn't use it, but Google Meet, I'm sure, does.
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:06.560]   And a lot of these technologies, we have a JITC server, which is an open source solution.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.200]   It uses WebRTC.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:11.040]   It makes it much easier to implement this kind of conferencing.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.360]   I bet you that's why there's so many different platforms.
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:22.080]   So the last thing from Zoomtopia that I found interesting was a suite of things for the
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:25.800]   hybrid office and hybrid workforce.
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:31.160]   So a virtual receptionist, so you fire the receptionist.
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:33.840]   Zoom rooms scheduling display people counting.
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:37.920]   So if there's a limit to how many people you can have in a room, what we'll come to is
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:40.520]   we'll start counting people.
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:44.560]   Voice commands for Zoom rooms, so you don't have to touch anything.
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:47.040]   Native integration of Alexa for business on Zoom rooms.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.520]   I don't know what that means.
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:52.400]   Control Zoom rooms from a mobile device or laptop.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.360]   Zoom rooms enhanced dashboard reporting.
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:57.560]   So it's all this stuff for the new office.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:58.560]   Why?
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:02.000]   So the receptionist, you come into an office and there's nobody there.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.360]   There's just a screen.
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:07.520]   And the receptionist is at home and welcomes you.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.840]   And says, well, just sit down.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:11.120]   Somebody will Zoom you in a minute.
[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:15.120]   I mean, I don't, it's like just lock the place up.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.120]   Yep.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:21.720]   I, you know, some of this feels like the, the, the Zoom and others are assuming this is
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:22.720]   not going to end.
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:24.880]   And this is the future of work.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:26.760]   This is what workplaces are going to look like.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:27.760]   Yep.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.760]   Yep.
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:29.760]   That's exactly what's happening here.
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:30.760]   I think it's, I mean, I think it's exactly what's happening.
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:34.600]   So that's why I was, that's why I was interested in this because they're, they're anticipating
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:37.360]   some return to work, but they're basically anticipating we're going to, we're going
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.840]   to add in more and more features because we're going to be doing more and more virtually.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:45.360]   Well, a lot of companies are going, are following the Twitter route, Microsoft, Dropbox saying,
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:49.000]   you know, you, you, this may be, this may be the new normal.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.480]   This may be how we work from now on.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.120]   So I had to go into Manhattan for the first time.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:54.120]   I had to go pick up books.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:57.040]   I will fashion up my office.
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.960]   I went in for the first time since March 12th.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:08:59.960]   Wow.
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:00.960]   And what was it like?
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:02.960]   Well, the city was crowded again.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:06.280]   I mean, there were people, it wasn't, their traffic wasn't bad, but there were people around
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:07.800]   on the streets and stuff.
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:12.280]   But I go into my school and I have to do the, you know, the fill in the form and say I have
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:13.960]   not sick and all that stuff.
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:18.200]   I had to watch a video, explain what COVID was.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.440]   And then I go up to my office that we have two stories of this building and there's one
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.880]   guard and he's happy to see a human being.
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:29.840]   He's a wonderful social guy, Jermaine.
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.720]   And you know, he was just happy to see somebody and we chat for a few minutes and make sure
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:34.720]   everybody's okay.
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:37.800]   And I go upstairs and there's a sticker on my door that basically was like a holiday
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:40.000]   in toilet, sanitized for your protection.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.120]   Holy cow.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:47.840]   And the two tiniest little alcohol wipes I've ever seen in my life, they're available
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.080]   on my desk, I guess to do the phone or whatever.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.840]   And I pick up my books and I go and I leave and that was that.
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:56.040]   It was weird.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:00.080]   And so I used to commute, you know, every damn day to the city, I didn't drive into the
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:05.080]   city, I drove to Jersey City and from the past train, but it was an hour and 45 each
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.920]   way and I've gained all that life.
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:10.280]   And I just kind of can't imagine doing that again.
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:12.200]   A lot of conferences going virtual.
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:15.840]   You mentioned teams will be used by CES in January.
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:22.560]   VidCon is going to be virtual not only this year, but next year, Jim Latterback, our good
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:29.040]   friend who's the director of VidCon says this summer, 2021.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:35.560]   VidCon will be via Zoom and there'll be sessions all year round now.
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:43.880]   Nearly one million people tuned into digital events held by VidCon over the last few months.
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.600]   You're a big VidCon fan because it's chase chances even the up and coming YouTube stars.
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:50.200]   I'm a member of the industry advisory board.
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:51.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.240]   I'll leave you to disclose there because I don't get anything for it, but I'm a stream
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:55.800]   of the advisory.
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.680]   VidCon now, which includes speakers and experts from YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, TikTok and
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:03.560]   more will pick up again on October 27.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.920]   I'm going to all kinds of academic conferences.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:08.160]   I couldn't go too otherwise now.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.720]   Yeah, I don't think it's so bad.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:12.320]   Yeah, no, it's not.
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:13.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.960]   As long as you remember that they're happening, that's my big challenges.
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.560]   They're my calendar, exactly.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:22.720]   But this is why I'm going to have someone person who's going to be Australian in time.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.320]   So I'm not going to do that.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.760]   And according to the Journal of the American Planning Association, all these people who
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:39.040]   don't have to work in the office anymore are creating Zoom towns all over the West.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:43.640]   And it's kind of an interesting situation because so many people are working from home.
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.760]   They're moving out of the big expensive community.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:47.360]   I live in a Zoom town.
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.640]   You live in a Zoom town?
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:49.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:52.280]   Oh, 100%.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:57.040]   They tend to be small towns near major public lands and ski resorts.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:00.600]   Olympic Peninsula, baby.
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:07.440]   Sandpoint, Idaho, which is on a lake near a popular ski resort, had already begun to
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.480]   see an increased migration over the last decade.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:13.120]   But even more people are starting to arrive.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:20.480]   And I can tell you here in Petaluma, all the houses snapped up because we're kind of in
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:25.200]   an excerpt and a lot of houses are coming on the market all of a sudden because people
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:29.480]   have lived here for years saying, finally, I can dump this place and move back to New
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.480]   York City.
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:32.480]   Same here.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:33.480]   Wow.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:41.280]   So if each of you, if you could go to a different country and still work because it's fine,
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:46.000]   because we're all virtual, what country would you pick?
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:53.800]   Okay, my heart loves Helsinki, but I am aware that so that is in Finland.
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:54.800]   No.
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.800]   Yeah.
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:57.800]   I was like, no, yes.
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.480]   It's part of my, I went, when I went, I went to like all the Scandinavian countries.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:03.120]   So I'm a little confused from.
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:04.120]   Love Scandinavia.
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:05.120]   Love.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.920]   But it is really dark in cold in the winter.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:13.000]   So I'm not 100% sure I could, I could hack that yearboat.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000]   I want to.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.880]   I would go ahead, Mike.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:19.760]   I was going to say, Portugal.
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:20.760]   Portugal's very affordable.
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:25.320]   There are very lovely place, lovely people.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:27.920]   And your porcheese is good?
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:33.000]   No, but I could work on it.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.920]   I want to buy Trey Radcliffe's house.
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:39.720]   He's selling his house in Queen's, Queenstown, New Zealand.
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:41.440]   And it's gorgeous.
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:42.680]   I'm sure I can't afford it.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:44.120]   I can't believe how gorgeous it is.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.000]   They don't let foreigners buy houses in New Zealand.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000]   I bet not.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.600]   That's one of the reasons it's best place to go.
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.040]   That only you traveled to New Zealand.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:53.200]   You can't even go there.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:54.960]   Well, can you go to Portugal?
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:55.960]   Oh, no.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:56.960]   No.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.960]   No.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:58.960]   Can't go anywhere.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:13:59.960]   Yeah, pretty soon I think.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:03.440]   Barbados is offering a year-long visa for people who want to.
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:04.440]   Yeah, there's a few of those.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:05.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.840]   All of the Caribbean and Tigua, a lot of places in Caribbean have special.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:11.840]   So there was a great video.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:13.800]   Iceland, Iceland is going to open up for tourists.
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.240]   They're doing the testing, the rolling stuff.
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.440]   So CBS had an interview with the prime minister who's wonderful.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.080]   She's a young, brilliant woman.
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:24.440]   And the middle of the interview, or no, sorry, Washington Post was, in the middle of the
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:26.320]   interview with the earthquake hits.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:27.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:29.080]   And she continues with a plumb.
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:30.560]   She's like, oh, my God.
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.680]   There was a-- no, and everything's fine in Iceland.
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.680]   And we got those once in a while.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.680]   OK.
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:35.680]   You just woke up as a tourist.
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:36.680]   It's fine.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:38.440]   Normally they would tell us to go under the desk.
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:39.440]   But it was not that big.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:40.440]   So I'm still here talking to you.
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.040]   It's a little shaker.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.040]   We're like that here.
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.800]   We're like that here.
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:46.600]   All right.
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:52.200]   I think we've done enough damage to the podcast sphere for the moment.
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.280]   Let's get ready for our picks of the week coming up next.
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.320]   Mike, did they tell you we do picks of the week at the end of the show?
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.800]   They had told me last time I was on.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:03.880]   They didn't warn me.
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:05.320]   But I'll grab something off my desk.
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:06.320]   I'll give you a little time.
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:12.440]   Grab something off your desk while Stacey Higginbotham gives us her thing of the week.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:13.440]   Today's thing.
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:15.680]   She's grabbing something off her desk.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.200]   Oh, I recognize that.
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:19.040]   Oh, you got it.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.120]   Echo dot mid clock.
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:23.840]   Move it to the right a little tiny bit there.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.480]   Oh, there we go.
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:26.840]   I was like a kid running the left.
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:27.840]   There you go.
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:28.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:29.840]   Oh, that's pretty.
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:31.320]   It looks like a sphere.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.240]   It is a sphere.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.560]   And it is-- let's hear.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.920]   I'll put a-- this is a can of something for a reference.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:39.920]   This is the dot.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:40.920]   This is--
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:41.920]   There's your topo logo.
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:43.560]   OK, yeah.
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:45.800]   This is actually my local talking rain.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:49.960]   Ooh, talking rain.
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:52.640]   The one thing I don't like-- well, there's two things I don't like.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:54.840]   One, I was worried that these were going to be too bright.
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:56.240]   They are not too bright.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:58.840]   But they are also not very large.
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:02.600]   And this sits across my room.
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:03.600]   So I can't see it.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:04.600]   I have-- yeah.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:05.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.600]   So that's a bummer.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.760]   The other thing I don't like is I don't like the top here where this is--
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:10.760]   This looks like blemish.
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:12.000]   It's ugly.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.880]   And it's a hard plastic.
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:16.400]   It's not like the stuff.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:17.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.120]   I don't love this.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:20.120]   How much was it?
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:21.960]   So here's my--
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:24.760]   This is 459.99.
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:26.760]   How's the sound?
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:27.800]   OK, this is the dot.
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:29.000]   This is a tiny one.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.400]   I don't love the sound.
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:35.160]   And I can't talk about any of the others, because I'm under Barco.
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:36.880]   But next week, maybe I'll tell.
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:39.720]   Yes, because there are other, better sound--
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:40.720]   There are other--
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:42.440]   The-- yeah.
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:45.640]   The dot and the this are available now.
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.840]   I also would tell everybody, because it would be remiss of me not to.
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.880]   There's a brand new June of and out.
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:52.880]   Ah!
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:53.880]   Another one.
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:58.520]   Oh, brand new one in mine is about-- it's not about to die, but it's kind of like suffering
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:16:59.520]   a little.
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:00.520]   So I am excited.
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:01.520]   You had it for what?
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:02.520]   I will be buying the next one.
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:03.520]   A year?
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:04.520]   I've had it for four and a half years.
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:05.520]   Oh, wow.
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:09.200]   I've used it two to three times a day every single day.
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:10.200]   Well, you--
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:11.200]   So--
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:12.200]   You need a new one.
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:14.040]   It's worn out.
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:17.120]   So that is available to you for pre-order.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.600]   The fancy, schmancy version comes with all the tools you need to do things like cook a
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:26.160]   pizza, firewood-fired pizza, except not wood-fired.
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:29.120]   And other things, that's $9.99.
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:32.720]   And then there is a less fancy version that is $7.99.
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.560]   And then the normal version, which is just the oven without all the fancy trays and stuff
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:38.840]   that you need to use for things like air frying.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:44.080]   And that is probably $5.99.
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:46.920]   The fancier you go, the sooner it will ship.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:54.400]   And then the other thing to note is they have a new cooking thing that I guess you have
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:55.840]   to have the right kind of tray in.
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:57.720]   So it's kind of fancy.
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:17:58.920]   Like you may have to do the fancy one.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:00.840]   I need to talk to June to figure this out.
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:05.480]   But they're doing a rotisserie mode because they realize they can control the carbon heating
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:06.480]   elements.
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:07.480]   And just like--
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:08.480]   It's hot.
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:09.480]   Now they're--
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:10.480]   Don't rotate the chicken.
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:11.480]   Rotate the heat.
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:12.480]   The heat.
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:13.480]   Isn't that great?
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:15.360]   I'm like-- those are the kind of like mental things.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.240]   You're like, oh crap, it's soft.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:18.560]   Where I can do this.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.560]   That's really cool.
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.920]   So anyway, that's my two things.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.560]   I helped you out there, Mike.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:26.040]   Wow, I really like that.
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:27.040]   Wow.
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:28.040]   Mike--
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:29.040]   He's like, oh.
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.520]   Mike thing is just a blatant plug for my son.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.200]   He's become a drone pilot.
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:39.440]   He's on Instagram, Hank LePorte, and there's a few of his videos up there.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:41.600]   I am just kind of blown away what he's doing.
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:47.040]   This is a night harvest at Hudson Ranch in Napa.
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:50.280]   And it's pretty cool what they're doing.
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:55.200]   His goal now is to get something called a FPV drone, first person video drone, which
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:56.560]   they fly very fast.
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:58.360]   You wear a visor to fly them.
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:04.040]   And they're being used to create extreme drone videos.
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:05.040]   I don't know.
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.760]   It's going to be wild.
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:08.760]   Anyway, these are really beautiful videos.
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:10.600]   Oh, those are wonderful.
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:11.600]   Yeah.
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:14.880]   So we have a leading drone in journalism expert at my school.
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:15.880]   Do you really?
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:16.880]   Yeah.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:17.880]   No, so we're teaching this.
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:18.880]   This drone--
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:20.280]   This stuff, it's amazing.
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:21.440]   It's really amazing.
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:24.400]   And so he's becoming very adept.
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:29.280]   He was flying his drone under the Golden Gate Bridge, I think, a couple of days ago.
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:30.280]   Really?
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.280]   No.
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.280]   No.
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:35.360]   He said, son.
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.800]   I don't want to know about it.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:40.440]   But he's also-- he loves getting the surfers.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:42.240]   It's pretty cool what you can do with the drone now.
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:46.160]   The other person who loves drone stuff is Richard Jingeris at Google.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.160]   Really?
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:47.160]   He just--
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.160]   Oh, he loves it.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:48.680]   He flies.
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:52.280]   He takes his drone whenever he travels, when we used to.
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:56.040]   So I just-- I thought, I'll give my boy a little plug.
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:57.880]   He's hanging on the port on Instagram.
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:58.640]   Well, you should.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:19:59.200]   Yeah.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:02.360]   He's doing some really neat stuff with the drones.
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:04.400]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:08.440]   Let me see which one we got to pick out here.
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:16.720]   I think-- so Pitney Bose does a regular survey of packing, parcel shipping index.
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:21.560]   It reached 103 billion parcels shipped globally in 2019.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.960]   So this is pre-COVID.
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:25.320]   Imagine what's going to happen then.
[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:29.080]   Total value of 351 billion.
[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:32.960]   Every second 3,248 packages are shipped.
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:33.960]   Jesus.
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:34.960]   3,248.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:37.760]   3,248 every second.
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:38.280]   Second.
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:38.880]   Holy cow.
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:44.120]   China has 63.5 billion parcels.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:46.600]   The US only 14.7 billion.
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:48.480]   What does that tell you about the comparable economies?
[02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:49.760]   Yes, one is bigger than the other.
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:57.680]   But that says e-commerce has gone berserk in China.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:58.200]   Wow.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:00.160]   Oh, they also have a lot more people.
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:04.080]   And a lot more people and a lot more land.
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:13.240]   So it grew 26% year on year, followed by Norway, which grew 24% year on year.
[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:16.040]   This is everything you ever want to know about parcel shipping.
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:16.560]   It is.
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.720]   And then from 2013, there were 10 parcels per person.
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.560]   To now 27.
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:24.440]   Again, this is before COVID.
[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:26.280]   Wow.
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:28.160]   Oh, my God.
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:29.120]   I actually--
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.160]   Go ahead.
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:31.640]   Go ahead.
[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:33.160]   Yeah, I get like 300 parcels a year.
[02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:37.400]   I was just thinking, like, how many packages do you have to get here?
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:40.240]   At least one a day.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:41.120]   It's all work, Stacey.
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:41.960]   It's all work for you.
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:43.320]   We know.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:53.200]   The TSA, speaking of numbers, is now talking about the number of travelers coming
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.120]   through checkpoint travel.
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:22:02.080]   This is one year ago, it was 2.1 million.
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:04.240]   One year ago, same weekday.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:05.960]   It's 662,000.
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:07.360]   But that is up a lot.
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:10.280]   In fact, it got up to a million on October 18.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:11.440]   So the numbers--
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:12.880]   How long did it get?
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:13.960]   It got pretty low.
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:15.880]   The numbers are going up.
[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:18.120]   People are getting back in the air.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:24.200]   If I go back to March or other April, 114,000 was one of the low points.
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.040]   Go back to April 6, because that's when Quibi launched.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.200]   Yeah, it took people right out of the air.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:31.720]   Yep, yep, yep.
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:33.840]   So travel is going up.
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:38.440]   And in fact, it broke a million for the first time in a long time on October 18.
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:42.320]   That's less than half of the normal total from one year ago.
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:45.000]   But still, it's coming back.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.440]   It's surprising even to think about it.
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:48.680]   A million people traveling in one day.
[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:49.960]   I'm not ready to fly.
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:51.000]   I'm not here to fly.
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.440]   No.
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:52.960]   No.
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:55.120]   I'm not getting in that tube with a--
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:55.960]   Not going anywhere.
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:57.200]   No.
[02:22:57.200 --> 02:23:01.440]   The flight to nowhere, the Australian flight to nowhere, just in the sanity.
[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:04.360]   I'm going to risk, and I'm not going to get anywhere.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:04.880]   Yeah.
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:05.560]   What do you get?
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:07.080]   Nothing.
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:12.160]   It's not so much fun to fly that I would just do it as recreationally.
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:12.600]   I don't get that.
[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:15.200]   I do miss the cookies in the Alaskan Lounge.
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:17.480]   The molasses cookies are really delicious.
[02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:19.640]   OK, there you go.
[02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:21.200]   All right, Mike, we gave you some time.
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:21.720]   All right.
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:22.800]   Anything for us?
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:23.800]   I got something.
[02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:27.640]   This was something I got from Kickstarter just recently, which is--
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:31.040]   let me see if I can get it here so it doesn't fade away.
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:33.880]   It's a little mini--
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:34.880]   I got to move back here.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:37.040]   Looks like it says mover erase.
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:37.840]   Mover erase.
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:41.720]   It's a little mini whiteboard that's magnetic.
[02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:46.920]   And I can pop it onto my screen.
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:50.040]   It's better than a post-it note.
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:51.160]   Well, that's fun.
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:54.440]   It's a basically post-it note size whiteboard.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:56.000]   And it's got a magnet in it.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.400]   Yeah.
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:58.600]   Right?
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:01.040]   It was just one of those things where I had opened up Kickstarter
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:04.560]   and I saw it and I said, yeah, that is useful.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:05.680]   So I just got them.
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:06.640]   Well, you weren't alone.
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:09.840]   They raised $145,000.
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:11.880]   I presume they're going to start selling them.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.680]   That's really cool.
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:14.760]   So it has a backing.
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.280]   I'm going to have different colors.
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:17.960]   Yeah, they have different colors.
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:18.560]   I have--
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:19.520]   Because I have a--
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:21.080]   I put them on my whiteboard.
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:22.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:26.480]   Well, now that's a little bit cold to Newcastle, but still.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:27.840]   Yeah.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.840]   So don't use sticky notes.
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:31.600]   Use mover erases.
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:35.040]   How many did you buy?
[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:35.840]   I forget.
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.120]   They have these different bundles.
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.480]   So I think I ended up with 12 of them.
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.560]   That's really cool.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.640]   See, I have about--
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:47.640]   let me see here.
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:51.760]   You see that pile there?
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:53.800]   That's about 12 big whiteboards.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:55.080]   Yeah, he has all these whiteboards.
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:57.880]   It's so bizarre.
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:24:59.400]   You don't ever want to erase them?
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:00.680]   Is that the reason?
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:04.040]   Well, I outlined the book on it.
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:05.440]   And I want to go back and change it.
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:06.720]   And then I do eventually.
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:09.320]   But then the problem is you leave the ink on the whiteboard
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.400]   for too long and it's impossible to play that.
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:11.920]   No, no, no.
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.280]   You use Windex.
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:15.480]   I know, but it's yucky.
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.000]   Oh.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:20.600]   I tracked my daughter's height because I'm an idiot.
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:22.040]   On a whiteboard.
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:23.400]   And so I had to go over it with that.
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:23.960]   Oh, no.
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:24.480]   Permanent marker.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:27.720]   No, that is not commitment.
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:29.480]   That is not commitment.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:32.920]   So at the bottom, I had to write exactly how high it was
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:35.440]   up from the floor in our old house.
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:38.560]   You didn't want to write on a wall or anything?
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:39.920]   Well, we move so often.
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:42.160]   Oh, I guess, yeah, two permanent.
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:45.160]   Yeah, my-- all my kids' growth--
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:45.960]   what do you call that?
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:46.680]   The growth chart.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:47.600]   Growth charts.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:49.720]   All my kids' growth charts are in a house
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:51.520]   that we don't own anymore.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.440]   Yeah, so I at least own the whiteboard.
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:56.280]   And I know exactly how high up I need to keep it.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.640]   So her measurements stay accurate.
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:25:59.200]   It works.
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:01.080]   So clever.
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:02.440]   It was unintentional.
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:04.120]   So whiteboard.
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:05.800]   Honey, you're not going to be around long.
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:07.600]   So let's just put it on this whiteboard.
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:08.560]   I know.
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.880]   She's not sure what to keep you or not.
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:14.440]   She weren't adopted, but she might be.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.320]   You were just excited and she was there.
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:17.400]   I was like, whoa, let's mark it.
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:19.280]   And then we marked it another time.
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:21.160]   And then because I never cleaned my whiteboard.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.920]   And now I have a record of my daughter's sake.
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:25.120]   OK, that's actually really cool.
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:26.400]   And you can bring it with you, which is--
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.760]   it's turned out it was the right thing to do there.
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:30.640]   We have come to the end of this fabulous show.
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:33.920]   Mike Masnick, I am so glad you were here for our lengthy
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:36.120]   discussion of the Google.
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:38.960]   And he trusts that-- we didn't need to really go into it.
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:40.920]   I thought we did a good job, but that was fine.
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:41.440]   Yeah.
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:41.600]   Yeah.
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:44.040]   I think the DOJ waited till I was on the show to do that.
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:44.920]   They knew.
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:45.280]   They knew.
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:47.600]   They kept saying it was going to be any day now.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.760]   Techdirt.com is the place to read.
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:51.040]   Mike's great writing.
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:54.240]   He also has a podcast there.
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:56.320]   Is it a daily podcast?
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:57.360]   No, weekly.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:26:57.960]   Weekly.
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:00.600]   Casey Newton's on your most recent one.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:01.400]   That's awesome.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:03.480]   I can't wait to hear that.
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:04.840]   Techdirt.com, thank you, Mike.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:06.520]   We really appreciate it.
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.040]   Sure.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:08.440]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:09.480]   You all know him.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:12.640]   He's the director of the town night center for entrepreneurial
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:13.320]   journalism.
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:14.720]   I should have missed to Google.
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:17.600]   At the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:20.640]   at the City University of New York, buzzmachine.com,
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:22.000]   at Jeff Jarvis.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.880]   Many books, many more coming.
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:26.160]   He's prolific.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:27.120]   One, I hope.
[02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:30.360]   At least one more on Gutenberg.
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:31.840]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:35.400]   And Stacey Higgins-Botham-Stacey on IOT.com is her website.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:36.040]   Get the news.
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:36.040]   I have--
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:37.160]   It's free.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:37.640]   What?
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:38.640]   I have two things.
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:39.280]   Two things.
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:39.960]   Sorry.
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:43.960]   One, I just said that you should use Windex on your whiteboard.
[02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:45.400]   I use it on mine because mine's class,
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:47.320]   but I forgot that normals don't--
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:48.080]   you shouldn't do that.
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:49.040]   So I'm sorry.
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:50.040]   I don't want people to--
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:50.640]   Oh, geez.
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:51.120]   I know.
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:52.320]   This was going to be horrifying.
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:53.960]   For section 230, we'd be--
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:55.520]   I was going to say without section 230.
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:56.640]   Oh, my god.
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:00.840]   I'm irresponsible for many whiteboards being damaged.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:02.280]   And then just the other thing.
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:04.840]   Next Tuesday, I'm doing an event on the smart home.
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:05.920]   And I forgot to promote it.
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:06.200]   I'm sorry.
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:07.440]   Can I promote it really fast?
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:08.080]   You didn't forget.
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:09.080]   You're doing it right now.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:10.600]   Go to Stacey and IOT.com.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.160]   Click the events tab.
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.920]   And you can go-- it's free, right?
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:16.720]   To register for--
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:17.600]   It's free.
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:18.440]   Level up the smart home.
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:23.200]   We'll be talking about domestic violence and the smart home
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:25.480]   and using connected devices to surveil people.
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:27.600]   We're talking about sustainability.
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:29.520]   It's going to be really awesome.
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.800]   And you should totally come.
[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:33.240]   Yay.
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:35.040]   Yay.
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:38.080]   Free to sign up and always fascinating.
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:42.800]   October 27, 9am Pacific to noon.
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.120]   That's great.
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:48.320]   And fortunately, thanks to the candy lobbyists,
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:51.480]   daylight saving time doesn't end till the day after Halloween.
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:55.640]   So you don't have to do any adjustment.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:00.520]   9am Pacific is going to be 9am Pacific, October 27.
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:05.840]   Our show is normally 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern every Wednesday.
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:07.560]   Right now, that's 2100 UTC.
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:12.640]   But come November 1, we're going to set our clocks back.
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:15.880]   And that means it will be 2,200 UTC.
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.200]   But you don't have to worry about that yet.
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:20.680]   Unless your summertime has ended, which I think it is,
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:23.440]   and then you have to figure that one out.
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:24.680]   You can watch us live.
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:26.680]   This is why live is really not worth it.
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:28.480]   Twit.tv/live.
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:29.720]   There's audio and video.
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:34.640]   If you're doing that, chat with us, irc.twit.tv.
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.440]   On-demand versions that you can listen to anytime of the day
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:40.680]   or night are available at the website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:42.400]   There's a YouTube channel.
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:44.280]   All about this week in Google.
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:45.280]   That's the whole thing.
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:47.280]   It's all there, every show.
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.840]   So you can watch there, subscribe there.
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:50.800]   But the best thing to do, you get a podcast client
[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:53.360]   and subscribe and that, that way you'll get it automatically.
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:57.760]   The minute it's available audio or video.
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:29:59.040]   Thank you everybody.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:00.960]   I thank you, thanks to our hosts.
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:02.600]   Thanks to all of you for watching.
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:05.720]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:07.280]   Bye-bye.
[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:09.480]   Be sure to check out the other shows on the network.
[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:11.880]   Like my other show, Hands on Wellness.
[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:14.040]   I love to share different tips and tricks that's
[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:17.640]   going to help you get a better grasp on your personal wellness.
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:22.080]   Just go to twit.tv/how and subscribe now.

[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:31.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:33.960]   (upbeat music)
