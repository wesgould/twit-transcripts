[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.360]   recorded November 16, 2011.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.200]   It goes to 11.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.960]   This week in Google is brought to you by Ford,

[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.880]   And we've got the Google-ish-ness of on my right here,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.080]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.520]   the author of What Would Google Do?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.560]   Hello, JJ.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.960]   And of course, this brand new book, Public Parts,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.640]   all about the role of publicness in a world gone mad for privacy.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.720]   Also, to my left, they've now famous fully employed,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.960]   Gina Trapani, smarterware.org.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.520]   And her app, thinkupapp.com is now in public release, 1.0.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.680]   1.0, out of beta.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   Golf flat.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   Yay.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.520]   Thank you.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   Thank you.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120]   I've been as stressed per week.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.640]   Does that mean people could just go on the website
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.840]   and download it now?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920]   People can go on the website and download it.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.360]   You can install it on your own web server.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.200]   It's about the same amount of effort as WordPress.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.160]   Or if you don't want to deal with a web server,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.360]   we have an Amazon EC2 launcher.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.120]   So you need your Amazon keys.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.560]   Pop them in under 60 seconds.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.880]   It'll spin up an instance and start running it.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.840]   Thinkup is-- we kind of selected for pretty geeky users
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720]   who have a lot of followers and social networks.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.200]   And you're going to have to pick up
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.600]   API keys from Twitter and from Facebook.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.880]   There's still a lot of rough edges.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.360]   I think someone said if you're not embarrassed by your 1.0
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.200]   release, then you waited too long.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.840]   And there are definitely things on there
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   that could be better.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.600]   But if you've got big followership on different networks
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.100]   and you're interested in archiving your data
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.760]   and visualizing some of your conversations,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.400]   I hope you'll check it out.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   The installation is about the same amount of effort
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.720]   as WordPress.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080]   So if you've done that, you'll have no problem with ThinkUp.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.840]   I can back that up because I've had--
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.560]   Gina's right kindly.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.920]   Let me run my Twitter stuff into ThinkUp for some time.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.000]   I'm almost here now.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.560]   And it's amazing.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.960]   Wow.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.240]   You've been such a great tester, Leo.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   Thank you.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.840]   You have such a huge data set.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.400]   And you really helped us kind of want
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680]   to kind of push the limits of the database as much as possible.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.080]   And your data along with Jeff's and a few other people
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.800]   has really helped us optimize our indexes and make it fast
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.880]   and see what happens when you throw millions of followers
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.380]   at it.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.080]   So thank you for that.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.920]   Well, I don't have millions.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.440]   But the few hundred thousand I have are all yours, Gina.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.280]   Oh, you're so cool.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.200]   Anything you want.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.280]   I belong to us.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   And thank you.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.680]   I guess I should probably now set up my own server
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440]   and stop mooching off of you.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   But--
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.800]   No, you've been an awesome data tester.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.080]   I really appreciate your--
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.680]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.080]   I appreciate your OAuth key, as always.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.320]   My OAuth is yours anytime.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.240]   This is an important day.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.800]   This is just some program note that in about--
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.680]   less than an hour now, in about 45 minutes,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.960]   Google will do an announcement.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   Probably the Google Music.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.640]   In fact, we know it's the Google Music announcement.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.040]   And so we will follow that live.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.160]   And we'll have our commentary.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.240]   Tom Merritt will join us from the TNT Newsroom.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   And so we'll have 45 minutes of this show.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.520]   But the crew will continue with the Google Music,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.440]   or whatever it is.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   Whatever it is, yeah.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.600]   Announcement.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.480]   It's also American censorship day.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.880]   And I think this is very important.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.840]   And I wanted to point this right at the beginning of the show
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.080]   today.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.320]   Today, Congress is holding a hearing on SOPA.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.080]   And it's very important that everybody who
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.480]   is listening in the United States today
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.880]   call their members of Congress and protest.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   If you go to leoville.com, I'll give you an example.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.440]   I, as many other webmasters across the country,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.400]   have put up this picture here when
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.840]   you go to my website, website blocked.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.640]   And this is the kind of thing that you will see if SOPA passes.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.240]   This site has been blocked to Americans
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.440]   by the US government firewall.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.400]   Now, if that sounds scary to you--
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.960]   and by the way, the standards for what the government needs
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.920]   to do to block something are not, in my opinion,
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.520]   full due process-- you should absolutely
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.920]   fight to protect the internet.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.080]   And just allowing anyone that architecture,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.120]   to change the architecture of the net,
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.200]   not to plug, but at the end of public parts,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.880]   I argue the last principle I talk about
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.520]   is the need for the architecture of the net
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.240]   to stay open and distributed.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.720]   And this puts a chokehold.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.200]   And if our government can use it for real purposes,
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.000]   China's government can use it and is using it
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.240]   for real purposes, that kills the net, folks.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.080]   And this is, Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.760]   But I believe that this is being done
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.600]   by the music industry, the television industry,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.440]   the content industry, to protect their rights,
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.280]   their copyright.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.520]   So they think, yes.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.160]   So they think.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.320]   But I'm delighted to see a large consortium of technology
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.040]   companies today come out with full-page ads
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   in at least the Wall Street Journal and New York Times,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.120]   Google, Twitter, eBay, Facebook, AOL, Zinga,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.960]   and a whole bunch of companies say, no, no, don't do this.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.480]   It's stupid.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.600]   Well, and Matt cuts.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.240]   On his personal blog-- of course, we all
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.920]   know Matt, who is the spam fighter at Google.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.800]   We've had him on the show many, many times.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.040]   If you go to Mattcuts' blog at mattcuts.com,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.840]   I need your help.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.000]   Please call your Congress person.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   It takes a few minutes to learn about SOPA
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.200]   and the Protect IP bill.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.120]   It's but SOPA in the house.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   It's Protect IP in the Senate.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   And they're doing hearings right now.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.360]   Everybody agrees.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.680]   This is everybody who knows what they're talking about.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.280]   Agreeze.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.800]   The problem is members of Congress
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.160]   are often not very well informed on these issues.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.840]   And maybe they get a lot of funding--
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.920]   Yes.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.560]   --from these companies.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.000]   And look, absent hearing from their constituents,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.240]   that's going to influence them.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.720]   But ultimately, all the funding matters to them
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.880]   is to get votes.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.120]   We're the voters.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.160]   We matter more than anybody.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.440]   But there's no excuse if we don't do this.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.280]   So please contact your member of Congress.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.800]   This is American censorship day.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.880]   Find out more at EFF.org or americansensorship.org
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.560]   or Mattcuts blog or just a lot of places.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.000]   This is the single most important thing that you can do today.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.600]   I agree.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.000]   And actually, you're always going to do this earlier.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   But maybe after the show, I will call my members of Congress.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.040]   I ran out of time.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.640]   And you should-- very important that you understand
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.320]   that the best way to influence members of Congress
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.720]   is to snail mail.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.080]   We don't have time for that right now.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.040]   But snail mail, because they see the postmarker,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.400]   and they know you're a constituent,
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.960]   or call them from a local number.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.600]   And it's not a elaborate call.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.480]   You just call up and say, I just want to register this.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.880]   Please tell my senator Feinstein that I am dead set
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.240]   against the IP Protect Act.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.440]   And I please hope that she will vote against it.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.960]   And I'm a constituent of hers.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.320]   And if she does, she'll have my vote.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.440]   And if she does not, she will lose my vote.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.200]   Something like that.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.680]   It doesn't take a whole lot.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.640]   They have a little box.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.120]   They put a check box in.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.560]   And if you have a website, if you
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.480]   go to this americansensorship.org site,
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.640]   there's a simple snippet, a JavaScript snippet
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.040]   you can put on your site.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.160]   This is all I did for Leaville.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.400]   Yeah, I got to set this up.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.560]   Yes, apparently.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.720]   If you go to the tech guy site, I'll just do that
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.640]   real quickly just to show you.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.880]   We should do this on Twitch.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.440]   I don't control the Twitch source code or I would have.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.600]   But if you go to the tech guy site, that will pop up.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.200]   And that is a very dramatic way to remind people
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.280]   that this is what life will look like if we
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.840]   allow this to happen.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.240]   We do not want--
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.040]   I've been to China.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   We've been to China.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   You've been to China.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.800]   We know what it's like in countries where they have
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.240]   firewalls that block access to the full and free internet.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.160]   It's not a good thing.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.120]   It's not what we want.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.320]   It's incredibly jarring.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.680]   You know it intellectually, but when you experience it,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   it's incredible.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.400]   So this is really, really important.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.880]   So I think this is great that they implemented these
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   JavaScript snippets.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.400]   I love it.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.960]   I wish they had set it up sooner.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.600]   Because it really does give you the experience of what
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   would be like.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   It's not too late.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.240]   If you go to Tumblr, I think that you'll
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.600]   see a good example of that I'm being told by the chat room
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:05.920]   as well.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   But you can see that Tumblr is a great example of the
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   Tumblr.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   Because Tumblr and Facebook are two sites that would be
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   very much immediately impacted by this.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.760]   And then all of those of us who link to things, if you
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.640]   have a story today somewhere on the web about the impact on
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.360]   journals, if you link to a site that's considered to be
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   in violation of the par, you in violation.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   Things like that.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   It's calling.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   It's calling.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   First freaking amendment people.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   Tumblr, this is really interesting.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   They basically just blacked out.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.040]   I see your Tumblr dashboard, but they black out every single
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.280]   post individually.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   This is really neat.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Isn't that great?
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   Good for them.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   Good for Tumblr.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.280]   Mine's not doing it right now.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.520]   But yeah, if you go to your Tumblr, you'll see it.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   Wow.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.520]   So good.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   Good way to start.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   We've got some big stuff today.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.760]   This is a big day.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.920]   Big day for some of us yesterday when we got our fires.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:06.720]   I've ridden in my car.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.400]   You'd never know it.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.800]   But you know the slide, slide-to-enlock kind of is a giveaway.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.960]   Here I'll show you a little more.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   Close up.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.320]   I haven't done anything to customize this.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.720]   This is the out of the box experience.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.240]   My books, these are all the books I've ever bought.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.160]   So if I say, oh, you know, I'd like to get my design
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.960]   patterns book on here, I click that little button and it will
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.360]   download to my Kindle.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.920]   These are apps.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.800]   And in fact, we can see more apps if we click the apps button up here.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.080]   These are apps that come on the device or are encouraged.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.240]   For instance, Comixology.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.200]   Again, you just click the download button and this is a recommended and you can install
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   it.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   Now, this is very obviously Android.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.680]   Anybody who's got an Android phone, you probably recognize the interface.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.120]   You even see the Amazon App Store logo right up there.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.200]   I hear that they've already got a one-click root exploit.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:05.240]   That's a good sign because now some people have complained about this in terms of speed.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.120]   The performance is not great.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.600]   In fact, let me go to a book.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.760]   This by the way, I do not like.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   You see this?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.760]   Now, those two apps that I've used are now part of this cover flow.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   It's really driving me crazy and I don't know how you control that.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.080]   But let's go to a book that's on here.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.520]   You see how slowly that did it?
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.200]   And watch the page turn.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   It's just a little...
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.920]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   It's okay.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   A little bit laggy.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   It's laggy.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.520]   And people have been complaining about the speed of this as David Pogue said, "It's just
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.160]   too laggy."
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.680]   Others have complained that tapping the icons.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.360]   Now, this mine feels fairly snappy.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.760]   Maybe I haven't loaded it down yet with enough stuff.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:51.400]   Here's a pulse, which it comes with, which is a great little news reader application.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.520]   And of course, there's the magazine stand, which is right here, the news stand.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.600]   And that's the thing that people will be most interested in is taking a look at magazines.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.480]   And I have to say that experience is a little disappointing as well, at least so far because
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.240]   these magazines really...
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.760]   Here, I'll get...
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   It's turkey time.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.200]   I'll get bon appetit by current issue.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.960]   Oh, I do not have a valid credit card.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.720]   Well, I have to set up one click on this.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.560]   I thought that one was going to be free.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.000]   But what they basically feel like is PDFs.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.760]   And in fact, in many cases, you have to squeeze it and zoom it to see the full page.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.600]   It does go sideways so you can see the magazine that way.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   But it is not a very good magazine experience.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.880]   And so far, these really feel like scanned in magazines.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.840]   I don't see anything dedicated to the magazine experience.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.600]   That's probably going to change.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.640]   Let's remember it's early days for all of this.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.520]   Did you guys either of you get a Kindle?
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   No.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.600]   No, I didn't get it.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.200]   So when you take it out of the box and you sign in, Leo, you're signing in to Amazon.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.160]   In fact, it knew it was my fire.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.280]   In fact, all the kindles, when you get them and you open them up, they'll be preregistered
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   to you.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.680]   So in hand, my Amazon credentials.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.280]   I'm not sure exactly.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   Maybe I need for one click.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   It's probably for one click.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.080]   I need to log into Amazon.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.920]   Right, right.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.760]   And there's...
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.600]   So there's no Google guts, no visible Google.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.920]   Well, for those of us who use Google, we can kind of recognize some of this.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   But try this.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   There's no slide down notifications.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.480]   There's no apps.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.240]   There's no Google apps there, right?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.840]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   Let's see.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   Is there a web search?
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   Any Google apps?
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   No.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.840]   I mean, these are the apps that are recommended.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.280]   So search for Google under the apps if you would.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.560]   Well, I don't have to.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   This is it.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.560]   But you can...
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.560]   Oh, that's it.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.560]   It's not a full app store.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   Oh.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.320]   Like you could download unknown sources like you can.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.560]   You can do third party sources.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   So...
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.560]   Right.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.360]   So I would do that, I guess, from the settings.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.240]   Let's get the settings open here and take a look.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   I mean, I think...
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.640]   So you can email someone an APK or download an APK from the web?
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640]   Exactly.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.640]   Interesting.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640]   So, I mean, that's how they're hacking it, of course.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.440]   And if you look at this, you know, you can tell, oh, yeah, that's Android, isn't it?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   You know, let's look at...
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.280]   What do you think Google really thinks of this?
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.880]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.080]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.960]   Let's go to the web.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.400]   If search goes through Google, then they're going to love it, right?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.640]   So let me search.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.600]   Let's search for censorship.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   By the way, nice, easy to use keyboard.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   It is...
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.560]   You know, I don't know if you'll be able to install other ones.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.720]   This is, I guess, kind of pretty close to the...
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.120]   See, that's a Google search.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.920]   So Google's not going to mind that.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   Right?
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   Now, Google's going to like that.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   That's good for them.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.640]   That's the whole point of Android.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.200]   I'm sure they'd like the Google-licious Gmail and Maps apps and so forth.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.880]   And maybe at some point we'll be able to...
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.080]   Well, there's no GPS, so I guess that's why Maps wouldn't make sense.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   Here's the built-in email map, or app.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   And you know, it's just...
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.080]   Oh, Gmail's the top of the list there.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   Gmail's number one.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.080]   Which makes sense.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   So I haven't set it up yet.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.040]   I just literally just opened the box.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.240]   So I'll have some more to talk about over the weeks and months to come.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.160]   Any device that searches the web using Google is good for Google.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   Well, like that, right?
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   I think you can't do that.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.160]   It's a pretty...
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.480]   I think it's a very polished interface.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.840]   It looks good.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.720]   This is the interface to the Amazon bookstore.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.520]   Top 100 paid books, children's picture books.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.200]   They know that that's a big market that Kindle hasn't served up to this point because it's
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.960]   been black and white.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.320]   Best fiction of 2011, new and noteworthy.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.760]   So...
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.960]   And here's the top 100 free books.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   Kind of like that.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.280]   How's the partner feel of it?
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   It's big.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   It's heavy.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   I have it in a case here, by the way.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.200]   Let me take it out of the case so you can see what it looks like without the case.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.120]   It is very much like the BlackBerry playbook in terms of size and fit and feel, although
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.720]   I fix it, torn it down.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.160]   And in fact, internals are not the same by any means.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.560]   So it is its own hardware device.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.080]   I think the only complaint people have is it doesn't feel very snappy.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   It's snappy enough.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.160]   I mean, remember the Kindle, black and white, kindles aren't snappy at all.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   How's it with the video?
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.960]   Oh, I can sign into my music.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.120]   This is all my music that's already on Amazon.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.040]   So that's kind of nice.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   I don't actually...
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.400]   Now, can I play it?
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.080]   No, I have to download it first and then play it.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   What am I...
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.280]   Will it do a YouTube video?
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   Yes it will.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.880]   Yes it will.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.240]   Let's go to YouTube.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.640]   It's got flash built on it.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   But no YouTube app.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.800]   That's kind of interesting, although that could be solved.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.000]   And it may be that, you know, remember they've got a big Amazon...
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Video streaming.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Store and video streaming.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I mean, all of that stuff will be.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Let's go to YouTube.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.160]   Netflix and Hulu Plus is there too.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   We ran...
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.160]   Netflix works nicely on it.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   I think, yeah.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.200]   So let's play some dancing babies here.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   See how they look.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   That's very nice.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.040]   You know, you can't go wrong with dancing babies.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   I can't.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   It's interesting because the aspect ratio for YouTube is perfect.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.640]   But people have complained about the fact that other movies have black bars top or bottom
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.320]   and you can't resize it.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   But it does fit YouTube just right.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.480]   Yeah, it looks great.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:38.640]   Actually, now I'm intrigued what's going to happen here.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.920]   I think that's Jeff and Gina.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   I think...
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   I'll stop talking.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.960]   Remember, this is only $200 a chat room saying and that's an excellent point, right?
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.400]   You know, it's...
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.880]   For $200, I think there will be in a lot of stockings and it'll fit.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.880]   And a lot of Christmas...
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.880]   Under a lot of Christmas trees and a lot of Hanukkah.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   They have this old outer.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.880]   Yeah, babe.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   They apparently...
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.360]   No, well, we don't know because Amazon doesn't say.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.640]   I think you could still buy it though.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.440]   It says on Amazon site you can buy them today.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.000]   One thing that's kind of interesting is that the rumors are that they've made $5 million
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.040]   to get them through Christmas.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.440]   So they expect this to do very well indeed.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.000]   So this is basically a device for someone who loves the Kindle or reads a lot and is
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.920]   also vaguely interested in the iPad but doesn't want to spend the money on the iPad or on
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   tablet.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.920]   That's basically it.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.840]   Somebody who's heard about tablets hasn't sold yet.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   Right.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   And did...
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   Oh.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   Did he just...
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   I think we lost.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   Oh, that works.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Did you buy your...
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   Would you buy your mother one, Gina?
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.440]   That's a good question.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440]   That's a really good question.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.960]   My mom is not into technology at all.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.720]   I showed her the original Kindle and she was super excited about it.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   She was an English teacher.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.280]   So the idea of having all those books in your hand was exciting.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.680]   She did question me about paper.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.800]   I think I would buy one of those for my mom.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.040]   My mom loves the original Kindle and because she can make the text big, she's 77.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   Yes.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   She loves...
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   That was a big thing for my mom.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   She says I can read again.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   I haven't been able to read.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   Yep.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   It brought her back to me.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   I got so angry with the one at the bottom of the Kindle.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.000]   You remember that sign that saw an episode when Jerry got his parents the fruit of the
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   month and the plump and they got all angry with him?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   The fruit!
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It keeps coming.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's where my father was with this thing.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Why would I want this thing?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.760]   Dad, God, they're like teenagers.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.440]   But I tell you, I tell you, I'm going to be pissed for a moment here.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.880]   I'm in Toronto today.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.440]   I'm doing some business, but then I'm going to do these events tomorrow night in Toronto
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.560]   and Friday night in Ottawa thanks to a group called Third Tuesday.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   Sold out.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   This is wonderful.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.320]   I go to Indigo down the street to sign the books.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.480]   Not one copy.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.160]   Not one copy in any damned Indigo in the whole freaking country and it's the only bookstore
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.720]   there is.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.200]   Why do you need a bookstore anymore?
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.760]   Why do you need a publisher anymore?
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   It's absurd.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.760]   It's unfortunate, isn't it?
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   It really is unfortunate.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.240]   So what happens with the fire and all that?
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.680]   It's be happy as it is a way to still distribute, you know, stuff and it eats the hell out of
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.920]   the old way which is effed.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:24.800]   Well and somebody like you, Jeff, who has an audience and you know, it's instant.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.320]   So somebody's watching, they go, I want that book.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.640]   There's no, there's no resistors.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.640]   There's no friction.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.880]   Boom, they got it.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.920]   And that's good for everybody.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   Gradient friends.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.080]   Don't go buy the cobalt thing.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   That's an Indigo.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.560]   Buy the fire and give it on Amazon.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.920]   Well and that's by the way, we should probably say it.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.240]   Is anybody here getting the Barnes and Noble tablet?
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.800]   Are we going to have anything we compared this with?
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   We should probably get one.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   Is that funny?
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   Isn't that funny?
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.740]   I mean, Jay Lynch is doing the commercials.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.320]   Okay, we'll get one.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.920]   Tough life, it's wet.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.320]   Can I go ahead and order one, Leo?
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   I don't want to leave.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.640]   We really should have bought one before this and I'm embarrassed.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.080]   But it's funny.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.720]   We're doing a review show, we're launching a review show and we're getting everything.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   Except there's some--
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   Congratulations, by the way.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   Big hire.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.200]   Yeah, well yeah, Nicole Lee will be our producer on this show.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:24.000]   Great woman I've known for years, she used to work for me on tech TV and it's going to
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.040]   be easy to get people to review things like the fire.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.160]   A little harder to get people to review things like the nook.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.760]   We'll figure it out.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.960]   So there is already a one click.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   Death to all 110.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.200]   Posted a one click recipe.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.560]   You have to have super one click 2.2 and Android SDK and well as you can see a little
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.720]   bit of knowledge.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.960]   I'm waiting for the app.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.400]   But you know, if you can root this that easily and it literally took less than a day, just
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.960]   a matter of time before people are putting ice cream sandwich on here and this could
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.360]   very well be a full bore tablet.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Not as powerful though and I think that's probably--
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.360]   Couldn't handle ice cream sandwich?
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.680]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.440]   I mean, I think that maybe that's why Amazon didn't put more memory in this.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.440]   You know, maybe they were--
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   Interesting.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.960]   Yeah, maybe they were aware of this potential.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.520]   You know, that was what happened to the Barnes and Noble tablet immediately and it became
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.840]   a very popular tablet as a result.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:32.040]   I fix it, has done the tear down, taken it apart, looked inside and you can see what's
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.440]   in here.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.160]   It's a smaller battery than the iPad.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.960]   Although it is mostly battery.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.720]   It's four--
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.000]   Why are circuit boards green?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.400]   That was my Andy Riemomond.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.880]   Why is it with circuit boards?
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   Why are they green?
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   Why are they all green?
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   That's a great question.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.360]   I'll have to ask Waz next time I see him.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   Wouldn't it look good in blue?
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360]   Look at that.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.040]   There, we have a blue circuit board.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   There you go.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   So once they took it apart, this is the main thing.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   That was my--
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.760]   8 gigs of flash memory, 512 megs of RAM.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.880]   That may be one of the reasons it's not so fast.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.280]   It has a Texas Instruments microprocessor in here.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.600]   In fact, it's all Texas Instruments including the audio and everything else.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.120]   The Bluetooth FM Wi-Fi is from Georgian.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:37.280]   So, I guess-- I'm not sure about this processor, but I'm guessing that-- where is the processor?
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.160]   I'm guessing it's a little bit of a less powerful processor in here.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.960]   It seems like kind of planned obsolescence right then when something's up for you.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   Yeah, it's an older TIO map chip.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.480]   So it's not-- I think this is-- it's either planned obsolescence or really worrying that
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.840]   people might want to hack the dang thing.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.840]   Dual core 1 gigahertz TIO map 4430 says sideways in the chatroom.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.720]   Well, yeah, with an older support chip.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.840]   So this is an interesting, yeah.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.600]   And answering a question in the chatroom, I think there's no Bluetooth, right?
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.160]   They have a Bluetooth chip in it.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.840]   So it has capability, but they don't not-- do they don't, in fact, turn it on?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.160]   So the Wi-Fi chip has Bluetooth capability as I-- I-- oh, no.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.280]   --have it for reading this.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.760]   Anyway, that's an interesting tear down.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.280]   Most people were saying it doesn't feel super fast, super snappy.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.480]   It doesn't actually feel slow to me, but I haven't used it for very long.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.520]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.160]   If you're reading a book.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   Right.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   How fast do you need it to be?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.840]   Yeah, I mean, that's-- yeah.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.280]   And of course, it's a great portal.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.840]   Look at here is-- this is Amazon.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:56.200]   And this is one of the things they did very nicely with the window shop app on the iPad.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.680]   Very-- let's buy-- oh, let me buy that.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.120]   It's a buying machine.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.480]   Oh, let me buy that.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.240]   It's always been a buying machine.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.280]   Look how easy it was to buy that, right?
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:07.760]   Whoops.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.480]   Stop.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.080]   All the geeks want to turn it into a full-board tablet, right?
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.520]   It's an e-reader where you buy stuff to read.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.720]   That's what it isn't.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.880]   It looks like it does that pretty well.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.280]   It's not a bad-- it's not a bad e-reader, you know?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.760]   I mean, I love--
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.680]   I love the cover pieces too.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.960]   Say again?
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.840]   I work for the guy named Sean Sampson who's rethinking retail.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.720]   But imagine if you had this in a store.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.160]   You like, you know, probably for that, you need a camera or some means to say,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.760]   what's that device?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.800]   Did you buy it?
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   Right.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.720]   I think this is a nice crisp screen.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.680]   I never-- I wasn't one of those eink bigots who said I have to have an eink screen.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.160]   I think this is-- I like to turn it to CPA and make the text a little bit bigger.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.760]   And I think it's quite legible, you know?
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.440]   Does it have a speaker?
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   Somebody's asking whether or not you like the Kindle.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:56.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.880]   Ah, that's a good question.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.480]   I don't know if it'll read you, but it absolutely has a speaker because you--
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.000]   I think it's a music player.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   It's a music player, and it's a video player, and that's the whole idea of this thing.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.760]   You can, of course, buy.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.520]   You don't have to use that set.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.680]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.880]   You know, no one has a speaker.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.680]   Let's just see here.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.920]   We can watch a trailer of The Walking Dead.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.200]   Not suitable for all audiences.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   Yay!
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.040]   I'm not all audiences.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.040]   Let me turn--
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.480]   Perfers, sex, the violence.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.680]   You have to-- soft-- this is the future of Android, which I don't like, which is soft
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.720]   everything, right?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.000]   The only switch on this is an on/off switch.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   So if you're turning up things--
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.760]   Bossport complaint was hidden.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.360]   There it is, up at the right.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.240]   Yeah, that's got speakers.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.160]   Not very loud.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.120]   But they're loud enough.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.560]   I have to say, the screen looks good.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   And now this particular case I have is a little stand built into it, so I could absolutely
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   sit and watch this on an airplane or whatever.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.320]   If you have an iPad, is there any reason to buy this that you can imagine?
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:06.800]   Absolutely not.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.440]   The smaller size, you would be taking it with--
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   The smaller size would be it.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.360]   I mean, the iPad will do everything this does because of the Kindle app.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.400]   So you don't need the functionality, but you know, I do like the smaller size of something
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.200]   like this because you can put it in your pocket.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.480]   Well, I mean, the iPad won't stream up from Amazon, though.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   Ah, good point.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.880]   It won't stream video from Amazon.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.760]   I have to say, I love Amazon, it's just--
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.160]   I don't use-- I don't have any Apple hardware in my living room, so I just don't use any
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   of the iTunes stuff.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.760]   I mean, this weekend, I was going to go see Melancholya, the Lars Ventrion.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   It's a very rare movie.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   It was on Amazon streaming.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   What?
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   It's in the theater, but it's also on Amazon streaming.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.760]   Yeah, so--
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   I'm staying home.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   I'm watching it on my fire.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.240]   Yeah, and like on the iPad because it doesn't support Flash, you can't even purchase stuff
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.520]   from Amazon and say, hey, send this to my Tivo or whatever.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520]   So there you go.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.840]   Because it doesn't work for Flash.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.520]   But you know, that's-- I mean, you know, you've-- these access to so much video content
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.320]   through iTunes on the iPad, that's not going to be that big a deal, but--
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   Interesting.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   Interesting.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.320]   I do really like that.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   These are all prime videos that I could watch right now.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.160]   That's-- yeah, huh.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.480]   Because I'm an Amazon Prime person.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.080]   Big Julia Roberts fan.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.960]   I love Julia Roberts.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.280]   To me, if a movie has Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant-- I'm happy.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280]   You're in.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   I'm in.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   That's all I need.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280]   It's on.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.280]   It's on.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   It's on.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   I'm such a girl.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   It's my lovely Leo.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:43.000]   Yeah, no, I like-- I love romantic-- rom-coms as we chicks call them.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.600]   I think this looks great.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.800]   Leo, do you watch Dancing With The Stars?
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   I have.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:57.360]   I would just like to point out that I have watched to it when Leo's with all male guests
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   and he's a different guy.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.360]   I know.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   I know.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.000]   You guys soften me.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.920]   I would never admit to this with them.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.680]   This show is Leo's favorite side.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   Yes, my favorite.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   I was showing the feminine side of him.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   Love it.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.400]   Now, so that's the question.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   So, you know, it's interesting.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.720]   We were trying to decide who covers this.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.000]   There was a battle between iPad today and all about Android.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.120]   And then Eileen said we're covering it and that's all there is to it.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.800]   So all about Android will cover it because it is-- I guess it's an Android device.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   But I mean--
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   You're rooting it.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   I mean--
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.360]   Yeah, now that they've rooted it, I think you win the argument.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   Yeah, that sounds like the right decision to me.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.000]   Nothing against I've had today.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.360]   I like Time Warner is now going to block this because they think there might have been something
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.400]   in here that was theirs.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   So--
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.480]   Yeah, I don't like this cover flow absorbs everything you've ever done.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   I mean, the UI--
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.960]   Is there a-- is there a-- is there a-- you want to change that flow to a different UI?
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.120]   Will this sort of it?
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   I heard no.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.760]   No, I don't think Dr. Momsman is complaining about that.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.480]   You can search-- well, that's interesting.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   This is interesting.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.320]   Let's see if a web search goes-- oh, look at this.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   This is interesting.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   So you could choose the search sources.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.560]   Amazon, Facebook, Google, Yahoo.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   So that's--
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.000]   So that workflow interface is the home screen.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.840]   There's no home screen popper.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.320]   No, this is interesting.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   But then you have this--
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.320]   Your stock.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.680]   This menu bar, Newsstand Books Music Video Docs.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.760]   Now, Docs is interesting because I don't know how I would create a new Doc.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.800]   In this case, the only Doc is the PDF that's the user's guide.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.480]   You can email PDFs to your Kindle.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   That's right.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   So I guess that's where these would go.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.960]   Just an update, the Google event.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.400]   I'm seeing-- I'm seeing this right now.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.240]   Ooh, it must have to do with music.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   Well, let's tell you what.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.440]   Let's take a break and come back.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.640]   We will go live to that when it happens and talk about it.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.080]   And we do have some other news.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.320]   So including, by the way, Ice Cream Sandwich source code released.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.400]   And because it's in the source code tree, that means honeycomb is been released in source.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.880]   But I want to ask Gina what the hell that means.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.560]   Before we get-- is it good?
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.560]   Is it bad?
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.560]   Is it open source?
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.200]   Let's talk about that in just a second.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.360]   And yes, we will have live coverage of the Google event, which is about to start in about
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.840]   15 minutes.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.640]   Until then, I have commercials from every show except this show.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   Here we go.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   Here we go.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.800]   Let's talk about go to meeting the folks at Citrix produce.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   I just found this out.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.560]   They consider this their premier product.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.120]   I guess it's one of their oldest products.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.920]   And of course, it's one of their most used because nowadays with work groups spread out
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:42.760]   all over, clients all over the world, colleagues to online meeting, it's the best way to meet,
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.280]   to have an impromptu meeting.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.160]   And now because of HD faces, that could be a face-to-face meeting.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   I just love this.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.400]   I want you to go to go to meeting.com.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.040]   It's the offer code Twig to try it free for 30 days.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.120]   It's of course screen sharing for online meetings.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.320]   And very easy to set up.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.800]   It includes voiceover, internet, and teleconference bridge.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.880]   So if they're using their iPad, for instance, they can hear the meeting, they can speak to
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.400]   the meeting without any phone line, they just use their internet connection.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:17.520]   And now with HD faces, the people on PCs and Macs with cameras can now be seen.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.920]   I mean, that makes a huge difference in a meeting to see your clients' reaction to
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.400]   your presentation, to see what your colleagues think.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.520]   They've also made it possible to do this on Android phones and iPhones.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.880]   You can't send the video yet.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.960]   They're working on that.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.320]   But you can attend these meetings on even Android phones and iPhones.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.400]   And that is fantastic news.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.800]   That means no matter where you are, you can be at a go to meeting meeting.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.480]   It means it's easier to get these teams together to get them working together, to see them,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.720]   to interact with them.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.800]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.840]   You may have tried other meeting software.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.760]   Please do not let that poison you.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.000]   This is so much better, so much faster, so much easier.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   In fact, it's so easy.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.200]   You'll just use it all the time.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.280]   It will become your de facto standard for meetings.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.040]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.480]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   And we thank Citrix so much for supporting all of our shows, one of our oldest and most
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   beloved advertisers.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.560]   Offer code TWIT or TWIG.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.120]   Oh, did I say TWIT?
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   I meant TWIG.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   Thank you for correcting me.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.560]   Of course, we want credit for TWIG.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.560]   TWIG, not TWIG.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.560]   Yeah, give us credit.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.560]   You know, it's not...
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.920]   We don't do what they call pay for click ads.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.960]   We don't get paid if they put TWIG in and not get paid if they put TWIT in.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   It's all...
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.840]   That has nothing to do with that.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.880]   But they like to keep track of which shows do best for them.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.680]   And so if you like this show and you saw it on this show, do use TWIG so that we get...
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.280]   We want to be like soupy sales.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.720]   Call your congressperson.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.360]   Use the TWIG offer code.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.760]   Go into Go and demand my book and send us a dollar, kids.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   Yeah, go to Daddy's wallet and find a buck.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.880]   Ten recent algorithm changes.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.640]   Google just constantly working on their algorithm.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.720]   This is from the official Google search blog.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   They have added...
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.680]   I mean, we've heard about the...
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.520]   We talked about it in fact last week, the new algorithm that makes it more up to date.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.360]   But apparently they say they do over 500 changes in any given year.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.440]   This is just the last couple of weeks cross language information retrieval.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.360]   Snippets with more page content and less header menu content like that.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.880]   Better page titles and search results by deduplicating boilerplate anchors.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.600]   Length based auto complete predictions in Russian.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.840]   That doesn't help me.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.600]   I love reading through change logs.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   It's just an epic journey toward...
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.880]   I'm glad that's somebody's job and not mine.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   How about...
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.480]   You know, I met the guy who does the Polish localization.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.840]   I think it was Polish of Google.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.920]   He works out of the Dublin office.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.640]   And so he says, "I'm the Mac cuts for Poland."
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   Somebody's got to do it.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.160]   And Matt doesn't read Polish.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.640]   So extending application rich snippets.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.160]   Rich snippets for applications.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.680]   Oh, that's a neat.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.880]   That's that snippet thing we were talking about with Google+.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.640]   Retiring a signal in image search.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.200]   Fresh or more recent results this we've talked about.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.080]   Refining official page detection.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.720]   Now this is interesting because how do they know what's an official page?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.600]   If you type in Ford, what's the official Ford page?
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.400]   So they've improved that.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.480]   So which pages are official, which pages are fan sites?
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.800]   That goes to our Google+ stuff last week we were talking about about how to know the
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   brands are there.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   Yeah, and I'm sure Google+ kind of ties into this.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.280]   I would think so.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.720]   Yeah, that would be a signal.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.640]   Improvements to date restricted queries.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.120]   And prediction fixes for IME queries.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   You know what that means?
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.240]   Queries that have non-Latin characters.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.360]   So those of you who speak Latin, this isn't for you.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.600]   I like to see Google be transparent.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.160]   I happen to really love reading through chain fonts because it I mean it's a little boring
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.880]   but you can kind of see what some of the thought processes are and the directions that you're
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   heading in.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.400]   I like to see Google being more communicative and transparent about what they're doing with
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   their algorithm.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.600]   Remember back in the day when you had no idea about the magic that was going on behind
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   the scenes?
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   This is good.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   I agree.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.960]   Hey, let me ask you about this open sourcing as I was going to but I forgot of Ice Cream
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   Sandwich.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.760]   That was fast because Ice Cream Sandwich is brand.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.000]   We haven't even seen a phone with it yet.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Right.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Yeah, it was pretty fast.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.800]   I mean Ice Cream Sandwich is kind of that honeycomb was this weird bridge that never really got
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.440]   released and Ice Cream Sandwich includes honeycomb.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.600]   So you can say that Ice Cream Sandwich is really fast or really early or you could say
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.800]   the honeycomb is just really late.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.400]   You can look at it either way.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   So yeah, this is really cool.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.120]   So Ice Cream Sandwich source code is open source.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.040]   So everyone knows that Android's open but the conventional ways that open source projects
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.360]   work is that you can see nightly commits.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.960]   And that's not the case with Android.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.720]   Google works internally and in private on Android up until a point at which they release
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   the source.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.440]   So that's why some say it's not really open source because you can't watch the commits.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.440]   Right exactly.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.200]   Some open source advocates say that it doesn't qualify as a true open source project because
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.760]   you don't see the daily commits and the daily work.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.240]   So that's a matter of opinion.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.120]   To me open source is open that's out there and open and now it is.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.480]   I mean there was a time when honeycomb wasn't out there and Ice Cream Sandwich wasn't out
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.760]   there but now it is.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.480]   The interesting thing is people said oh they'll never release the honeycomb source but in order
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.800]   to release the Ice Cream Sandwich source they have to release I guess they've released the
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.280]   whole like is it get that they use the get tree and then you'll see everything even all
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.240]   of the commits prior to Ice Cream Sandwich you'll see honeycomb.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.480]   Now they say you could use it but don't.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Right.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:05.800]   Yeah from what I understand the Ice Cream Sandwich is based on the honeycomb tree right.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.960]   So it's all one tree.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.960]   Right.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.720]   So all the source code has come out but new developers should develop at the top of the
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.640]   brand you know the top of the trunk right which is Ice Cream Sandwich and not develop
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   on honeycomb.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.560]   This is great news great news for developers is great news for users especially power users
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.960]   because that means that custom ROMs can get developed for Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.120]   It means that the next Kindle Fire or whatever that new Android device is can be built on
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.440]   Ice Cream Sandwich instead of you know earlier versions and it just means that the source
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.360]   code is out there for people to look out and start developing on and you know more eyes
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.640]   is a good thing in terms of bugs and development.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   And so this is great.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.880]   So the source code came out before the first device run.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   Isn't that amazing.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.040]   That's the first time that's happened.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   That's good.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.040]   Source.android.com.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:58.360]   And they you know they give you full instructions for doing it and doing the whole thing and
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.320]   you couldn't be easier.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.080]   And once you have the whole cold base you can make your very own.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.600]   Build your own kids it's easy.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.400]   They do use Git.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.360]   I mean this is the open source project so you're not going to get things like the market
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.000]   or Gmail or maps which are you know closed source apps but but this is fantastic for
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.680]   this just means newer Android devices are going to are going to be running Ice Cream
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   Sandwich upgrade.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   It's good.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.240]   I just think it's a great answer to all the people who were saying after Honeycomb was
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   not released.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:34.520]   Oh you see they know this is not really an open source project.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.240]   It is it is and I and I think that I applaud them.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.460]   I mean better to have it this thought even if it's not pure isn't let's not get our
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.600]   nickers and knots and let's take what we can get.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.560]   You can't you can.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:52.040]   I mean let's talk about pure isn't there's no nothing more pure than an open source advocate
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.640]   and and and there's just no you you will always be something.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   So you know there you know they've they've they've you got the source code.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:06.440]   Did you know that there is you probably knew this the secret Google lab Jeff.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.880]   Oh I never knew about it but I love this idea don't you.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.640]   I love it a few ways I love it and they you know Google mysteries are fun thing they're
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.240]   going to make you know robot cars but I also love it the idea that this country needs a
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.440]   Bell Labs again.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.560]   So what is Google X?
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.320]   Google X is supposedly working on projects we don't know what it is but you know the Google
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.400]   refrigerator the you know the Google cars.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.680]   It's space elevator and if you look at the video that I put up on the rundown there Leo
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.000]   you'll find out other projects that the Chinese have found out about the Chinese know I guess
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.440]   it's a Google to tell us.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.080]   So if you the video there you want to play it.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.200]   Yeah let me see let me see if I can find it where did you where did you stick that right
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.520]   below that on the on the rundown right below it on the rundown and I'm only says Google
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.240]   X got Chinese video I see here we go.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.040]   All right ladies and gentlemen from China comes this video.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:08.600]   Oh this is these these are the technologies these guys Google has pumped out many digital
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.880]   innovations through its Google Labs portal but chose to close it last month.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.600]   I don't know what that meant.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.080]   We don't it's you can't even it's not clear.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.240]   No it's just silly.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.520]   I think it's I think this is a Chinese language news show or something.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.760]   What's the story with these guys there's always do these very cool.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:40.480]   Where the company is working on super secret projects.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.680]   Lots of guys in the lab coats with the I like Sergei and Larry I'm traveling.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   The in the works.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   Our theater and the Android robot taking a space elevator up to the moon where there's
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   a hard rock cafe.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:01.600]   Also looking into robots in internet connected appliances as waste for people to manage their
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.840]   homes from the crowd.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.640]   But from where is Google getting all their ideas.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.680]   This is my favorite part.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   Aliens.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   The aliens.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   So is this a broadcast network in China.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.680]   No no these guys just you ever see these guys make.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   I see them all the time.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   They're like they made the Arieton's slap around fight they do that.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   I would be honored sometimes to be in one of these videos.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.560]   I think we have to do something outrageous so we can get in the video here.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.480]   We want to be in an NMA video.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:51.280]   So there's a story behind Google X explained so that even a small child can get it.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.000]   What is the story with this Larry Page article we talked a little bit about on Twitter on
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Sunday.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.400]   He sounds like a heart ass.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   He sounds like he's trying to be Steve Jobs.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.240]   Is that what I expected to you know Larry Page now CEO he of course replaced Eric Schmidt
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:10.440]   who's been bumped upstairs has he's apparently gotten tough.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.200]   My favorite is the 50 minute meetings.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.960]   You can go to the bathroom right.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   No more than 50.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   My favorite too.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.400]   I think all meetings should be held standing up that way they're shorter.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.400]   That'll end sooner.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.640]   I thought it was interesting that he said that he'd rather decisions get made quickly and
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.440]   then risk making the wrong decision then then drawing it out.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:36.600]   That's a reasonable response though to Google's kind of overly maybe processed decision making
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   right.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   Absolutely.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.360]   He's trying to snap it up but this is a fair I think is this I think you know and remember
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.920]   Steve Jobs did give him advice for a long period of time.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.840]   This is very job zian.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:52.200]   Absolutely it sounds like I mean I think that didn't didn't page say in an interview someone
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.400]   asked what's Google's biggest stumbling block or obstacle and he said Google.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.440]   I mean to me this just read as this is this is a really this is a great engineer who is
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.840]   really excited you know is focused on efficiency and getting things done and he's just frustrated
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:12.080]   with the slowness and the process that's you know just inevitably happens in a huge company.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   A former.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   So good for him.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   It sounds good to me.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.680]   The Times quotes a former Google executive saying when Eric was there you'd walk into
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.080]   a product meaning or a senior staff meaning and everybody got to weigh in on every decision
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.720]   Larry is much more willing to make an okay decision and make it now rather than make
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.640]   a perfect decision later.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:35.000]   He started these changes right away right after he he came in he requires senior executives
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.960]   to show up at headquarters at least once a month for face to face meetings.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.240]   This is very interesting and probably pretty encouraging to somebody who's watching Google
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   closely.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.680]   Yeah I think obviously I think we must have put this out there to say once right show
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.280]   that there really is a grown up a charge now with the strong new direction.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.080]   Right.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:02.320]   Are we as it is two minutes now to two p.m. Pacific time see this right now which is the
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.120]   logo and now what the rumors.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.720]   A little bit of music.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.120]   But this is the same loop that's been going on for a while.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.120]   Okay.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.920]   It's not quite ready and it didn't something kind of leak out or hasn't been been going
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.120]   on already.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.720]   Can you sign up for it or anything like that.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.960]   The idea I think is that they would launch an iTunes like store Sony supposedly involved.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:32.640]   The email that went out to this event feature came from Nigel Tuffnell right.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:38.480]   And of course spinal taps legendary bassist who goes to 11.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.080]   In fact the event is called this goes to 11.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.200]   It'd be great if spinal tap played at the event and if they do I promise you folks we
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.160]   will not interrupt it but we will go live and broadcast.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.160]   We'll sing along to smell the glove.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.120]   We love it.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.960]   Songs and Google music according to Bloomberg will cost between 99 cents and $1.29 very
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.360]   much like the iTunes store but Google may offer discounts like a free song of the day
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.400]   I would expect that Amazon's already doing that of course.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.160]   The question is we heard the talk two weeks ago where you can play a song for a friend.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.080]   This is what I'm really interested in.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.600]   So of course they have to catch up to what the other guys have right but the social part
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.840]   of it this is the thing that I'm really interested in kind of like pages is like I have really
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.360]   high hopes that Google is going to do something interesting and someone said with a twist
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.920]   and we said maybe it's double twist.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.680]   I'm really interested to see if they're going to be built in sharing and how that's going
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   to work.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   That would be really cool.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.680]   Yeah they could do ping right you know ping never really took off the Apple iTunes sharing
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.760]   maybe they could do it right.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.640]   Don't hold out though for share, silo, P Diddy, Gucci Mane, Green Day, the Prodigy or Van
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.400]   Halen they're all on Warner Records which apparently according to some the only major
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   label that hasn't signed but we'll find out I think in just a few seconds what labels
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.320]   are signing up for this so we are going to watch it.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.040]   It's just to check above you Leo look.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040]   Oh nice.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.240]   Wow we are so sophisticated trying.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.160]   So sophisticated this is on the if you want to watch it live without our commentary you
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.920]   can go to youtube.com/android it's on Google's Android channel.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.600]   That would be so dull why would you do that.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.200]   Why would you want to do that when you could have us eventually just life with no commentary
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.960]   should swap us up into there.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.800]   Whoa man.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.600]   No now that oh yeah boy you're good.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.480]   Eileen you've really been practicing.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.680]   I'm not as good as some of the others here but I'm just better.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.240]   She's a virtuoso of the of the turret.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.800]   She's a lot of help but I don't know that was pretty impressive.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Golly.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.720]   I don't know how to do any of that crap.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.960]   So they're still hey hey hey hey.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.760]   I'm kidding.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.040]   Those of you listening at home nothing.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.520]   We'll continue to cover stories until they go live with that salmon Rushdie.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.840]   That's not his real name.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:15.000]   He's of course the author who faced a fatwa for his book the what was it called I have
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.640]   it I read it.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:23.880]   Oh Jesus are we getting older what you are anyway you know what I'm talking about the
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.320]   satanic verses thank you.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.320]   Thank you.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:34.320]   Apparently his real name is Ahmed Rushme Rushdie and and Facebook said well then you
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.240]   have to be Ahmed Rushdie.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.760]   How did they even know that how did this occur that it changed I don't get it.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:45.060]   They deact so he had a salmon Rushdie page they deactivated it and he said and said
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.360]   send us your passport.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:51.000]   Send us a copy of your passport so we know it's you.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.240]   So he did but on the passport it says Ahmed.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   Ahmed Salman Rushdie.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:00.200]   Oh I see and try to get the bit so he got reactivated as Ahmed Rushdie.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:06.000]   He called a salmon Rushdie on his Twitter called Mark Zuckerberg a moron.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.760]   Where are you hiding Mark?
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.560]   Come out here give me back my name.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:19.640]   I love the fact that Salman Rushdie unlike unlike Malcolm Gladwell you know carers about
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:23.360]   social media and was really pissed he didn't have it.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   Good for him.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.360]   Good for him.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:32.280]   But it shows you Facebook has the same issues Google+ does with this whole NIMS issue.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.040]   And Facebook fixed it and apologized pretty quickly.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.920]   After the Twitterverse went crazy.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.800]   We need for these things to happen though.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   I agree.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:47.600]   For these policies to become nuanced and accommodating and reasonable.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.200]   And now we have a name for the event it is not it goes to 11 it's the November 16th event.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.080]   I got no audio or anything it just went to that.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.040]   I like the rocker.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.520]   Wait a minute he's going like that.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.960]   Oh dig it man that's cool.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.560]   That's very cool little antenna hands.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.560]   Okay I do dig that.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:19.720]   Google has solved the problem of collecting data via their wifi Google maps or street
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.240]   view cars that are collecting the wifi stuff.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.240]   There's an opt out feature.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.080]   Do you think they've solved it?
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   Sure this solves it.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:34.080]   All you have to do is add the underscore no map to your SSID and bingo.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.000]   You're out Google will ignore you.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.040]   Come on can we have a good laugh about that.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   Really.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.040]   It could have been worse.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.040]   It could have been underscore no map.py.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.840]   Oh that's true.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.480]   It could have been.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.480]   Yeah wow.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.680]   You think that's not a good solution?
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:57.920]   I think that I found it funny that Google posted this solution in earnest.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   It's basically like robots.txt.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   It's robots.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.000]   Your wifi access point.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   I think it should have been N0 MAP just to make it more elite.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Yeah yeah exactly.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.240]   Because obviously they don't want more confusion between the zero and the oh yeah.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   They don't want anybody to do it so they're going to make it obscure.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.840]   Yeah I would have liked to see them say that you put underscore map if you would like to
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.840]   opt in.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   There you go.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:26.600]   And I wonder how many wifi access point manufacturers are going to name the SSID's underscore no
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   map by default.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.320]   Well it'll break everything right.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.720]   It'll break everything if you do it.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.600]   So they need they want that data and I don't think it's wrong for them to get that data.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.920]   Yeah I agree.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.120]   I'm waiting for Jeff to jot.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.560]   I'm joking of course.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   I just thought that the opt out process.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.120]   Again what's the harm.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.160]   It just goes into all the fear.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.400]   USA Today today had a ridiculous story about discovering cookies and how evil they are
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.800]   and how Facebook tracks you everywhere.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.240]   Of course today you want to say today.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   Tracks you the same way.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.120]   It's like USA to say hey we just read the Wall Street Journal and boy the boy there's
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.680]   a problem out there.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   Cookies.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   Cookies.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.440]   Hey we're going to do a commercial before we go to the event we are waiting for the stage
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.640]   to go live on the it goes to 11 event we expect an announcement from Google of Google
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.520]   Music and we'll continue to cover that bring Tom Merritt in as well.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.360]   This show as always brought to you by our good friends at squarespace.com the secret
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.000]   behind exceptional websites.

[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   easier.

[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:36.040]   I mean really great hosting plus the best contents management system in the world combined
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.120]   together and because they're so tightly integrated you really get the best of both worlds.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.120]   It is not a compromise.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.800]   A lot of hosts have their own site builder software.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.040]   It's junk.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   This is good.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.280]   This is the stuff you want to use and the hosting you want to use.

[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.200]   website and if you have a friend who doesn't have a site or maybe better yet a business
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   you love that doesn't have a site go there said you could just set it up for him real
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.920]   quickly like while you're eating dinner and given the password say here I give this to
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.760]   you and if you want to use it you know go ahead it's yours just it's a nice thing to do.

[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.040]   still like this.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:10.440]   Yeah and I still don't have any audio it's still this.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:20.720]   You know I'm I'm the last person to complain about things beginning on time but it doesn't
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.560]   well maybe there's people I don't know Larry's late I don't know what is there anything
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.560]   on Twitter.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.560]   You want to say Tom?
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   I was going to say once Leo starts complaining that it's not on time you know it's late.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.680]   Tom Meredith of course the chief.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   So bitter.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.880]   The chief victim of my tardiness.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.520]   Tom will be joining us in just a bit as this event.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.320]   I'll keep him waiting.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.440]   Just keep Tom waiting.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.760]   Let's do our tip a number and tool of the week while we are waiting.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:54.000]   How about that let's start with Gina Trappani and her tip of the week.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.120]   Oh sure so this is not new but it's new to me.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:02.960]   I hate getting catalogs in the mail but I love looking through catalogs and there's
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:06.880]   a Google catalogs app which I think came out this past summer but it's a little more useful
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.040]   now because we're sort of getting into the holiday season.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:15.800]   If you go to google.com/catalogs about it's an iPad app for your iPad you've looked through
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.160]   lots of different catalogs and buy stuff online.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.080]   It's just a really kind of nice experience actually it looks similar to the Kindle but
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.600]   what's nice about it is that the catalogs pages are scanned and they have little dollar
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.400]   signs you can tap them and you can buy what you're looking at.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.600]   They used to do this on the web only but now having it in an app is a great idea.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   Yeah having an iPad is really nice.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:33.960]   Can you buy from it?
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.360]   Like can I click it and buy it?
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.280]   Yeah you can right yes you can tap an item you can see details and you can buy it on
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.720]   the web which is super super super nice and along those lines as well iOS folks the Gmail
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.240]   app which was released in the store last week and then quickly pulled because of a bug
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.280]   is back in the app store.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.280]   So you can get that as well.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   And it works nice.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.880]   And yeah it works pretty nicely they still have to add things like multiple account support
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.560]   and that kind of thing but it very much is like the web interface kind of inside an
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.120]   app but it has notifications and a couple of times.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.160]   I think the event is beginning here so Jeff hold that number.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.800]   I thought I will hold the reveal.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.440]   Good tip though I like that Gina thank you.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.000]   Here we go we're going to go to their stream this is at android.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.640]   I'm sorry youtube.com/android.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:27.200]   They've been trying to sign the last music partners that's why they're late.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:35.280]   So what is this music listen can anybody identify this break out the shazam.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.240]   It sounds like Larry noodling.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.720]   It's Paul Allen noodling on his guitar.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.320]   Requiem for Eric Schmidt.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.560]   I'm getting hungry for sushi.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:52.600]   All right we're waiting for the it goes to 11 app event.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.440]   There is a shop tab on Google music right now.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.640]   Oh that's exciting.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.000]   Here we go here we go.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.120]   Here we go.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:10.880]   Remember when your music came on plastic and it revolved around you.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.160]   But lately this is good this is good.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.760]   The play in the cassette they start with an album then a reel to reel now it can set.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:27.640]   Now a CD it seems hard drive to be spinning out of control on computers speaker and be
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.400]   three players.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:40.480]   Phones syncing cancel stop they stopped everything.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:46.400]   And there is a shop button on Google music but it says we're sorry the requested URL
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   not found on the server.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.400]   It takes you to market on Android.com.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.600]   Yeah sounds a little confusing.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.640]   That's interesting though it does sound like it's an android thing.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:59.560]   Ladies and gentlemen now introducing from Google Inc director of digital content for
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.400]   Android Jamie Rosenberg.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:06.680]   It's really a type of applause.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:12.880]   Good afternoon welcome and thank you for coming on what is a very exciting day for Google
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.120]   and I hope for others as well.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.320]   Before we get started I'd like to thank the guys from Monogold a terrific indie band out
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.680]   of Brooklyn New York who kicked it off with that great set.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.000]   You'll hear more about Monogold a bit later.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.520]   Today we're here to talk about music.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:35.600]   At Google digital music has become fundamental to many things we care very much about including
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.960]   the mobile experience, the social experience and the power of the web to improve people's
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.800]   lives.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:49.240]   And for music fans we believe today's technologies including high speed networks, powerful device
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:56.080]   platforms like Android, engaging social networks like Google plus and advances in cloud services
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.200]   bring with them the capability to dramatically improve the digital music experience.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.120]   In fact it's what consumers have come to expect.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.640]   To rewind a few months back in May we launched music beta by Google, a service that allows
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:15.680]   you to store your music collection in the cloud and access that music anywhere from a
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.840]   web browser or Android device.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.880]   Music beta has been a limited invitation only service and we spent the summer learning from
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.280]   the more than one million people who participated.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.800]   We learned that you love knowing that all of your music was available on all of your
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.720]   devices instantly without having to worry about downloading or transferring files or
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.120]   having enough storage space.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.160]   We never could have guessed that.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.240]   We learned that being able to stream your music from any web browser was a big hit.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.960]   You used the service a lot streaming your music for an average of two and a half hours
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.860]   every day.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.800]   We also learned that you really responded to the opportunity to discover new music and
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.960]   add that music to your collections instantly.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.120]   During the beta we've distributed more than 100 million free songs directly to your cloud
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.280]   libraries.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.000]   Finally with the launch and ongoing success of Google Plus we learned that we could make
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.960]   music discovery and distribution social in a deeply integrated way.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:20.360]   Now during this time we've also seen the continuation of a dramatic trend in the mobile industry.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.920]   Back in May we announced that we had activated 100 million Android devices worldwide.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:32.640]   Just six months later I'm pleased to announce that we've already doubled that.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.480]   We have now activated 200 million Android devices worldwide.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.840]   200 million and we're adding 550,000 new devices every day.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.080]   Those are big numbers.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.680]   So during this limited invitation only beta the Android ecosystem has experienced a big
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.200]   increase in the number of active data.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.880]   And now provides unprecedented scale and reach today for those millions of Android
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.800]   devices and for music fans across the web our music beta becomes a full-service.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   The advent of the iPhone.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.840]   And that experience is called Google Music.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:14.760]   Google Music is about discovering, purchasing, sharing and enjoying digital music in new,
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.240]   innovative and personalized ways.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.360]   It's about the cloud, about the web and about mobile.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:27.040]   It's about better connecting you with the music you own and introducing you to new music that
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.160]   we or better yet your friends think you'll love.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:36.840]   Last but certainly not least, Google Music is about artists and their music and new ways
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.320]   to connect artists with their fans.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.000]   Now on my Google Music page it says I had new music from psychedelic indie band Neon
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Indian.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Everyone in the US.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.640]   No invitation needed at music.google.com.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.880]   This is obviously a discovery feature here.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.320]   What about pricing?
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.800]   When we launched the beta we said the service was free for a limited time.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.440]   Now I'm pleased to announce that we're removing that qualification and the service will continue
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   to be free.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   Nice, good.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:07.640]   You can add your entire music collection to Google Music up to 20,000 songs and stream
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.360]   it for free.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.400]   You do have to upload a little song.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.720]   Other cloud music services think you have to pay to listen to music you already own.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   We don't.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Big that up.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.480]   But that's just the beginning.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.120]   To show you the new features of Google Music launching today I'd like to call up Paul Joyce,
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.680]   our lead product manager for music and Michael Soliski, our lead product manager for Android
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680]   Market.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.960]   You're watching the Google Music event.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:38.680]   It goes to 11 announcing a new public version of the Google Music service is free.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.760]   People have responded very positively to music beta over the last six months.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.640]   They like having instant access to all their songs.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:49.400]   The flexibility of streaming or downloading to their devices.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:54.560]   The convenience of being able to play in any web browser, even the one on iOS.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.120]   And they like instant mix, our feature based on machine hearing technology that lets you
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.840]   build great playlists automatically with just one click.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.280]   Now that making the service completely free and opening up to everyone in the US, we suspect
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.320]   they'll like Google Music even more.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.440]   Let's walk through how it works.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.400]   It starts with music manager to help her application for Windows, Mac and Linux.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.640]   But let's you pick which music you want to store in the cloud.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.480]   Even if your collection is spread across several different computers.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:29.320]   When you select your iTunes or Windows Media Player library, all your playlists, play counts
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.360]   and ratings are added along with your songs.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.240]   If you want more control, you can pick by folder and now by playlist.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.560]   And there's even an option to keep adding new music automatically.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.720]   Only Google Music gives you all of these options.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.920]   Once your music is added to your locker, it's organized, secure and available.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   I like that they're demonstrating this on the Mac.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.440]   Not all of your Android devices.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.280]   This really nice HTC MAs by T-Mobile.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.760]   With Michael's help, take a closer look.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.480]   This is the latest music app for Android 2.2 and higher.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:08.200]   Here are all my artists, all my albums, all my songs, all my playlists.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.440]   All I had to do to get access to my entire music collection, even my favorite robots playlist,
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.920]   was signed in with my Google account.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.640]   You can stream anything in my library.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   Please don't.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.040]   Copyright violation.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:33.120]   I like that paranoid Android, this is not less.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   Robot Rock.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.600]   Back in Building 44.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.720]   I want to make sure I have a copy of something stored on my phone.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.200]   For times when my connection might not be so good.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.000]   By the way, this works very well on iOS without an app.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Just to through the mobile browser interface.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.680]   Any albums, artists or playlists I suggest will be available when I'm offline.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:55.200]   Whenever I add an album or create or edit a new playlist, all the changes are instantly
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.760]   available on the web and on my other devices.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.120]   The same is true for my play counts and ratings, another new feature for this release.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:10.280]   We've improved the music app and we've improved music manager and we made the service completely
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   free.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.800]   The biggest change is something we haven't talked about yet and that's the integration
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.560]   with the Android market.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.600]   Jump over to market and take a look.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.240]   This is the Android market.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.080]   The store optimized for the web for the more than 200 million phones and tablets we've
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.080]   activated worldwide.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.080]   Eileen, can you get on the market right now?
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.080]   I haven't been able to get into it.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.080]   It's all billions of applications.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.480]   I don't know if it's already this year we've updated.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.960]   Yes, I'm in it right now.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   Movie rentals and boths.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.160]   Today, we're happy to announce that we've added music and you can buy millions of songs
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.520]   right from my Android market.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.360]   How many millions is the key?
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.360]   This is music.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.720]   That's familiar layout.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.120]   There's genres and subgenres.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:59.760]   This isn't so much a music announcement as it is a music to boost Android announcements.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.760]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   Notice that they're pushing it on as an Android.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.800]   The home of the good music store is one where you walk in.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.560]   Although, of course, it's got desktop.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560]   And you walk out with something you love.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.040]   Actually, how do you want the desktop to go?
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.880]   It's definitely one we aspire to.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   Take, for example, what's on the phone.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.640]   Let me see if the shop link is not so cool.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   Do we have staff picks?
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.800]   It is in the Android market.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   We have promotions.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:30.040]   And then there's content like this profile on Daptone, a really cool retro soul label.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.680]   Together, these features let our music geeks guide you to new music discovery.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.520]   They're anxious to show how much hipper they are.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.480]   Another way we focus on discovery is with recommendations.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:47.280]   On every artist page, our similar artists you might like, making it easy to browse.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:52.240]   And here on the home page, we have personalized recommendations based on your entire collection.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.240]   That's good.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.600]   Not just the music you buy from our store.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:01.080]   We use the same machine hearing technology that powers instant mix to suggest new things
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.760]   we think you're going to love.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.040]   But perhaps the most important way we assist discovery is through friends.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.240]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.280]   What was the trend we were playing last night?
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.840]   The Atlas soundtrack?
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840]   What was the song?
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   Mona Lisa.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   That was awesome.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   Don't act.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   So, is that the ghost?
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.640]   He can search us the web.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.440]   Nothing better than bad acting in an ad search market.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.920]   Doesn't need to search the web anymore.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   That's what's real geeks can't.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.880]   He's really great about our announcement.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.600]   He searches through it.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.160]   Let me tell you about what we're buying.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.320]   Everything in the store is 90 second previews.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:43.000]   And we're also very excited that everything you buy from the store is 320 kilobits per
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   second MP3.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   320 KB per second.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   When you read the transaction.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   The M3s.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.440]   The track is added to your locker without doing anything else.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.880]   It's ready for playback on the web and all your devices.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.520]   That's better than Apple's 256 AC.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.680]   Those are some of the major players in your purchase playlist.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.680]   An Android you'll get a notification.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.760]   But the same, isn't it, as Amazon?
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.760]   Oh.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.480]   But the easiest way to start playing is to follow the listen link that appears right
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.120]   inside market.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:13.960]   Now, if you want to close the circle of recommendation, you can select the share button instead.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960]   And start the sharing process.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.960]   Oh, there we go.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.320]   Let's turn it over to Michael to show you a few more features on the web.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   Share on Google+, and dive deep on sharing.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320]   Friends can't share it.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.320]   You share it.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.320]   You get one play.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.320]   Interesting.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320]   I can't wait to share my Glee music.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   So, here's how much better than school.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.000]   I can't use it.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.800]   And there's a lot of mashup.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.520]   Like everything we sell in the store, it's a high resolution MB3.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.360]   And you can play it here or any of your other devices.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.720]   If you want to download the track, you can do that right from your browser.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:48.480]   Or easier still, you can do it anytime using Music Manager, the same software that you use
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.600]   to add your collection to Google Music.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.160]   Now, as Jamie mentioned, the web player has been incredibly popular during our limited
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   beta.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.240]   And we think it'll be even more so now that we're adding the ability to discover and purchase
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   music.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.800]   So, let's take a walk through the music store and enter and mark it on the web.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.320]   So, we've talked about personalized recommendations based on the music that you enjoy.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.080]   The store is still not live on the web for me.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.880]   Well, it's a tutorial that helps you discover new music.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.240]   No, I do get the EME on Indian recommendations too.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.840]   I guess everybody has to listen to that.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.600]   Every day we'll have a different free song on the day.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.640]   Today we're starting with David Bowie's Sound Envision for thematic reasons.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.240]   You should expect a range from artists you know well to artists you're going to want
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.240]   to get to know.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.240]   The Starbucks strategy.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   You've also got hundreds of other free tracks available now to help jumpstart your collection.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.960]   Every week we'll have a different spotlight artist in our antenna series starting with
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.440]   Caveman.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.720]   And Tenafocus is on emerging artists of all different styles.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   The music of Clea.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   The one thing that they all have in common.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.840]   Christmas, I love Christmas.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.080]   As you browse you also find compelling video interviews and performances.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.760]   Right now for example you can find Merle Hager talking about his years of music making.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:06.960]   I think 320 kilobits MP3 is probably comparable to 256 megabit AAC.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:17.760]   But it plays in everything and I think that that's kind of important.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.200]   Good day to be Neon India.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.600]   Shit that looks pretty well prepared.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   Really pretty.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.600]   Did he just swear?
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.600]   Is your first name?
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600]   Your standard.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600]   That's great.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.040]   That's how much heifer than Apple there.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.560]   My name is pronounced Marlo Zalotov.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.360]   It's like Zalotov.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.760]   But you can do it any way you like or not at all.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.480]   One of the reasons we called our record Marlo Zalotov is because we put that into Google
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.280]   and it had no results.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   She's okay.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.920]   What a surprise.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.320]   S-O for band.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   Marlo Zalotov.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.360]   Nobody ever heard of that.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.200]   I love this guy.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.960]   Mr. Co-Play.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.000]   He's actually from Brooklyn did you know that?
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   No.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.520]   He's just faking access.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.600]   You can hear it in his eyes.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.720]   All this great content is programmed by our team of passionate music geeks.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.000]   They're kind of like know it all record store clerks.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.720]   Yeah, exactly like that.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.720]   Except more on us.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720]   If that's one size of its own.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720]   We can hear artists and out pages.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.520]   You can find all the other features that you'd expect in the music store.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.920]   Artists bios, photos, artists' discographies, album reviews.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.000]   If you had to see anybody sharing anything on Google+ I'm checking it regularly.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Let's play another track.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   Let's see.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   You can show you my own favorite feature.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.240]   The ability to recommend and share what you've just purchased.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.600]   There we go.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.360]   Every time you buy music from the store you'll be able to share it with your friends in Google+.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   Not only will they see it.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.840]   See this is where you really see the Google+ strategy working nicely.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   But don't also receive a free full play.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.480]   Because you don't have a separate ping service.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.160]   It's just get it graded in.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   Not just a limited preview.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.360]   And that's something that no one else has ever done before.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.920]   But didn't recommend and share.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.760]   Right from the purchase confirmation screen.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.960]   Did they have the play it though?
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   I guess if you had a spot.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   So the portfolio of what you have.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   Spotify.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.600]   Spotify you could just listen.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.240]   I get the option to share it on Google+.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.240]   That's kind of neat.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.240]   Look at that.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   That's cool.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.240]   That's cool.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.480]   That's what I want to share it with.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   I like it.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.760]   I can also include email addresses for folks not yet on Google+.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.040]   And they'll receive the same free full play when they sign it.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   Wow.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.680]   Well I want to share a chapter of a book that way.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   I want to share it.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   Yes.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.240]   It's one shows up immediately with my friends' dreams for them to enjoy.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.120]   Oh check out the internal Google header there.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:44.480]   I'm actually making tricks.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.040]   I'm better yet it's not limited to individual tracks.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.640]   When I purchase an album I can actually share the entire thing with my Google+ friends.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   They'll be able to listen and start to.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640]   Wow.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   One full album play.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   Holy crap.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.680]   It's also not limited to the web.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   You can share from your Android device.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   I'm shocked the music in this dialogue.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.480]   You can enjoy the music shared with you.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   That's what Zuckerberg heard.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.760]   That it's proven that it's going to lead to more purchases.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   Right.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.760]   Although it's radio play.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.760]   It is radio play.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.400]   It's been easy to record brand new music store.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.560]   I don't remember.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.200]   Available right now at market.android.com.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.200]   And coming to Android.com.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   If you're going to go that far you'll just pirate it anyway.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   I guess so.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.200]   The music store.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   I want to see how easy they could buy as a version of Android market.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   They've got to make it easy to buy right.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   They should be about to say this by this.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.520]   The web music player live now at music.google.com.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.080]   The smart thing would be to give genius yourself a music.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.560]   Android phones and tablets.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560]   I buy it.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.000]   And available now in Android market.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   And a new version of music manager automatically updating over the next few hours.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.520]   All this is available for US users starting now.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.000]   No invitations required.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.920]   Trying to get my Android download going here.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.800]   So how will a Vine, our director of content partnerships, to talk about the great music
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:14:59.800]   that we have in the store?
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.160]   I would love to be able to make a mixtape.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.600]   I'll play a list of songs.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.600]   That would be cool.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600]   Different tracks.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   That's where Spotify has a huge advantage.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.600]   Spotify is a huge change.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:15.160]   Michael just showed with Google music you can discover new music whether it's chart toppers
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.680]   or hidden gems from less known artists in several different ways.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:24.120]   You can browse by genre or by new releases or by staff picks.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.120]   You can check out Google's social recommendations for you.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.800]   Or even better, you can listen to the tracks and albums that your friends have purchased
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.960]   and sent to you.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.320]   And then you can buy those songs from those very same links.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.560]   We know this is a good idea because they're already bitching in the UK that they can't
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.560]   get it.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.240]   You know, this is very similar to Ping except you're not limited to 90 seconds.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.240]   Right.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   Right.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240]   Does this beat Amazon?
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.000]   Does this mean that this would mean that this would mean that we have great content to
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   better live.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.960]   So I'm happy to announce it to get a terrific set of content partners on Word for launch.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:05.320]   Our partners include major record labels, EMI Music, Warner is missing, Universal Music
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.320]   Group.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.320]   That's the one missing.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   Sony Music Entertainment.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.640]   So they got the big three and independent record labels.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.640]   Many, many independent records.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   Indies are huge.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.520]   Including a beggars group, Merle, CD Baby of course.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.960]   And many, many more.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.520]   And other partners such as Merlin, the global rights agency for independent music and aggregators
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.760]   of independent music such as Iota, the Orchard and in groups.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:34.240]   Collectively, our partners include over a thousand record labels, bringing us authorization
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.200]   to distribute over 13 million tracks from Google Music.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.800]   It's a good number, not 18 million, but it's about 8 million are live today.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.400]   The rest will be adding in the coming months.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.680]   So thanks for your patience as we add new tracks for staff.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   We had a foreign bet.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   They're missing Warner Music.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   That is a fairly large one.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.480]   But recognize how much Google can ever--
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.480]   Who does Facebook have?
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.480]   Who does Facebook have?
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.480]   Spotify.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.480]   Using Androids.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.480]   And to Reach.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.400]   And RDO and Mog and the other ones.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.920]   These partners share our vision of delighting users with innovative new ways of discovering
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   and--
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   So Amazon--
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.920]   To represent--
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.920]   Is 256 kilobits MP3.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.840]   So this does beat Amazon.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.360]   I'd like to invite three music visionaries up on the screen.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   There's a recommended Android market.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:21.240]   If you go in music.google.com and scroll down, you should have recommendations and there's
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.240]   by tab music.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.240]   But you can't--
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240]   It doesn't launch to these--
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.440]   Rob Wells, President Global Digital Business.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.120]   Universal Music Group.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.120]   And Charles called us CEO of Merlin BV, the Global Rights Agency for Independent Music.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.920]   I cannot wait to see that.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.200]   The EMI guy's going to be really nice to the universal guy on stage.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   Thanks so much to have a Mark PB for me and my music.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.640]   You know, it's a real privilege to be able to work with great artists and also to work
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:52.000]   with pioneering new services like Google Music to connect those artists with fans in
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:59.240]   rich new ways and ultimately to tap the immense potential of an online, mobile and social
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.560]   music experience.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.840]   So break a leg, guys.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.600]   I'm Rob Wells from Universal.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:14.160]   I feel with these two guys alongside me, I feel they need to burst into BG covers.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.880]   But I won't.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:24.120]   Universal, we're immensely pleased to be here today.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:31.200]   Doing any deal with Google for the sale of our repertoire is groundbreaking on a number
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.760]   of levels.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:38.240]   We expect this to be a rich new revenue stream for our artists.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:43.800]   We are very excited about the prospect of the global rollout of the platform through
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:51.440]   all Android devices and any new legitimate place to consume music is a fantastic anti-piracy
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   tool.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.200]   So we're very pleased to be here and we wish Google --
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.200]   Interesting that he acknowledges that.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.160]   Of course, that's the stick that Steve Jobs has able to beat them.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.160]   On behalf of the thousands of independent labels that we represent from around the world,
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.000]   we're particularly pleased to see Google launching a music store today and we think
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.880]   it will be a significant new music destination in the digital space.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.520]   We're particularly pleased that Google recognized very early on the commercial significance
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:27.360]   of independent repertoire in the digital music market and worked with us very closely to
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   make sure that the user --
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.360]   Roland's not a label.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.360]   It's a rights organization for independent labels.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:37.800]   So they basically collect royalties for these labels.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.600]   And equally we wish them all success.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.800]   They ask BMI of Indies.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.800]   [ Applause ]
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:48.200]   Except for performance is not public.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200]   Thanks.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   Oh, their performance only.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.200]   They record interesting.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.200]   Interesting.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.200]   Interesting.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.200]   Interesting.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.880]   And of course we anticipate adding new partners as they wish to come on board in the coming
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.880]   months.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   So we look forward to that.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.880]   Warners.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.880]   We are also excited about --
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.880]   They'll get warnings.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.880]   If they've got everybody else, there's no reason for warnings to hold that.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.400]   It's a little added extra incentive to try Google music now.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.840]   We've worked with a handful of artists and their labels to offer some fantastic music
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.880]   that you will not find anyplace else.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.880]   Here come the reviews.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.680]   From each of these artists, we have music exclusively on Google music and including some
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.360]   free tracks to get you started.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.560]   These are artists who are truly excited about the power of Google to bring their music to
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.560]   millions of fans.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.560]   We're going to make these.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.560]   We're going to make these.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.560]   The Rolling Stones.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560]   Huge.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560]   It's for release.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560]   It's key in live concerts.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.560]   This is great.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.600]   I already see add a new and exclusive Buster Rhimes single to your library.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.360]   Thank you, I shall.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.640]   Buster Rhimes playing at the T-Mille event at 9 p.m.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.600]   The band's 50th anniversary here.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.440]   He looks angry about the whole thing though.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   Whole play.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.280]   She curious not to have a TV.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.760]   Interesting they got the stones.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.720]   Stones of course very slow to accept digital music.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.080]   Picking off their Milo's I Love Colton.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.880]   That's a very exciting.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.880]   Be involved in Spotify.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:05.880]   I'm a iconic rapper.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880]   Possibly.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.160]   Yeah, I think the stones also.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.160]   Who's there?
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.160]   An iconic rapper.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.160]   Buster Rhimes.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160]   Buster Rhimes.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   Buster Rhimes.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   He's making all the rounds.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   Where's Gaga?
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.160]   Buster Rhimes.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.160]   All the rounds.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.920]   He's debuting his new studio album exclusively on Google Music.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:25.160]   And the first single from this album is available today for free right now.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   That's cool.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.760]   Yeah, I just downloaded it.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:38.320]   In addition, we have live albums from Pearl Jam, from Shakira, and from Dave Matthews.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.800]   It's not just Buster Rhimes.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.200]   It's Lil Wayne and Buster Rhimes.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.000]   Google Music right now.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   Ooh.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.240]   There's more and I won't get into all the details but please visit our post on the official
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.760]   Google blog.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.040]   And better yet, go to the store and check it out.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.800]   This is, we're really excited about this great exclusive.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.000]   You're in the store on your mobile device?
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.440]   No, I'm on the web.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.600]   I can't get in the store on the web.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.240]   I'm having trouble getting in the store.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   There's one more.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240]   I'm very important artists.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.600]   I'd like to mention a little busy right now.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.160]   To tell you about these artists and how they can work with Google Music.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.960]   We'd just like to ask everybody in our house to stop trying to go to the store.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.600]   And towards engineering, direct cloud services and aspiring rock star.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.600]   Oh.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.760]   Here's the garage band.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.760]   That's right.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.560]   Thank you, Zaha'va.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.720]   Even today's biggest superstars started out.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720]   I want to talk to you.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.720]   I want that to be a short.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.720]   Yeah, me too.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.720]   And right.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.720]   Rock's.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.520]   That community and independent artists is bigger than ever.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:35.360]   And from bedroom DJs creating laptop masterpieces to established acts, putting their next studio
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.680]   recording out, we want to work with these self-released artists who have yet to get
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:46.840]   a label deal to engage with their fans, sell their music while taking advantage of Google's
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.880]   reach.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:53.000]   Built right into Google Music is the Artist Hub.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.600]   A tool that gives you a direct route to distributing music so long as you own the rights
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.480]   to your recording.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.240]   Music submitted through the Artist Hub.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.920]   This is kind of in the music store just like any other album.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.560]   This is very good for the artist.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.560]   Yeah, this is neat.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560]   To make it look great.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.800]   On iTunes you have to do a deal with somebody like CD Baby for this to work.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800]   Really?
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.360]   No, I thought you could submit your MP3's directly to the store.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.360]   Can you now?
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.360]   Yeah, I thought so.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.160]   This sounds more like a built-in garage band.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.160]   Sounds more like SoundCloud.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.720]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   But you couldn't sell it.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.720]   Could you sell it?
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.720]   I don't think you could sell it.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.720]   Really?
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:26.720]   I don't know.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.720]   I'm not hip enough.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:31.240]   A bit of a sneak preview of this to some independent artists.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.240]   Let's hear from them now.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.240]   No, you can't sell it.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.040]   You can only upload it.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040]   Okay.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.840]   So that's actually a big deal, I think.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   It's really exciting.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   It's actually a big deal, I think.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:44.760]   Think about Google and music together because first of all, I use Google every day.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.920]   It's my phone is Android.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.120]   Anytime anyone tells me to listen to your music, I Google it.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:55.120]   This is very big for Google, I think.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:01.520]   Not merely as a music thing, but to really establish them as a social player.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.920]   Which means I've bought it ten, five days a week.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.160]   You end up being your own manager.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.920]   They don't have any other stores like this.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   We drive the van ourselves, I don't drive them, they're allowed to drive.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   We ruin our trailer ourselves.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.120]   I learned HTML two years ago, which was an experience.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.480]   If you're independent, nobody's handing you anything.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.640]   You have to take the time to buy yourself.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640]   Yes.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.080]   I wonder what the tie will be to YouTube and music videos and all that.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.080]   It's really intense.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.080]   Yeah, good question.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.120]   Basically, it's not easy.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.080]   Pump or boost.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   I definitely...
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:45.080]   And you can set your own price, that is a big deal.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.080]   Oh wow.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.440]   What kind of cuts do they get?
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.440]   Directly.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.440]   I haven't said.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.440]   They're not going to say it today.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.440]   We'll find out.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440]   I don't know what to say.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.080]   I'm able to have control.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:02.520]   There's an ad free music link that you can add all the free music in every genre.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.080]   You can really build a library this way.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.920]   Your whole album is for free.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   You can share it with your friends.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.520]   I hope they have creative comments on here too, so you can use them for podcasting.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.520]   Fantastic.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.800]   You have a link on the top of the video sending you right over to people who use it.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.800]   There's YouTube.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800]   That will help the song.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.800]   There's the YouTube connection.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.040]   And an opportunity of exposure without having to think that you need to decide to
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.880]   label music fans don't have to search as hard.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.880]   The heck with labels, the heck with studios, the heck with publishers, the heck with bookstores,
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880]   the heck with a wall.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.880]   Yes, just to center mediates.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   That works.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880]   You need his marketing.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.880]   You're talking like Google that has this...
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.880]   Yep, exactly.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.280]   Well, and YouTube can do some of that, right?
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280]   Well, that's what Google is going to promote, right?
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   And your friend.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   Right.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   Your friend.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   This is great.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   It's the beginning of NASA's search.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.080]   This is a success in the music industry.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.020]   This doesn't happen without Apple dominating the music industry and the music labels saying
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.720]   "We've got to do something about Apple's dominance."
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.720]   Right.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.560]   Because really, this is also slapping the face to the big music labels.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   Yes.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   You're rightly.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   I'll apple to the huge favor.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   Or Google.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560]   Yes.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.440]   And the possibilities that it brings at a large scale.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.200]   Now this is a bit of a new concept for digital retailers.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.920]   So I'd like to walk you through what the experience is like for the artists.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.280]   And when I'm going to do so, I'm going to do so using Monogold, the band that opened
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.600]   us up today as an example.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.600]   So artist pages too.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.600]   That's why they announced brands.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.600]   That's why they announced brands.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.600]   That's why they announced brands.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.600]   There goes my face.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.600]   Their artist page.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.600]   Chills my face.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.600]   Now if it turns out that this is an artist we don't know about yet.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.600]   Music pages live.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.600]   Music pages can create their artist page for $25.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   That's now called Google Space.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:40.900]   Artist registration fee, it basically works the same way as Android developers who want
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:41.900]   to sell their...
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:42.900]   There's the store on the...
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.580]   It is the Android market.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.860]   And the artist page gets started with free music.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860]   It's a good thing.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:48.860]   When they search for their favorite band.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.940]   I have to go check out a Google music store.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.940]   So what we allow them to do is go home and use Facebook.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.940]   Oh yeah, what I saw in books is Monogold, his enterprise.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.420]   There's all the free music.
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.420]   They've uploaded an artist...
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.420]   47 songs.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.420]   Other information about themselves.
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.420]   Earth-rendered fire, bust-to-rise, chris-is.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.260]   And also add web links.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:09.420]   And of course the real benefit here is that artists can actually sell their music directly
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.060]   to fans within Google music.
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.060]   Listen to this.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:18.460]   So to do this, the next step is artists will upload their original content, individual
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.140]   songs or albums.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:24.700]   They set some metadata about it like genre and pricing info.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:30.500]   And then we also allow the artists to control how previews work in the music store.
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:36.860]   So for example, they can elect to enable 90 second previews of their content, full preview
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:42.380]   or even unlimited free plays of their music within the Google music store.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.420]   And of course, like all purchases...
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.820]   It really does replace the Google music store.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:51.300]   Shares to Google+ include a single free play for your friends.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.300]   It's very big.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.980]   Artists keep 70% of the revenue for sales of their content in the store.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:02.580]   And there's no whole per album or annual upload fees required here.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:03.580]   Huge independent musicians.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:07.020]   And that's going to mean that it's really easy for artists to release their music as
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.420]   frequently as they see it.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.420]   That's fantastic.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:15.460]   So in addition to studio tracks, artists can put up demo material...
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:16.980]   Open stars made in YouTube.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.500]   They're very star-baked in Facebook.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.900]   I'm recording from a gig earlier in the week.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.900]   That's a good question.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:24.300]   They can also change pricing or any of the albums they can't...
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.020]   I can imagine somebody going...
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:31.340]   I'm giving them significantly more control over how they distribute their music.
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:36.220]   We're also working with YouTube to allow artists to sell songs directly against their
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.540]   music videos or on their YouTube channel pages.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:43.700]   And we're doing this as part of YouTube's recently announced merchandise store.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.900]   Now, Monogold has set everything up.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.180]   They've uploaded all their content.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:52.580]   So why don't we pop back over to the music store and see how it looks there.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:55.860]   So we're going to go and do a search for Monogold here.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.540]   And when we do...
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:01.380]   You'll see in the search results, they show up with the artist image that they upload.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.380]   Who needs a record company?
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:05.620]   What does a record could they do for you?
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.260]   Artist detail page.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:11.060]   And a little reload between friends is never a bad thing.
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.060]   Exactly.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.700]   And so here you see that their biography information is there as well as the...
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.380]   They add no albums and tracks.
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.620]   And by the way, for the indie artists, you wouldn't have the international restrictions
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.860]   you have for the mainstream publishers.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860]   I wonder if they'll make this...
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.220]   They can go back to the artists...
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.780]   Available globally quicker.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:29.780]   And there's a payments tab where they can monitor their sales and...
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:30.780]   Fantastic.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:31.780]   Boy, if I...
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:32.780]   ...he's not the layouts that they're going to be...
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:33.780]   You're a musician.
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.780]   This has got to be the best news you've ever heard.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:35.780]   From the sales...
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.020]   So if you are an independent artist with original content, we've got your audience.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.260]   The Google Music Store is built into Android market and installed on million Android...
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:48.180]   I'm waiting for the Google AdWords integration.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.020]   So I invite you to come to music?
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:51.020]   No, you're right.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   You know, it makes sense.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.740]   You add if you want to promote your music.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:30:00.140]   And to kick this off, we're excited to have a handful of notable artist hub users on board
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.140]   already.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.300]   So what else could they sell the same way?
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:04.940]   People on top of it.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:05.940]   I do.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:06.940]   I agree with you.
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:10.380]   We've got to see books, magazines, content, all kind of movies, TV shows.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.860]   Well, you can upload your book to the Google Books program.
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.260]   Does that take it into the Android store?
[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.100]   I'm also hoping that maybe one of my favorite...
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:17.100]   Yeah, they have books on the Android store.
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.740]   I'll just drop the share rate and all that other stuff.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.740]   I want to share a chapter of it.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:21.740]   Like that, you know.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.740]   And now we can do that thing.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.740]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:31.940]   We'll tell you about a very important partner in bringing Google Music to fans.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:32.940]   What happens on the iPhone?
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:33.940]   I'm curious.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:34.940]   Thanks, Chris.
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:35.940]   I guess you can't participate.
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:39.580]   We're able to bring Google's music offering to millions of people because of the tremendous
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:45.660]   support we have from the carriers and manufacturers who form the backbone of the Android ecosystem.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:50.940]   Our very first distribution partner for Android was T-Mobile USA, who got this all started
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:54.660]   with the launch of the G1 back in 2008.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:58.860]   It seems fitting then that T-Mobile is with us here today to help us celebrate this exciting
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:30:59.860]   milestone.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:00.860]   It's been quick, hasn't it?
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:01.860]   It has.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:06.700]   And even as it relates to music, T-Mobile is a pioneer with us once again.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:10.780]   We're pleased to announce that coming very soon, T-Mobile customers will be able to pay
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:15.980]   for music purchases directly through their T-Mobile phone bill, as they can do with Android
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:18.140]   market applications today.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:22.100]   For some additional announcements, I'd like to call up Andrew Sherard, Senior Vice President
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.100]   Marketing for T-Mobile USA.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.100]   That's nice.
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:28.580]   That's not everybody who wants to set up a Google Checkout account.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.780]   It was a first mover with Android.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:34.980]   T-Mobile has a deep history and experience working with Google.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:40.100]   Since the introduction of Android, it's been amazing to see exactly how the mobile experience
[01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.580]   has been transformed.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:46.260]   And since that G1 has launched, the Google ecosystem has grown incredibly.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:49.220]   There's not a mobile site for the Android market.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.220]   You know, the network's phones.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.220]   Android market.
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.220]   So iOS.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:53.220]   I guess you could do it on the non-Mobile site.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:55.420]   Today, T-Mobile has the largest selective mobile site for that.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.820]   The T-Mobile device is running on America's largest.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:00.700]   I think they're really saying, "By Android."
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.820]   What's surprising is that, 7-year-olds who got those who got the account is on iOS.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:05.820]   Pardon me?
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:10.100]   Music.google.com has a web app for iOS.
[01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.260]   The mobile site is great and plays and everything.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.220]   But as soon as you go to the shopping experience, you get the desktop site.
[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:19.820]   Because that's the Apple rule.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:22.140]   Amazon can't solve record because it's common.
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:26.260]   Well, you don't have to do it in an app, but you can do a mobile site that's...
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.380]   Yeah, you can do a mobile site, Apple can't stop it.
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.380]   Oh, I see.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:31.100]   I mean, there is no...
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.100]   I don't think there's an app.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.340]   There's no app on iOS for Google Music.
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:37.020]   But the mobile site is so good you don't need an app.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.020]   Okay.
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.020]   See, this is really about...
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:42.020]   I think the reason they chose to do that is to push people to Android.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.260]   Well, there's an independent app called GV.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.220]   This is disruptive to all of media.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:50.300]   And why make that dependent on Android?
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:52.140]   Sure, let it push Android.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.140]   Why not?
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.140]   That's why I said early on.
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:57.900]   Well, because they're losing people that they could...
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.980]   And those people are audience for these musicians.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:04.380]   So the more audience you have to do for these musicians, the more power the...
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:08.340]   Maybe the theory here is isolate Apple users.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.060]   They got iTunes.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.540]   They want to live in that Apple ecosystem.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.540]   We're not going to fight it.
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:14.580]   It could just be development priorities.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.580]   We made the mobile site for Android first.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.340]   We'll get around iOS later.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:21.900]   Well, as I said, they have an excellent mobile site for iOS for the Google Music.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.420]   Yeah, I guess we'll have to take the store here.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.780]   But we know they want more.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.940]   They don't just want to stream music.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.740]   They want to share it.
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:34.380]   They want to discover music and they want to be able to organize it.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.380]   To date, there really hasn't been anything that's done very well.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.100]   I can see that it might be in some companies.
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:41.820]   So what we see is a great-time experience to say us versus there.
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.260]   The music you love with this...
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.260]   I don't think they just want as many people using it as possible.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.060]   And that's where our reliable network really comes into life.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:49.540]   The way they treat a lot of their other things like GV.
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:53.460]   When we combine a fast-wording network and Google Music, we believe this will transform
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:54.460]   the industry.
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.860]   It's a whole new experience.
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:01.180]   Not only will you be able to discover music in a new way, you'll also be able to share
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.780]   those purchases with your friends through Google+.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:06.780]   That is fantastic.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:11.220]   And T-Mobile is going to enhance that experience by running it on our fastest smartphones from
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:16.700]   HTC, from Samsung, and allow people to discover and share music faster than they can even
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.620]   do it at home.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:22.860]   So to celebrate that, I'm happy to announce that we're going to have some free exclusive
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:25.700]   content for our customers.
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:26.700]   This includes...
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:30.740]   Lewis Gray has shared the first song on Google+.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:31.740]   Nice.
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:34.060]   Welcome to the world of Google Music on Google+.
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.060]   Here's a...
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.060]   If you'll pull up my screen...
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:40.340]   Of course, it'd be Lewis Gray who was working at Google+, he's sharing the Daffd Punk
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:41.340]   Tron song.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.340]   We're going to continue to offer...
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.340]   Here's the preview.
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:44.340]   Comments sharing.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:50.780]   We know our customers are going to have a great experience using Google Music...
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.780]   Only one share.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.780]   Across our compelling lineup of Android smart phones.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.740]   You can buy the song and share it again.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:56.740]   Let's see.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.740]   I just reshared it.
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.740]   Let's see what happens.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:34:59.740]   I can reshare it.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   And the boy can...
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   Look at that.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   Look at that.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.740]   Aw.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:07.540]   Thanks very much, Andrew.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:11.820]   So with that, let's recap what we've discussed today.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:16.820]   Worldwide Android activations now stand at 200 million.
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:22.700]   The music beta cloud service becomes Google Music, opens up to everyone in the US, and
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:28.020]   will store and stream your music for free up to 20,000 songs.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:32.340]   The new music store in Android Market allows you to add to your collection with millions
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:38.300]   of songs, personalized recommendations, rich editorial content, and lots of free songs
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.260]   to get you started.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:46.540]   The store launches today on the web at market.android.com and rolls out to Android devices in the US
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.540]   over the next day.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:49.180]   But basically, the thing you share is listen to previews.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.380]   Any song or album you purchase in the music store...
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:53.380]   I can't listen to the whole song.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.380]   Ah, you're right.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:56.380]   I thought you were supposed to...
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.380]   That was key.
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.380]   I think it was the whole song.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.380]   Well wait a minute.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.500]   I see listen to preview here too.
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.500]   Maybe the preview is one...
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.500]   How long is the preview?
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:05.500]   I thought the artist sets it.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.500]   Yeah, the preview is only 30 seconds on us.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.500]   No, they set one full play.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.500]   That's a mongrel play.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.940]   Is that bad word either or is that...
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.100]   Hey chat rooms.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.100]   Somebody play one of those things.
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.100]   It's 30 seconds.
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:18.100]   I can see it.
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.100]   It's only 30 seconds.
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   Wow.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.100]   Come on guys.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.100]   That's just a bug.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:24.100]   That's not an issue.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   And finally...
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:28.100]   Because they did say full song, right?
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.100]   They did.
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.660]   I'm seeing other shares that say listen once for free.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:32.660]   So that must be...
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:34.660]   Is it your re-share that's my first song?
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:35.660]   No, no, no.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.340]   Because Lewis Gray's was...
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.620]   Okay, let me re-share Christina Warren film girls.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:43.660]   So she has a listen once for free.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.020]   Let me re-share that.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.100]   Yeah, it looks like it's going to do the same.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.780]   It's going to be listen once for free.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.300]   So it's just you re-share what the person shared in the first place.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.420]   So yes, it does work.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.420]   Yep.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.460]   Okay, now I have to delete this.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.500]   Otherwise I'm spamming everybody.
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.820]   I think that's it.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.900]   Well, very interesting.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:07.100]   I think a very significant announcement from Google, music.android.com.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:10.660]   It's the Android marketplace which shows you that they're really focused on the mobile
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:15.740]   side of this as much as the desktop side of this.
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:16.740]   And social.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.100]   And social is huge.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.780]   This is what Google had promised with Google+, they said.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:24.420]   Google+ will be an experience across all Google platforms.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:29.860]   And by turning it on in its biggest way so far with Google Music, they get a double bang
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:34.100]   because of course that's a great way to launch a service like Google Music.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.500]   And it really pushes people towards Google+.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.860]   Yeah, this is huge.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:41.060]   This is going to sell a ton of music.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.940]   I mean, it just is.
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.300]   I can't wait to get my hands on the API for this.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:50.180]   I want to say, give me all the tracks from my friends which I haven't listened once yet
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:51.180]   to.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:55.060]   And I want to see their faces next to them and I want to know who the people who I've
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.620]   bought stuff from the most, who are my music muses.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.860]   I just think this is great.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:04.860]   And I love to see anything that helps us get toward fewer Britney Spears and more Jonathan
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.660]   Colton's I'm all about.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:11.860]   And I really feel like the focus on the indie artists is very much in the spirit of YouTube
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.940]   and independent content creators.
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.420]   I think MySpace is going to not going to be the place.
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:20.540]   I mean, MySpace is still the place for bands to post tracks.
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.580]   I mean, my 13 year old nephew is in a band.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:25.260]   He posts his tracks to MySpace still.
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:27.180]   So this is really, really interesting.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:28.180]   And I love who they're trading.
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:29.340]   Now we can promote them.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.660]   Now we can do so much more, right?
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:31.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.420]   And it's interesting how they're treating musicians like developers, you know, that
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.500]   you're kind of going to have that same, that artist hub experience is a lot like the
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.580]   Android market experience for developers.
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:45.740]   So we have that one time fee to pay to set up an artist's page is, you know, one time
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:50.340]   and then you determine how your content gets previewed and what your price is.
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:52.020]   I mean, that's, that's, that's really cool.
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.420]   Developers are talent.
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:54.580]   They're creative talent, right?
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:59.780]   I've been telling my agent at ICM that they should be, they should be representing developers.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.140]   Oh, I love it.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.140]   Very interesting.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.580]   Yeah, that is really interesting.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.700]   So now, I mean, you know, you want to see this kind of thing for authors, for filmmakers,
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:11.460]   for, you know, for, for zine, for people who make zines online.
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:13.260]   I mean, this is, this is, this is awesome.
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.260]   I'm really excited.
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.580]   Down with the mediators.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.340]   Down with the theaters.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:22.180]   Well, in a way, a Google is a mediator, but a, but a generous mediator, right?
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.740]   They're still taking 30% here.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.540]   Well, they're, they're the centralizer, right?
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:29.740]   I think that's what I like the most about this is I feel like this is a much friendlier
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:32.420]   way to manage my music than iTunes with iTunes.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.420]   It's like iCloud.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.580]   I have to remember, well, some of it's up there in iCloud and some of it's on my device
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:40.100]   and I can't look at it all at once and really know because I have to launch the app.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.100]   This is website.
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.300]   I go to the same website everywhere.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:44.380]   I just feel centered.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.020]   I feel like I've got everything.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:50.500]   It's a much more contained universe to live in and it's very attractive to me.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:53.540]   I'll have to play with it and see, you know, I've been playing with the beta, but let's
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.180]   see if I could live inside of it.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:00.820]   But for some reason, this strikes me as just a easier way to keep track of all the music
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:01.820]   you own.
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:02.820]   That's Tom.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.980]   We're going to go to TNT in a moment and wrap up this week in Google in a moment.
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:07.580]   Before we do, I want to take a break.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:11.260]   When we come back, we'll summarize what we've just learned.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:17.780]   I think a very important announcement from Google Music.android.com and Google Music
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:18.780]   now goes public.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.460]   For those of us who've been using it in beta, and I think that's all three of us, it's been
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:26.900]   a great service, but with the addition of a store and all the labels, but Warner Brothers,
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:32.060]   I think this is a very significant move by Google into the music space.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:33.700]   We'll talk about it more in just a second.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:37.940]   However, we do though, I'd like to mention that Ford is sponsoring our shows.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.460]   As always, we love Ford.
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:40.460]   I love my Ford Mustang.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.740]   I bought it two years ago.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:44.100]   You know, I think it's time for another Ford.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.100]   Maybe that electric focus.
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:46.300]   I'd love to get that.
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:54.420]   One of the things that's new in the new Ford 2012 Ford Focus is this Wi-Fi access hotspot.
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:55.780]   Very, very cool.
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:59.900]   You plug in a 3G card into the USB port and you're in your Ford, and all of a sudden,
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:03.580]   your car is a rollin' Wi-Fi hotspot for up to five people.
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:04.860]   There's so many great features.
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:08.460]   The new My Ford Touch, they're going to be rolling out upgrades to everybody who has
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:09.460]   it.
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:10.900]   Beautiful new user interface.
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:14.700]   The app link that lets you control smartphone apps with your voice, keeping your hands on
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:16.340]   the wheel and your eyes on the road.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.820]   And of course, the technology that goes into the powertrains, the engines, the plug-in
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:27.860]   hybrid electrics, all electrics, the bliss system that monitors your blind spots, the
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.220]   active park assist.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:36.100]   These are high-tech vehicles.
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.380]   I can tell you as if I'm a Ford family baby.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:42.820]   As a Ford owner, I want to welcome you to the Ford family.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:47.180]   Join the Blue Oval and get yourself a Ford Drive 1 today at a Ford dealer.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.380]   You visit it online at Ford.com/technology.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.860]   Ford, we love you.
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:57.860]   Thank you so much for making it possible to do what we do here at this week in Google.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:02.540]   So I think a very exciting announcement, but pretty much what we would have expected from
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:04.380]   a Google.
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:07.020]   The details are 70/30 split for artists.
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:11.820]   The very important note that you don't have to have a record label to sell your music
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.500]   on Google's music marketplace.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.860]   You can have absolute parity with Coldplay and everybody else as an independent artist,
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:24.020]   uploading your music, creating a page, setting your price.
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:29.420]   This is huge, really universal marketplace for independent musicians.
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:30.740]   I think that's exciting.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:33.660]   There is of course a lot of disappointment in our audience because we have a very international
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:35.980]   audience that it's available to US only.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:41.500]   That's absolutely to be predicted because of course every record label has its own national
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.780]   interests and you have to do a deal with every country individually.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:49.820]   It is, I'm sure, a matter of time, Google being one of the most international companies
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:52.940]   out there before Google makes this possible all around the world.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:56.340]   But they've got to get the record companies to go along.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:59.580]   So far they've got them all except Warner Brothers here in the States.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.900]   So even in the US we can't get the full feature set.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.700]   They said 8 million songs available today.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:08.460]   They plan to get to 13 million in the next few weeks.
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:14.700]   They will roll out an updated Google market app for the Android phones that will feature
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:15.700]   music.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.980]   They don't yet.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:24.100]   Presumably they will do something for iOS, although right now iOS is left out in the cold.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:26.460]   It took a while before Google Music worked on iOS.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.700]   It just may be a matter of time.
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:29.700]   Thoughts, Gina?
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.340]   You said you're excited about an API.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:34.260]   They didn't announce an API but you're pretty sure they'll have one.
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:39.340]   Oh yeah, I'm sure that the current Google+ API has support for lots of different kinds
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.580]   of actions and pieces of content.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:46.420]   So I'm sure that sharing a music track, like sharing a circle or sharing a video is just
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.740]   one of the different kinds.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.660]   So they've become a slow with Google+ API so far but I'm pretty confident that that's
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.660]   going to come out.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:57.740]   It'll be interesting to see how the DRM bits of that, you know, limiting to one play,
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.620]   per friend, how that's going to work in third party apps.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:03.180]   But I'm sure that we'll see that soon.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:09.980]   And Jeff, you're excited but you would like to see this kind of store and sharing extended
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:11.180]   to other forms of media.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.420]   Yeah, I really think it's a model for that.
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:17.700]   Darity is I'm in Canada right now where my book's not for sale and I can't get it as
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.140]   music because I'm in Canada.
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:24.500]   But yeah, I think that in general, you know, if you're an independent artist, this becomes
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:27.700]   a new way to sell whatever you do.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:30.860]   And you know, people accuse me of being against paywalls for content.
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.860]   I'm not.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:32.860]   I'm formal.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:35.660]   I'll sell you my book if you can only get it in the store.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.300]   But you wind.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:40.100]   But you know, it's hard to do that.
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:41.300]   It's hard to make it happen.
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:46.740]   If you have these easy mechanisms to sell things to people, we'll be able to sell more
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.740]   things.
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:50.820]   And more important that by far is to maintain a bigger price.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:54.660]   Believe me, I don't get 70% of the cover price of a book.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:55.660]   No way.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:56.660]   Or for someone.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.620]   You're like, you get 5%, right?
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.620]   Exactly.
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:05.500]   And so the idea that the creators can now be in more control of their world becomes really
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:07.500]   exciting.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:12.500]   Best deal I ever got, I think it was 15% of the half the cover price.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.580]   So the equivalent of 7.5%.
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:16.580]   And that's very unusual.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:20.660]   10% to 5% to 10% of the cover price.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:25.180]   Because of course, the publisher doesn't get the full cover price, just half of it.
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.180]   It's pretty typical.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:28.180]   So getting 70%.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.180]   It's awesome.
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:30.660]   It's a bit harder.
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:33.740]   And I'm sure it's the same for music, better even for musicians.
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.620]   I mean, they get robbed routinely.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:43.140]   The days of Anetta James signing over the entire value of her catalog for a bottle of whiskey
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.660]   and a cigarette are long gone.
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:46.660]   Thank goodness.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.300]   So, Ap, yeah, yeah, there's new mechanism to distribute.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:54.020]   There's new mechanism to recommend through sharing, which I think is critical, both here
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.380]   in Google and at Facebook.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:00.420]   The new means to distribute things with your new fire.
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.940]   All of this is just tearing the rugs out from underneath the mediators.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:04.940]   And you know what?
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.100]   They all deserve a God bless them.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.460]   God, you want to stop.
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:11.460]   Come on, you want to stop?
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:16.020]   That's to me, the most exciting part of this announcement is the fact that an independent
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:20.860]   recording artist, there are so many great musicians in this world who do not have a record
[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:23.820]   deal who will now be able to have parity.
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.820]   What?
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.820]   Right.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:26.820]   Huge.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.900]   And I think of my son who loves music.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:33.780]   And I'm glad that he's growing up in a world where he'll have a chance to sell his music.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:34.780]   It's fantastic.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:36.180]   You want to stop online piracy?
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:38.220]   Don't break the DNS system.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.220]   Encourage this.
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:40.220]   Thank you.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.420]   This is Internet censorship day.
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:45.100]   If you haven't called your member of Congress, it's not too late.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:51.140]   Go to EFF.org and all the information you need to fight SOPA is right there.
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:59.180]   Just click the website, blocked button, put your zip code in, and they will give you the
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:03.460]   email address and more importantly, the phone number of your member of Congress.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:07.180]   And do call your member of Congress today, your representative and your senator.
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:12.980]   Tell the representatives that you want to stop the Stop Online Piracy Act, SOPA.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:17.580]   Tell your senator you want to stop, protect IP and that you care about a free and open
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:18.580]   Internet.
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:23.100]   Very, very important to let them know on this day, Internet censorship day.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.460]   TNT is up next.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.940]   Tom Merritt with Tech News Today.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.820]   And I'm sure there'll be lots more coverage.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.620]   Thank you for joining us for this week in Google.

[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:34.700]   He's in Toronto right now.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:36.260]   You want to plug an event or anything?
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:37.260]   You're going to go on.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.260]   It's already sold out.
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:39.260]   Oh, that's of course.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:40.260]   Why would it be?
[01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:43.620]   But thanks to the nice third Tuesday, folks, who did this in Toronto tomorrow night and
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.620]   Ottawa on Friday night.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620]   Awesome.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:46.620]   Awesome.
