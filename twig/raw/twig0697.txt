[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Yes, another three hour marathon. But of course,
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.320]   we're going to talk when we get Glenn Fleischman here from Glenn.fun and
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   Mackerel Magazine. We've got Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   Aunt Pruitt from Hands On Photography, Stacy's on assignment at CES. She'll join us Sunday on Twig.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.360]   Get ready everybody. It's fast at your seat belts. You might want to go to the bathroom before the
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:42.640]   show begins. Twig is next. Podcasts you love. From people you trust. This is Twig. This week in
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.720]   Google, Episode 697, recorded Wednesday, January 4th, 2023. Don't track me bro.

[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.360]   It's time for Twig this week in Google for a show of 2023. I am back from the tropics.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I bought this hat on the beach. Do you like it? Join it. Stacy's not here. She's at CES, but Glenn
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.160]   Fleischman. Because of that hat. She do even wear that hat. I'm not going to be associated.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.120]   Maybe nowhere near it. Glenn Fleischman is filling in. It's great to see you Glenn from Glenn.fun,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.640]   Jeopardy, champion, wore this shirt in honor of Aunt being on as well.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.520]   It's got a camera. It got box cameras on it. That's a camera. Very cool. Favorite gift
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   of 2022? Oh, you got it for Christmas. Sound nice. By birthday, I've been wearing it for months.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.120]   And Pruitt is also here. He's our favorite gift of every year. Hands-on photography,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.440]   community manager at Twits Discord and the Klobyser. You had a lot of help questions over
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   the holidays, I think. Thank you for doing it. Yeah, I saw that, but we were off.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840]   So I am just now trying to get to those and address them. But if you had any problems
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.120]   during the holidays, tough luck, buddy. How would you like a nice Hawaiian punch?
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.480]   Also, I've answered every way. Also, with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Wait a minute, wait a
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.040]   little. Hello, hello, hello. Happy new year. I did the prompter for this one. He's the director
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.720]   of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Newmark Graduate School.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.720]   Journalism at City University of New York. Hello, Jeff. Oh, welcome back.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.200]   Do you have a good holiday? Yeah, yeah. Anything special during the holiday?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.920]   I enjoyed watching the year-end compilation, which was funny laughs.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.640]   Yeah, you and Glenn were going back and forth on the old Mastodon.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.720]   Yeah. About that. Good. Good. I'm glad you enjoyed it. The world, the best world.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.400]   We haven't used the moral panic thing since. I think we can institute that.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.000]   All right. Well, Mr. Pruitt's here. He's got it. He's got his finger.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.120]   The foist. The moral panic. Over the moral panic button.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.120]   Oh, okay. Somewhere. Oh, yeah.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.960]   What is though? This is the one. No, no, no. This is the one where I go dancing across the screen.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.800]   Oh, we need that one. That's built in to the show itself. We have to save that.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:50.240]   There it is. I got a bad feeling about this. There we go. Wow. Did Anthony Nielsen do that?
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.600]   Must have. That's the one he doesn't try. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.800]   That and more in the year-end show. You still watch it. Oh, yeah. It's good.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   It's good all year. It's pretty funny. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Stacy's at CES, but that's the
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.400]   good news is she's going to report back on Sunday. She'll be on the big show this week at Tech.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.920]   And I'm trying to get her to file something from CES for our brand new Ask the Tech guy show,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.760]   which makes it say debut at 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern on Sunday. The replacement for the
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.000]   radio show. And I was hoping there are a few things she said, "Can you give me an assignment?"
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   So I said, "Well, there are a few things that are interesting at CES. Maybe this one.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:50.320]   The LOL button." So this is a device created by just some guy that won't let you use LOL in a
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.800]   text message unless you mean it. You actually have to laugh into this LOL box. I just appreciate
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.680]   technology gone too far. This is this is this is yeah. I always use L-L-O-L, which is if I literally
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.800]   laughed out loud, I will send L-L-L-L. Well, Brian Moore has made a device which will allow you to do
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.240]   that. He posted a video on something called Twitter. Don't know what that is on Tuesday.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   He says, "I remember when LOL meant laugh out loud, you know, a real chortle. Now it's meaningless.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   Dold down to the mere acknowledgement of a message. So as an artist who likes to play technology,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.200]   this is an article from motherboard on vice. He decided to build the box.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   It listens for some form of laughter. Is there actually some significant AI in here? You can't just
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.280]   go, "Oh, you got to really laugh." And then a message would come on saying, "L-O-L verified."
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   And then you're allowed. Does it cost you eight bucks a month to use them? No, not like the
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.080]   blue chat. No. Actually, I don't think he's selling these, but he says he's going to put the
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.880]   hardware design up an open source that anybody wants to build it themselves, including the software.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.800]   Do you remember the story of David Cameron with the Levinson Inquiry at LOL? No, what was that?
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.640]   He would send emails to Rebecca Brooks, who was a number two to Murdoch and is now back high
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.160]   in the firm after she managed to do her apology tour. And he would always send his emails with
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.360]   LOL, thinking it meant lots of love. Yeah, I remember thinking that too back in the days.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.320]   On the AIM, what was that? Yeah, AOL, Austin Messenger. I remember seeing that
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.600]   from my best friend back in the day. It's like, "Why does it keep saying lots of people?"
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.640]   Jeez. We're buddies in all of these. That's a fun new
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.320]   thing called a "Mondegreen." Right? Oh, yeah.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.440]   Excuse me while I kiss this guy. Yeah, which are miss- I'm misheard lyrics.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.040]   Gotcha. But now we can have misheard, what do you call it, acronym?
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.520]   emoticons. I misheard some things. Yeah. Here's a product brought to us last
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.800]   earlier today on Windows Weekly. This is also from CES called the Mutok.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   This is from a company called ShiftAll.net. It is a microphone you strap on like, oh, that's not
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.680]   it. What's that?
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.760]   Oh, that's ominous. There's a pair of lost patients with us. It's counting down. We have 14 minutes
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.040]   and 10 seconds left until John explodes somewhere in this building.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.920]   Or maybe that's how long I have to wear the hat. I don't know.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.640]   Can you pick up my screen or is that not available? There it is.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.400]   Oh, I have a button I can press now. They've given me a button.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.640]   You're in control. I'm in control. Look at that.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.000]   This is the Mutok. It's a leakage voice suppression.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.120]   Microsoft phone, you strap on like a feed bag.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.280]   Are you serious? Oh, I thought this was a cow translator. You stop it on a cow.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.120]   It looks like you could fill it with oats and you give it to your horse.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.960]   But no, I want to know what the cows say. The idea is it picks up and amplifies your voice,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.520]   but no one outside can hear it. It's for use in VR.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   So if you don't look like enough of a dork wearing your headset and you're
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.040]   Oh my God. You can put this on. Go into a padded room and be done with it.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.560]   My wife has a bone anchored hearing aid and it's got Bluetooth connectivity so she can hear
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.320]   calls in her head, but she doesn't have a sub-vocalization chip yet.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.880]   So is that wild? Is that wild? Yeah, the calls actually are directly transmitted to her.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.760]   Is it like a cochlear implant? It's similar to that, but she's lacking the bones and
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:54.880]   her ear on one side. So it actually vibrates the cilia inside your ear. So nobody can hear what
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.840]   it's saying. And so she can take a call or listen to music in her head. That's cool.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.520]   Oh, I can do that with my hearing aids. It'll pair to the phone.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.240]   Yeah, yeah, that's exactly. Yeah, it's a little weird because I'm talking and nobody
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.640]   knows what the hell's going on. It's good. It's good. I like to hear voices in my head too
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.520]   sometimes without any Bluetooth. That's the case involved.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.720]   Let's see, what else? I can't wait to get Stacey. I have a whole section, as usual with CES.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:32.800]   90% of what gets showed never emerges, right? Here's the bird buddy, a smart hummingbird feeder
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.200]   that will photograph and identify 350 bird species, which is weird because it's a hummingbird feeder.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.240]   You don't love that. Craig's now mini. Craig, new marks, but he loves
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   pigeons. Craig, Craig. The thing is, I don't get it because it's a hummingbird feeder.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.960]   What feeds at hummingbirds? Not pigeons. Nothing but hummingbirds.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   You know, the worst fact I learned over the pandemic relates to hummingbirds. And I already
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.160]   told you this fact is the worst thing. Wow, I don't know what is it? About 70% of a hummingbird's
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   diet is spiders. What? Really? Yep, they mostly eat spiders and they supplement with nectar.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.600]   Wrong with that, my friend. No, it's great. But you look at them a little different. You're like,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.120]   oh man, they'll hover in the tail and go, just sucking. Do they do with their tongue?
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.520]   It's labs. Or they do it when they start to be. They don't think of the
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.680]   their vicious, vicious little birds are beautiful. But now I think of them a little bit more dinosaur
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:36.560]   like. Well, that's what I think about birds is their dinosaurs. And, you know, they can be,
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.080]   you know, vicious. I didn't know this. It is a hummingbird feeder. There are three
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.720]   hundred and fifty different kinds of hummingbirds. Well, there you go. You just don't run out of
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.560]   honeybirds all year long. So you'll know exactly what kind of hummingbird is sticking its peak
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.520]   down your nozzle. You know, I guess that does beat my idea because currently I've set a tripod
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.440]   out on mine. There are cameras. Maybe you use them that are for taking pictures of wildlife,
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:11.920]   right? They're weather impervious and they detect motion. Do you ever use that ant? Or you just
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.880]   know, I don't use that. But my neighbors back in Carolina, they would use those little camera for
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.840]   deer. And you know, we got a family of deer in the backyard. So we sat in one of them back there.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.480]   All rats. Every time they walked by. It took some, you know, like little 12 megapixels photos of them.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.360]   And then they should get a, I got an alert, whatever animals come to my porch. Now I live in,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.120]   you know, relatively urban Seattle. And so, but then it's like, there's an animal at your porch.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.000]   Like, oh, I look, it's just the regular. It's a apples home kit thing. And I'll be like, what
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.760]   animals? Like, oh, it's a cat. Like, oh, like, usually it's like, oh, that's a rat on the porch.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.960]   Okay. Well, thank you for letting me know. It's a UPS guy, you know, it's hard to tell sometimes.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.040]   It's got little bolt-line features. Roku. These are all C. C. S stories formally. The show,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.960]   formerly known as a similar electronic show, which at some point for some reason, the C.E.A.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.040]   the Consumer Electronics Association decided should not be called this consumer electronic
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.440]   show, but just C. S like Elvis. It's just C. S doesn't stand for anything.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:17.280]   Roku is announced. It's going to make TVs. Oh, so it's partnered for a long time with TCL to put
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.840]   Roku in TV. It's about my mom one because that way was easy for the cheap. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.200]   Who's going to make them for?
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.600]   This is one wouldn't think one wouldn't think, but it says,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:40.000]   Roku's, this is from CNET, Roku's first foray as opposed to June foray into TV manufacturing
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   comes in the heels of successful partnerships with TCL, high sense and sharp. Let me see if they
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.920]   mention. Oh, it says, hello, I see. Yeah. I just got my first little Roku box for a long time. I'd
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.440]   one years ago when they first came out and moved on to other stuff, but I got a little of the
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.560]   micro ones for a guest room TV. They're still actually really impressed. Yeah.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.440]   It's very high quality. It's better at a lot of things than the Apple TV for sure.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.720]   And they've got their own programming now and some other stuff. It's such a funny company.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.120]   We're spun off out of Netflix when they were to back us antitrust or something.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.840]   Roku was spun out of Netflix. Yeah.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.280]   I didn't know that. We're good at it.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.200]   The founder, really interesting, very technology guy, he suddenly had to be like a CEO,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.600]   Anthony Wood. Yeah. He's still in charge. And am I remembering that right? I think they were
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.080]   originally a project. It's been off Netflix with 15% equity in Roku.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.200]   Yeah, that's right. I know. Isn't that a funny origin story?
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.040]   Because you sold his investment in 2009.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.280]   It explains why every Roku remote has a Netflix button on it.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.160]   Yeah, it might be pretty. That's a part of the deal. Yeah.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.480]   He was, I mean, Anthony was, I remember seeing him out of C. Yes, in fact, back in, I don't know,
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.520]   2004 or something. And he was very excited about some stuff that felt like it was way ahead of
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.800]   the market, way ahead of the big consumer players. And they're still keeping up,
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.960]   which is impressive, giving that they're competing against Amazon and Apple and some other,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.440]   some other very, very large. I think they win against Amazon anyway,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.280]   because they do the same thing without all the Amazon ads.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:22.800]   I'm actually not tired of my Amazon, the Echo shows, which have a screen because
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.080]   they're show up one of your pictures and then an ad and then one of your pictures and then an ad
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.960]   and one of your pictures. Really? They spent at annoying all months, last month promoting
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:37.520]   Avatar, the new Avatar movie. And they had an avatar, you know, say, hey, just tell a word that you
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:46.640]   want the Avatar theme and all that. And it was like, no, it's just an advertisement.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.960]   I thought you took, I thought you took my aunt for a second when you said, Hey, word,
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.760]   we're doing the same. Yeah, I mean, I need one of these avatars.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.960]   So you used to go to CES, Glenn, have you stopped now?
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.840]   Hi, this embarrassing thing I managed because I've always been a freelancer,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.920]   never a staff member. I self-funded one trip there, got foot sore over a few days, saw a
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.960]   bazillion things and never went back. And I enjoyed it, but I've never had a coverage need.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.800]   And nobody was like, yeah, I want to spend, I don't know, $8,000 to send you to CES.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:25.280]   So I, it's expensive. And loves CES. And every year you ask us, can I go?
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:33.120]   I crowdfunded it one year. The other times I went in freelance with Tech Republic and
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.920]   oh, that's right. I, I freaking love it. Someone asked me about it on Twitter,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.640]   social here recently. And the best analogy I could give is for me, it's, it's, it's a lot of work
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.840]   when you go there. It's a lot of walking. But I absolutely love that, that adrenaline I get
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.040]   from just trying to find the, find the good stuff to share with everybody, get that packaged up and
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.840]   ship that and then go and do it all over again the next morning. It's about like,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.360]   people that love to go to the gym, going to the gym and lifting weights and running. There's a
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   little bit of ache and pain that comes with that, but it hurts good. You know, and that's,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.280]   that's how I equate CES in my experience. You know, that's weird. That's just weird. Yes, I am.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.880]   No, I agree. You know, I liken it to go to New York City. Every time I go to New York,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.800]   the energy just, I get excited. And you're right. Same thing.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:30.400]   See, it's smelling that, that convention floor carpet you just smell urine. There's,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.920]   there's odors associated with both, but, you know, there's an excitement. There's an energy
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   there, isn't there? Yeah. And then in the evening, I, once I'm done with everything being created
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.200]   and published or whatnot, I go grab my camera and I just go walk some more for the rest of the night.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   And there's always some beautiful photo opportunities that there are interesting photo opportunities
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.880]   out there. It's, it is the busiest, you know, three, four days for me. And I probably average about
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.640]   three hours of sleep, if that, and I feel great. I'm trying to make you feel very guilty for not
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.440]   setting them. And I, well, we got to last you the last time we went was 2020 right before the
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.760]   pandemic. Right. Right. Before the pandemic. And we had a great time and Ant wore the hell out of me.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.120]   And then, and then we have dinner and he disappeared and I said, "Ant, you're going down
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.640]   and playing poker, aren't you?" And he said, "No, I'm taking pictures." I was impressed. I was very
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.480]   impressed. It's funny to go to Las Vegas. When I was, that's the only time I've ever been there.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.280]   And I was like, I looked around and besides CS, I was like, I don't smoke. I don't gamble. I mean,
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.040]   no, nothing moral. I just don't really do it. Doesn't have the don't have the knack or vibe.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.960]   And I don't do that other thing you can do in Las Vegas. And I was like, there's not so much here
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:45.360]   for, you know, there's the show. Do you drink? I don't really drink. You are a loser. Geez, Louise.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   I don't really drink. I don't drink. I don't drink. I don't drink. I don't drink. I don't drink.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.920]   Yes, with Glenn's wife. No sizz. I'll have a half a club soda if you insist.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.920]   Half a club soda. My wife and I realized we're from, we're from like two generations of T-totlers.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:05.120]   Oh, I'm sure. I have mixed fee. As most people will go to CES and have been, I've been for many
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.720]   years and then, in the comics for many years before the, I have mixed feelings about it, you know,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.640]   and it's almost always a relief not to go. Because, hey, you know, you're going to get sick. You
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.680]   didn't get sick, and I was impressed. But you know, you're going to get sick. I did not, but I have
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.960]   gotten sick and years passed. But when I used to hear folks like you say this about CES, I'm like,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.600]   what are they talking about? There's no way. But after doing it for a handful of years, I get
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.240]   where you come from. It is a grind. And one of the things you learn is that most of the stuff you're
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   going to see is never going to emerge. Right. And that, like what a concept car. Yeah. Well,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   the original idea, I think of CES, was companies go and show vendors, dealers, people are going to
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.840]   sell it. Yeah. Their ideas. And then, and if everybody says, oh, that's good. We'll buy a thousand of
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.880]   them, then they make it. They don't make it until they sell it. And so I think that that's
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:01.600]   one reason a lot of stuff is shown that never comes out. Although with TVs, for instance, and
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.600]   that's one of the big draws of CES with TVs. Those are the big companies, Panasonic, Sharp,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:15.760]   Sony, LG, CCL, high sense, they emerged at CES, took over the Microsoft booth,
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.800]   high sense. That's something I miss by not going for sure is that, is that you kind of, it's like
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.960]   was a Akihabara, the street in Japan. I don't know if you still go where it's like, you're like,
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.160]   what's coming next? And Wired had it was a Japanese school girl technology watch for a while,
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.520]   which is like, you're trying to figure out that here is you go girls carrying.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.360]   Yeah. And so I think CES is like a much bigger version of that. But it's like,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.960]   what are people working on? Like, what are they actually all around the world? What
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.560]   have they actually put into a product they can show you in a setting? And even if 80% of it
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.400]   doesn't ship, you're like, oh, this is the state of the art. This is all the, you know,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.280]   all the stuff people are working on, which is, I don't know, I think that's thrilling.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.400]   It is also in past years been a showcase for self-driving vehicles, electric vehicles,
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.840]   new to auto technology. Weirdly, Microsoft is there. They've gone back to CES, but as a,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.680]   but not as the Windows company or even the Azure company, but as the mobility company,
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:16.480]   and they're showing car solutions, which is interesting. Sony is not at CES this year. Usually,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.800]   they view their new TVs. They decided not to. They're going to set focus on PS2.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:31.680]   And it says, yeah, with a five, what did I say? PS2. PSVR2, which is for the PS5. There we go.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.360]   Okay. And according to the Virgin Electronic Electric Vehicle that Sony is going to be doing,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.520]   so cars are very big. So here's what's going to happen. Just so you know,
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.720]   Father Robert Balisser is there. Stacey Higginbotham is there.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Scott Wilkinson's not, but his friend Mike Heis is, we're going to get reports from Scott Stacey
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.160]   and Father Robert on Sunday on Ask the Tech guys or brand new show. And then Sunday,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.760]   after that Sunday evening on Twitch, Stacey will be our guest. So we will have our CES coverage.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:09.680]   We'll be on the last day of CES. Weirdly moved this year to starts tomorrow through Sunday.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.440]   Oh, yeah. Normally it's a week in midweek, but it's weekend holidays on Sunday.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.240]   Is that why it was the holiday? They had to push it back. That makes sense.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.400]   Had to move it around. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I always have a little fo-mo.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.840]   I'm sure you do too, Ant. We're not there. What's happening?
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.960]   I wrote the days of the video parts of it, including porn and all that.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:38.640]   Oh, yeah. They separated that out. So it's used to be because it was just VCR, VHS tapes
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:44.000]   in the corner of the adult corner of CES. There was just a bunch of VHS tapes.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.280]   And then they separated it to a different venue. In fact, one year I was there with Tech TV,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.040]   and we had cameras and we said, let's go over to the, I think it was the adult entertainment
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.760]   expo they called it. And we went over there with cameras. It was quite embarrassing because I go
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.160]   in the door. Remember, I'm on tech TV at the time. And one of the cam girls goes, "Lleo!"
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.080]   And comes running over.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:17.360]   I said, "Stop shooting. Stop shooting. Stop it. Turn up the cameras."
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.840]   We actually, I ended up making friends with her. I don't know if I should admit this. Not that kind
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.360]   of friend. But we got, I got to know her. She was a fan of tech TV. And a year later, we were
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:36.880]   looking to do, we did stunts on tech TV because it was TV, cable TV. And we were going to do a
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.640]   win-a-date stunt. And we decided, let's use the cam girl. And so it was going to be win-a-date with
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.280]   what I came remember what her name was. Win-a-date with her. But it was troubling because we had
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.920]   the people on. We had her on a camera. And she kept taking off, trying to take over clothes.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.520]   You can't do that. You can't. Stop it.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.440]   It's important to point out that a lot of innovation technology started with pornography.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:09.920]   That's why it's that. So it's always, yeah, if you're too prudish as a technology-related person
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:15.040]   about it, then you wind up missing out on things. And I remember meeting the Netscape webmaster many
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.400]   years ago. And he told me about being on a panel with somebody from Hustler or some of those
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:28.320]   magazines. And it was talking about, well, we can't get a 320x240 pixel screen doing more than 10
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.480]   frames per second. She's like, we can sell that. And he's like, oh, that's the future. People
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.240]   pay for stuff. But they did also develop the technologies that got a higher resolution faster.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.000]   I mean, they absolutely drove that whole streaming video market because there was big money in it.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   You got to watch certain market segments, even if you're not interested in the products or services
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:56.240]   offered. Well, the other thing is at NAB, the church piece, the religious broadcasters.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.160]   Yeah. Huge amounts of smaller technology to try to get them going.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.280]   Well, you know, we use Tri-Caster and one of their big markets is Mega-Churches.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.560]   Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's also the remote wireless mics. I think churches were big
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   pushers in terms of trying to get the FCC to license that really weird. Is that a very complicated
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:22.960]   thing about a carve out with wireless access to prevent interference from like unlicensed purposes?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.880]   Anyway, because they use wireless mics like crazy throughout urban and suburban areas.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.360]   Yeah. Right. So it was Broadway. It's like the scene from Spinal Tap where he's got a wireless
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:38.000]   guitar pickup and they're at an Air Force base and they keep getting the air traffic controllers on the
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:46.880]   TV. Right. Right. Right. Right. There's four. We've come a long way from Cam Girls to this Twitch
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:57.040]   streamer controlled entirely by AI, neuro-sama every day between 6 and 11 p.m. Greenwich Mean
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.160]   Time. I got to explain to Vice. We don't call it that anymore. It's UTC. But anyway, neuro-sama
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:10.000]   streams herself playing Minecraft and Osu, which is a musical rhythm game. She looks like a Japanese
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.720]   anime style character. 50,000 followers talks with them in chat, but she's not a human. She's an AI.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.040]   Wild. Wild. This is, of course, this is where that all happens. Just is Japanese
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.320]   youth culture. Right. I mean, I saw a story I didn't put in the rundown about a huge market in
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   China for making up fake people. I don't mean to be a spokesperson, a spokesperson.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:42.080]   Do you want to see Kazuna? Here she is on her YouTube channel, the AI channel.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:50.640]   This is disaster for, this is a takedown right now. I don't know if I should play this. Maybe
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.240]   just leave this for you. Playing a game using only your voice, but you could see there's a certain...
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:06.160]   [speaking Japanese]
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.360]   So that's an AI voice even. It's not a human. At least according to the story,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.320]   you never know. Right? It could be some person, some 38 year old guy,
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.160]   and a wife, doing the background. I don't know. My vocoder.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.880]   In the latest livestream on Monday, according to Vice, when a user asked Neurosama if she's
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.000]   more of a chip or a dale type of chipmunk, she said, "I think I'm more of a dale."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.440]   She frequently back and forths with the chat saying things, "Are you seriously trying to troll me?"
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:45.200]   That was an awful chat after numerous users put F in the chat and said of questions for her.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:52.880]   Wow. Interesting. So I guess this is the next generation of cam performers.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.120]   Why use a human when you can do AI?
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   And I wanted to ask you if you were watching Monday Night Football on Monday and what you thought.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:12.880]   I watched it briefly because I was busy doing something else and then I saw the incident with
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:22.720]   Damar Hammer Hammer. Yeah. 24 year old safety, a very routine tackle catching. He tackled the guy
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.240]   and got up. Former Clemson Tiger, T Higgins, was told that he was tackling.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:34.640]   Okay. Got up, then staggered and fell and they actually had to call off the game. They performed
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.920]   CPR on him for something like nine minutes. Nine minutes. Brought an ambulance out on the field
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.760]   and took him to the hospital where he's still in critical condition. And we don't know much.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:50.080]   They haven't said, "It is as far forward as he is improving, but he's still in critical care."
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   So according to the bills, he suffered cardiac arrest during the play. His heartbeat was restored
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.560]   on the field. They had a small defibrillator in the ambulance, which I didn't see. I thought
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   it was manual CPR, but no, in fact, they had defibrillator and he is in the hospital sedated.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.520]   I think they had, I was told they had to intubate him. So right. Yes, they did.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.400]   Right. Since he's on a ventilator, you don't want to be conscious during that.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.520]   His heartbeat was according to the bills was restored on the field, transferred to the
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.640]   University of Cincinnati Medical Center for further testing and treatment.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.480]   And they had to do it again in the hospital.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.960]   Did they? Oh, yeah. That's worrisome.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:32.480]   I did not see it. We were on the airplane coming home, but when we turned on the news on the way home,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:39.040]   it was of course all over the news. I saw a reference on Twitter and went to dial immediately
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.320]   and was shocked what was going on. And it was also just amazing. And I was curious,
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.280]   what do the commentators say? They just didn't know what to say.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.720]   And the commentators were, they wanted to be sensitive to the situation.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.680]   ESPN was the broadcaster. Right. They wanted to be sensitive to the situation,
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.200]   but at the same time, you could see that they were, their emotions were all over the place.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   And I felt for those, those folks trying to do that job because they wanted to present the
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.080]   information to the viewers, but it was very difficult for them because they could see someone's
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.800]   life was in the balance right in front of their eyes. And that was to me, the most remarkable
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:24.080]   thing after the fact I saw a video, I didn't see the, the tackle or his fall, but of all the
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.280]   players crying and you see these big, brook, brook, brook, guys in tears.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.840]   And that was the grace of God go. They. Yeah. Well, that's right. That was so close.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.680]   The other thing that struck me Leo is the damage that the professional football does
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   to young men's bodies. We don't see until a few decades later. And this is a case where we saw it
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.240]   right there. You know, and it's even with that incident there, and I don't want to diminish this.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.600]   Yeah, he took a hit in the chest and that triggered it. It was kind of a freak as far as we know.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:04.160]   It is a freak accident because that typically you see stuff like that would happen in an auto
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.360]   racing event because of the impact hitting them all in that jarring motion, but it's still a
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:17.520]   freak accident. I hate what I saw online was the people were. Number one, blaming it on football.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.640]   It's not necessarily football's fault. Blaming it on T Higgins, the receiver himself, certainly
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.240]   not his fault, not his fault. And next, blaming on some other political bull crap that I'm not
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.800]   even going to say what it is. Some other political stuff. This is just a freak accident.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.440]   It's amazing. How people get politics into everything is just mind politics.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.320]   It's not just politics. It's lies. Yeah. But, but, but, but, but, because I'm not a sports guy,
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.680]   your kids played football and you, I think you played football, right? And he's certainly a huge
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.240]   football fan. Yes, sir. Um, play. Does, does it damage the sport?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:31:00.080]   No, in my opinion, no, it does not. Um, and, and I'm very, very different when it comes to this
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.960]   because I know about all of the CTE and the concussions that people did with my son got a concussion,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:14.640]   the college boy, he got a concussion back four years ago. And it pretty much ruined Queen Pruitt.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.840]   She wouldn't go to another game because she, she didn't like what she saw. She supports them,
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:26.640]   but she couldn't go back to a ball game. And when this incident happened Monday night, it
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.160]   brought me to tears because it's just, it's beyond my control, but at the same time,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.840]   um, those kids are out there doing what they freaking love to do.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.960]   And, and that sometimes that sad stuff happens and I could think about
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   hard head right now and that's in high school and the stuff that he's gone through and, and his
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.520]   teammate, the quarterback took a blow to the head at the end of a game.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:01.280]   And that really wrecked us. You know, that was a, that was a hard night in, in trying to
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:08.960]   get so my son and push him through that and, whoo, you know, but at the same time, he wanted to be
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.360]   out there for his team and he wanted to be out there for the love of the game, but yet he knows
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:20.800]   this is a very, very risky sport at times. And can I ask you the, the, uh, reparative, uh,
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.840]   surgery you had? Was that, was that football injuries? Believe it or not, uh, track and field
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:33.200]   brought that on. Really? Track and field brought that on. I, I ran the high hurdles and I had a,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:40.080]   a, a cartilage tear in my hip and it was on my trail leg. So doing that repetitive motion,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.600]   right, whipping my trail leg across that hurdle just kept making it worse. I didn't know it at the
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:54.560]   time. We wish the best certainly for tomorrow. But, uh, I think part of what makes football fun
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:02.240]   is the risk young, young men especially need to take risks. Right. Uh, it's, it's part of our,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.480]   or, or they're being exploited for that. Well, that's the other question. I wonder that when I see
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.680]   boxing, I often feel like, Oh, yeah, this is an exploitive sport. You know, these are, these are
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.480]   usually a poor black men who, uh, had no other way of making a living. So we put them in the ring
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.360]   and made them punch each other. Right. Yeah. My, my dad loved boxing, watched boxing for many
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.760]   decades and you ask him any statistic before a certain year and he can tell you everything about
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.000]   everything. And then at some point he just hit the limit and went, Oh, I can't, you know, I can't
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.520]   watch and support this anymore. Um, and I don't think that was blindness on his part. He's a very
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.000]   good guy. Uh, or anybody's part is still likes boxing. It's like we all have our different limits
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.600]   and how we perceive it. It's not like blood sport or something. It's not like watching it. But it kind
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.560]   of is a blood. And this, I have the same qualm because I love football. I love gridiron.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:55.600]   I love watching the NFL. Uh, Lisa and I both do. We know about CTE. We know about the long-term
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.760]   damage. Many of these athletes suffer. We now it's been brought right up to us the day to day
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:07.920]   risks as well. My kid played the pop Warner in fifth grade and he loved it. And they, you know,
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.200]   it's fifth grade, but they were yeah, it's helmets. They take hits too. They take hits and in a
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.720]   practice game, uh, one of the players got a Tib fib break, a serious break. He's in a hip cast
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.640]   for the rest of the season. And I'm thinking, do I want my son out there doing this? But he loved it.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:33.200]   And so it's hard. That's where I am. I see all of those, those potentially horrible aspects of it.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:40.880]   Yet at the same time, I tell my family this all the time football changed my life. I mean,
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:47.120]   I can go all the way back to being seven years old in the exact moment where my life changed socially
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   as a young black man and and being different from the other kids in the neighborhood, not having
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.320]   friends, but something about football and that it flipped a switch and my life change going
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:05.680]   forward and then being able to get relationships with with coaches. Now, granted, I did see my father
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.120]   regularly, you know, but when I was six years old, he and my mother divorced. So he wasn't in the house,
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:19.600]   but having those father figures as coaches was tremendous for me. And it all turns back to football.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:25.920]   So it's really hard for me to poo poo the game of football when I look at what it's done for me in
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.680]   my life and help me in my day to day. Can I ask you a question, Nick? Sure.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.720]   Because I'm not, as you know, a sports guy at all, right? I'm like, I'm like a Christmas and
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:43.520]   Easter Christian. I'm a Super Bowl and World Cup sports fan, right? Nice. And so watching the World
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.640]   Cup, which this year was just, even I knew was amazing. Yeah. What always strikes me and I watch,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:56.320]   what we call soccer is that, you know, when you get kicked in the shins, you roll around in the
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.000]   ground and agony to try to get the penalty, right? And so it's this, it's this performative agony
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.240]   versus American football is, I can take anything. And I'm not hurt. No, don't, I do it through the
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.880]   pain. I do it with the pain. There just seems to be a, a huge cultural difference there.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.240]   I'm going to come up and kick you hard in the shins. And then you tell me how you feel.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.480]   But the football, they don't, American football, they don't do it. You kick my heart of the shins
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.960]   football. I drop baseball is the same way. They rub it off. Whatever you do, don't you?
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.200]   Exactly. I think it's a, so wait, the question is, is that American? Is part of the problem with
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:38.480]   American football is the sport and, and race and television and money, but is it also our culture?
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.320]   I would think is American culture myself. I heard all of that in football, basketball, baseball,
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.840]   all of those. You get hurt, be quiet, rub a little dirt on it. You'd be okay, you know,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.360]   a little stuff like that. Yeah. And that is very American.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.920]   Don't cry. We joy that. You tell boys not to cry, don't we? Yeah. And, and there's
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.360]   problems with that. You shouldn't tell them not to cry. But the biggest thing that I got out of it was
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.280]   things are going to hurt sometimes, but it's not it shouldn't stop you. You know, and you can take
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   that metaphorically in life. You know, you're going to have some challenges in just societal norms,
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.480]   but you can't let it hold you back either. You know, it's such an interesting question because
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.240]   the players want to do it, right? They love it. You just told an amazing story
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   about it changing your life at the age of seven.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:40.320]   Yeah. I remember the exact moment I was playing cornerback of all positions, had no idea what
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.480]   I was doing at cornerback and this kid, you were seven. Right. And you're seven. It's okay. You didn't
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.080]   need to do that. And by the way, a quarterback, that's another thing. That's a big difference.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.960]   That's another thing that's a big difference. Football for some reason, seven, you know,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.200]   you watch a seven year old group of seven year olds play soccer. It's like you're watching a
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:06.720]   school of fish swimming. They're all in case. They got not one kid's face. But it's very
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:13.200]   football in America, even for little kids is extremely serious. You don't screw around in football.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.320]   By the way, you were telling your story. No, it's I remember I was playing cornerback and
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:25.440]   we were playing against Iva in South Carolina. And the kid got the ball to run around the
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:32.640]   corner towards me. And there was this moment of oh crap. This here he comes versus this other kid.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   What am I supposed to do? And something just said, go hit him, go make the tackle. And when I went
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:44.160]   to hit him and make that tackle, I remember the sound. I remember what it feels like. I remember
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.400]   the sideline because it was on my sideline. I remember my coaches yelling. I remember my
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.080]   teammates yelling and something just changed right there. And I was hooked ever since.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.320]   And it totally changed my life. That kid, however, decided to become an artist.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:07.680]   No, now I feel jealous. I feel I have always felt envious of people who played team sports
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.000]   through college or even later. There's something you get out of being on a team
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.520]   together that is a super valuable lesson. Yeah. You know, and my mother did she didn't want me to
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:26.560]   play that. That was a big battle in the family. But her her friend at the time
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.080]   taught their into it because he was a coach. And I'm forever grateful for him.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.520]   Good for him. Yeah. Yeah. And it did. It literally changed my life. And the whole team aspect that
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.440]   you mentioned, I stand by that, sir. I said that. I mean, this issue with the
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.640]   issue of football is a lot of change, though, right? Is that it's not the same game you played
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.480]   when you were a kid. I mean, at the professional level, but even at the college level, it's like,
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.560]   in a bigger, harder, faster, kind of like every sport, it's got optimized towards something that
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.120]   is more dangerous. And I don't think the sports safety, I mean, we're starting to finally see it,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.680]   it hasn't caught up with that increased level of danger. And if that keeps that, I mean, that's
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.080]   the thing is, you know, you wouldn't be playing in high school if your school can get insurance,
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.320]   and we're starting to see reports of that. So it's going to have to change at a high school and
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.760]   below level. So the schools can keep it insured. Otherwise, there won't be any pipeline to players.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.640]   There is definitely a trickle down with the research on helmets starting to happen
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.880]   towards the high school side. I can't say towards the popcorner side yet,
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.520]   because that's a whole different ball. Otherwise, it's usually private. But it is trickling down
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   into the high school level, far as to protection that they're getting in the helmets and in the
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.200]   shoulder pads and things like that. And they're changing the rules dramatically every season.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.040]   The rules change dramatically on, you know, whether you can hit a quarterback,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.760]   you know, how you hit somebody, how you hit a helmet to helmet, you know, pet tip. We used to
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:56.400]   call it clipping, which tackling some of the below the knees from behind. And that is, I mean,
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.360]   there are so many more things you can do that are wrong. And that's good. That's in response to
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.680]   that. But you make a good point, Glenn, because our training methods have gotten so good in our
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:13.040]   diet and so forth, we can make people are huge, hugely strong. When you get hit by a 300 pound guy,
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.600]   I don't care if he's tackling you perfectly. It's it's got to.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.160]   Where does mean Joe Green? If you look at mean Joe Green compare with these players,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:28.880]   or Joe refrigerator, Perry, you're like, I don't know. He's kind of like a college fridge.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.600]   I mean, that's amazing, isn't it?
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.840]   Storm fridge. Yeah. Not to make fun. Those are great players in their day. It's funny. It's like
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.200]   we start talking about I'm like, Oh, yeah, I used to watch football. I kind of forgot. But I say
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.560]   those were great players in their days. It's a wonderful sport to watch. It's so it's so I imagine
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.920]   and I think you've proven it, and a wonderful sport to play. And it's dangerous. But I think
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.720]   danger is maybe part of the excitement of playing it. If we're perfectly safe, would it be as fun?
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:07.840]   I'm not sure. But I will say that I've taken a beaten more so on the basketball court.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.960]   Did I? Oh God, the throw and elbows. Yeah. And there's no protection. There's no
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.280]   passes. More instruments in the basketball. Yeah. Then football. Yeah. Hands down.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.000]   Well, you're not protected. Yeah. Nope. The technology angle to this story, Leo,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.480]   was interesting because I watched for a long time and TV didn't know what to do. So they threw
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.800]   it every commercial they had in the box. It kept going to come back. They didn't know if the game
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.760]   was going to come back for a little. No, right? But the thing is the crowd of the stadium
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.200]   stayed there. There was nothing being told of them. Nothing wrong. But they all had phones.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.160]   They all knew what's going on. They cared. You know, this is Cincinnati. It was a serious game.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.800]   They really cared. And one of the things you see in football that you don't see in any other sport
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.680]   is the brotherhood between teams. It always amazes me at the end of the game when team
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:03.040]   players who've been fighting each other like animals for a whole game come over and hug each
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.320]   other and shake hands. Say, how you doing? How the kids sure do? There is a fraternity of football
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.200]   players. I never see that in basketball. I don't think they do it in baseball. Not only they not
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:18.160]   do it. They shake. They each other. They shake the. Yeah. The other. The losing team slinks off.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:24.640]   And the yeah, football players love each other. And I think part of that is because they know
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.560]   they're gladiators in the arena. And but also because they all played with each other. They
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:37.280]   all know each other pretty well. I think it's a beautiful sport. I'm a huge fan. And as a fan,
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.440]   and I'm glad we have you here because as a fan, I always worry that we're supporting
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:48.960]   something that is not good that is exploitative of the players or not good for the players now.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.480]   And the whole exploitation thing has been thrown out for the last handful of years.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.360]   And I get where people are coming from. But at the end of the day, these players that sign those
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:07.680]   contracts, they choose to sign the contracts. They don't have to play an NFL. They can go and
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:13.760]   get a job over here in and out. But they're given a tremendous opportunity to change their
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:21.280]   life financially. And they choose to sign that contract. That's just how you can say about it.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.000]   The other thing I would say is that in generations and centuries past, we've gone to war instead.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.240]   So maybe it's nice to have an alternative for you to express those feelings and get that
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.840]   testosterone out without killing without literally killing each other.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.680]   This all actually is a Google story. Surprise. Look at you.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.880]   Look at me. You got skills. Google won the contract for Sunday ticket.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:57.040]   It's going to be on YouTube TV. This was talking about a battle. Apple was the front runner for a
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.320]   long time. The NFL gets a billion and a half dollars a year from direct TV.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.280]   Direct TV has been losing their shirt on it. They did it because they figured this is going to sell
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.440]   a lot of satellite dishes and a lot of subscriptions, not just to homeowners, but to bars.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.600]   But ultimately, they couldn't justify the billion and a half dollars a year.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:23.600]   And the networks went to. Yeah. And so who came in to Amazon, Google, and Apple, the tech companies
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:32.480]   who have the money to spend and who have an interest beyond gaining subscribers. Apple eventually
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.760]   dropped out, I think, because they couldn't come to an agreement with the NFL about how Apple could
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.800]   run it. For instance, I've heard Apple wanted to give it away free.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.320]   That there was part of Apple clusters. Yeah. And there were some issues over international
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:52.800]   rights, but Google jumped in as soon as Apple withdrew and took it. We don't know how much they
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   paid, but speculation is at least two billion a year. Google kind of. Because I was on vacation
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.000]   last week, I didn't read into this a whole lot. I just saw it headline and said, "No, I'm not working."
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.400]   But I was curious, was there anything about the potential price into the consumer? Because
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.160]   that was the problem with the Red TV in its package deal, was it was ridiculously
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.320]   expensive for those handful of games to happen for roughly six months. It just never really
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.360]   equated to being a good dollar value. I'm looking at the Google blog post and I don't see anywhere
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.960]   where they've said how much, but I have read in commentary that it's expected. They will upsell
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.640]   it, that it won't be part of, you'll have to be a YouTube TV subscriber, and then you'll have to
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:48.480]   pay an additional monthly fee. I wouldn't be surprised. Google could subsidize it, but I think the NFL
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:54.640]   probably wants a percentage. Google also has the beats to sell the advertising that Apple doesn't
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:02.480]   have. Well, that's exactly right. It's all out of market Sunday regular season NFL games based on
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.040]   the viewers location. This is the biggest problem with the NFL, by the way. Good luck trying to watch
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.560]   a game out of market. Broadcast on Fox CBS NFL Sunday ticket allows fans in the US
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.920]   the ability to follow all their favorite teams and players no matter where they live. That's the
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.480]   real value of it. Our Sunday Green Bay Packers fan, they're never going to have a local broadcast
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   of the Packers unless they're playing the Niners. So now we can watch the Packers games.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.600]   Updated Sunday ticket product features and functionality will be announced ahead of the
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:37.360]   2020 3 NFL season. That means later this summer. I'm going to guess it's going to cost a not
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:42.480]   insignificant amount of money every month, but I don't know. I don't know. I think to remember,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.160]   like, if you wanted to order it, it was damn near $400 back. I think that's what it will be.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   That's been my guess. That's for a six month season, right? For a second. August through February.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:04.240]   With I love the idea of having the ability to see out of market, uh, uh, teams. Is that me? Oh,
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:10.400]   am I beeping? Is that not me? I guess you. Oh, no, it was John. It was John. Mr.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:17.840]   Jammer. 14 minutes came. That was 14 minutes. Timer. Well, there you go. Timer. That's what it was.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:24.480]   There you go. That one happens. But with, oh, okay. That's the, okay. So I should explain
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.840]   what that timer is and what the alarm is. We have a new studio sponsor. Thank you. ACI learning.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:35.760]   They're part of the IT pro family. They also have auto pro practice labs hubs.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:44.480]   We have been partners with IT pro TV forever. Now it's ACI learning from IT pro and they
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:50.560]   sponsor the studio. So every 14 minutes, I guess we have to put this. We're going to eventually
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.960]   have signage in here. That's as we did. Oh, I'm years ago, but that's in lieu of that.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.360]   And I just want to welcome them and thank them very much because that's a, that's going to be a,
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:06.080]   a big help to keeping the lights on around here. I hope you just do a green screen across your desk
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.520]   and it'll just like flow. I'd be like a football studio. We can actually do that. I don't know why
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.280]   we don't do that. We do that. The ticker on the bottom of the, yeah, we can have it.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:21.920]   The ticker. The electronic. Yeah. Well, I don't know. But when I was getting at about the whole
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:28.080]   package, it's good that you can get these out of my out of market games. But my problem is YouTube
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:36.720]   TV service, not necessarily working for families. My college boy, even though he is on my quote,
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:44.080]   family plan as an authorized user, so on and so forth, he cannot watch YouTube TV being off in
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:50.880]   college in a whole different zip code. That makes no dad gum sense to me. If he were trying to use
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:58.160]   my username and password up there, I get that. But he's, he's in my, my plan. He's, he's, I've
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:03.280]   authorized him and everybody else under the plan to be able to access the service. I don't understand
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.480]   why Google can't, you know, flip a switch and say, Oh yeah, he's legit. You know, he should be able
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.120]   to do this. Oh, it drove me crazy when we were in Mexico, we wanted to watch the 49ers game and
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:21.360]   I tried every, every method. I did express VPN and that worked with Amazon Prime, but Google was
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:28.320]   way too smart. They said, you're not in the country. I tried every possible method I subscribed to NFL
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:33.680]   plus. And they said, but you're not in the country. And this is the problem. There's so much money
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:39.920]   in this. These rights deals are extremely complicated. The Mexican broadcasters obviously have their
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:45.600]   own separate bill and I'm with that deal. They, the NFL guarantees, no one, no, they can't watch
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.080]   it any other way. And so it's a VPN would get you in. No, I don't know how they're getting around it.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:59.360]   But at the same time, why, why do I have to figure out a VPN option on a television set? Well,
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.920]   and why doesn't the NFL have a deal? I mean, I'm willing to give money.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:12.400]   Just give me a way to do it. They're literally for money or blood or money. There was no way to get it.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:18.080]   The only way I could get it was you watch Red Zone, which is the most ADD thing ever.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:24.640]   It is, it's it's nightmare. I should say that they go to game, ding, ding, ding, ding,
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:30.080]   but anyway, we were able to see some of the place. So that was good. YouTube actually, CNBC says it'll
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:35.680]   be roughly two billion a year. So that's the it's there will be at the start of this new season
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.200]   next year available as an add on package. If you're already a YouTube TV subscriber,
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:47.680]   but this is the good news, and as a standalone, a la carte option on YouTube's prime time channels.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:53.440]   So it'll be part of YouTube TV, but also part of YouTube. So there may be a solution there for you.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:02.160]   So, you know, and I'm sure Google will monetize it, but but maybe they will subsidize it as well.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:13.200]   We'll see. It was a Sunday ticket on direct TV was $80 a month for the base option and extra
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:21.600]   features for $149 a month. So $80 $80 times six months. Yeah. But that was the basic. Yeah,
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.320]   that was a basic almost 500 bucks.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:31.600]   It'll be interesting to see Google go up against Murdoch whenever sports things come up for
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.560]   expiration. Because that's Murdoch's whole strategy is to get as much sports audiences he can.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   I think this is the problem knows these tech companies have such deep pockets that even Rupert
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.680]   Murdoch can't compete. And he already hates Google anyway, because they're competitors.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.520]   And now they're really going to hate each other. So what is he going to do? He's going to do what
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.640]   everybody else does. He's going to go to government, whether it's the US government or the EU and say,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:03.520]   or Australia, which he practically owns and say, Hey, these guys are doing me dirt,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.880]   which brings us to probably the most important story of the week.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   The Irish regulators have ruled that meta. They're finding meta $400 million. But more importantly,
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:31.680]   they're saying you cannot use what you know about your users to spend to sell ads.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.960]   They're a very sad trombone sound right here.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.880]   A top European Union privacy regulator ruled this is from the Wall Street Journal. Metaplyforms
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.960]   cannot use its contracts with Facebook's and Instagram users. They can't say, Hey, they said it was
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:52.080]   okay. Look, they signed this special contract, which nobody reads to justify sending them ads
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:59.200]   based on their online activity. Now, this all runs through his media too. It screws everybody at
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:07.360]   Google probably more than anybody else. Now a $400 million fine is to Facebook is not the end of the
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:13.920]   world bigger. Well, these days I'd be well, they have well, it's part of it. This is the first
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.480]   isn't this one of the first resolutions the GDPR was passed a few years ago. And there were massive
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.680]   complaints that the process was, you know, anybody, any citizen of the EU or I think certain residents
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.880]   and other organizations could file complaints and companies be forced to turn over a significant
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:34.960]   percentage like single digit percentage of their annual revenue and global revenue, if I recall,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:43.120]   right? And this as I read this, these are 2018 complaints being resolved in late 2022 early
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:50.160]   2023 here, right? And the Irish regulators now issued a billion dollars in fines, but it took
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:55.120]   a while. So these companies were able to reap the rewards from it. And also with Apple's change,
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:01.360]   they're they're do not track me thing. They're oh, yeah, that policy which, which Facebook said was
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.360]   going to cost them billions. There's been some disputes about whether that are really incurred
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:11.760]   that kind of cost. But people do people when given the choice say, please do not track me across apps.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:16.240]   And that's kind of the fundamental privacy issue. And it's going to cost these companies money that
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:21.040]   built their operations around tracking them across apps. But in this case, this is even like within
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.800]   the app, right? This is where it gets to it is it's that it's within their systems. You agree.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.360]   There when you sign up for Instagram that we could track you, you allowed us to right? And you still
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:35.440]   can't. Now according to the world, but they're saying you have to expose it better. No, no,
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:41.920]   no, they're saying you may not, despite you cannot use its contracts with Facebook and Instagram
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.800]   users to justify sending them ads based online activity. Right? But you could, you could revise
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.480]   that and expose what they're saying is you could expose, as I understood it, you can expose
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:56.320]   an option for people, which is buried in the agreement now. But legitimately, you could expose
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.480]   an option and let people choose to be tracked. And that's kind of what Apple did. And most people
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.040]   opted out, but not everybody, but Apple provided a very binary option for users.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.920]   Apple doesn't really sell ads. Yeah. And so Meta, well, somewhat, but it's not the big business.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:15.040]   But Meta could provide incentives or presented in a different way that could wind up being
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.840]   compliant that would be explicit instead of buried in agreement and being compliant. So they have,
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.840]   they have options. They just don't like them as well as just hiding it from the user that
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:29.040]   they're doing this. This is what it's a demonizes this idea of targeting. As if it's, as if it's,
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.400]   it's the whole, you know, it drives me nuts. A lot of it is this horrible book I had to finish reading.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:41.280]   It's not surveillance. Surveillance is when governments come after you with police and watch
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:47.040]   you. This is ad tracking. It's, it's, it's a way that media and the internet is still seen as a
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.160]   medium and it gets born with mistakes here, including news, including a lot of entertainment,
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:59.440]   makes money so that you get what you get inexpensively. So what we're going to see out of this is
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:08.000]   yet tons of paywalls now and further redlining of quality news and entertainment for the privileged,
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   not for the society at whole. And it's going to be long term damaging, I argue.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.000]   So the, according to the Wall Street Journal, this issue is over first party data.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.720]   Right. Right. You can say, you know, as Apple does block third party trackers,
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:30.320]   but Apple, Facebook and Google all use first party data. And that's specifically what the
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:37.840]   Irish regulator is disallowing. Meta has long allows users to opt out of personalized ads based
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:43.920]   on data it leans from users activity on other websites and apps. But it doesn't give users that
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:48.080]   option for opting out of ads based on data about activity on its own platform, right,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:54.800]   right, or Facebook, such as what posts a user comments on, what videos and Instagram user watches.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.080]   The journal says that in house data is one of Meta's main tools for building customized
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:05.440]   audiences for the personal ads itself. This is, this is the first party loophole that Apple and
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.480]   others conveniently ignore. We've said this again and again. Yeah, all Apple's saying is you can't
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.200]   track, you know, somebody else's app, but Apple knows exactly what you do on the phone. Google
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.840]   knows exactly what you do every time you go on a search. Meta knows exactly what you're doing on
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:27.200]   every single meta property. Now the EU is saying you can't even use that data. I don't see anywhere
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:31.120]   where it says you could, you have to ask permission. Maybe maybe there is a loophole.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:41.360]   Meta says it disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal. And the journal says that could take
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:46.880]   years. But if the decisions are upheld, they could mean that Meta will have to allow users to
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:52.640]   opt out of ads that are based on how users interact with its own apps. So I guess that applies a switch.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.040]   Yeah. Yeah. But any question, I mean, right, in his first party data, if it's third party data,
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.840]   maybe it should be opt in or it should be informed in Apple's way. I mean, I guess, right, this gets
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   us to the heart of, you know, what we're paying for if we're the product, even if we're the product
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.400]   of a first party, a first party customization, there's some things I want delivered that way.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:15.600]   Remember when Gmail launched and people were freaked out, and in some ways, rightly so, the Gmail
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:20.080]   would handle or Google would analyze the contents of our email and serve personalized ads based
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:24.720]   against that, right? And now it's, I don't know what, how many years later are we 17 years or something?
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:29.520]   And it's still doing some variety of that. We don't have end to end encryption on email,
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   although Gmail recently announced they're going to enable an option for that, and they won't be
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.880]   able to sell ads against the contents of email. So, Google has long said we don't do that anyway.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.560]   Google, Google can easily. Well, they're doing something, right? They're doing something contextual.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.880]   They say they don't. Early, but there's not the contents. But they say they do not. But they don't,
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:52.480]   and that's only because they don't need to. Every time you do a search, you're announcing what
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:57.600]   your interests are. You, you give better than that information. So here's what I see is the
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:04.880]   critical thing. Application's AT, Apple's ATT switch, which by the way, a majority of users
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:10.560]   say, no, I don't want tracking. Never stopped first party data. It doesn't stop Apple.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:18.800]   Now the EU is saying Apple, Google, meta, you have to offer a switch that stops first party
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:26.320]   data. And, and I think every single user will turn that off. And I don't think that's a GDPR.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.760]   That's the other thing. I think it's a misreading as bad as GDPR is and as, and as confusing as it is,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.240]   I think it's a misreading of what's there. Because again, when the newspapers realize,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.160]   and news publishers realize what's going on here and entertainment companies realize what's
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.520]   going on here in this streaming world that is more and more supported by advertising,
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.880]   they're going to have fits here. Because, because I've been pushing every news organization out
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.120]   there to say, change your product strategy so you get first party data. That is your only defense.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.880]   Google went out there, right? And tried to kill cookies and the publishers weren't ready.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.480]   So they're the ones who said, no, no, no, no, hold on to cookies for now.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.720]   Because because they don't know what they're doing and they don't have their first party data
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.600]   strategies, they're going to be screwed all around. This is going to kill tons of media.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.640]   This is what the journal says. Ireland did not want to do this.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.880]   But they found that nothing in GDPR stopped meta from making behavioral ads a necessary part of
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:32.800]   its contract with users. But a number of other EU privacy regulators disagreed, arguing that
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.880]   behavioral ads are not necessary to provide a social network. They didn't need those ads.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.320]   And aboard of all EU privacy regulators, the European Data Protection Board last month,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.280]   overruled Ireland as part of a dispute resolution system built into GDPR.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.920]   So what happened is Ireland said, yeah, GDPR does not disallow this.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.320]   But the rest of Europe said, no, wait a minute, it does.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   Or a body representative.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:07.840]   Yeah, said, no, we believe that in fact, this is under the domain of GDPR and it isn't necessary
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.800]   for meta to create a business. So we're going to be a we believe that you should stop it.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.840]   I think this is a significant shot across the bow.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.160]   I think it should not be ignored. Now, it's going to take a while.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.360]   It'll be appealed. It'll be a lot of litigation.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.520]   But there's a risk to the US government do at the time when the US government is
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.280]   starting under both parties is going to the Pinser against Silicon Valley.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.520]   This is about protecting the American industry. You watch what's happening with
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.840]   Mastodon. It's fascinating that the EU government is investing in Mastodon.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.200]   So I think it's fine. I've said it for years. Stop worrying about Google,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.360]   invest in your own stuff because it's European and it's anti-silicon valley.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.440]   The government is taking a real role there in trying to fight Silicon Valley and the US government
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.280]   is going to have to say in trade agreements, wow, here. We'll see what they do.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.400]   Ah, yeah. I mean, I think users want that switch. Users want to be able to say,
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:15.440]   don't track me, bro. I think there's a fundamental issue not about
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.040]   whether personalized ads should be used at all and whether companies should have a right to use
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.800]   data they collect from you within their own systems in order to feed advertising. I think
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.240]   it's an ecosystem issue. It's a disclosure issue. And it's also what are we paying for issue, right?
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.480]   I preferentially pay for or use services that I know are not making money off me in
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.560]   the secondary way whenever it's possible. It's one reason why, again, like Mastodon,
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.120]   I'm not paying for Mastodon yet, but it is a superior product in some ways already for my
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.120]   particular set of interests because I'm not worried about Twitter's business model and
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.360]   anymore what they're doing with my data. Now, I should ultimately, I do want to pay somebody
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.720]   for Mastodon in some distributed way. Leo, thank you very much for underwriting the 100 million
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.040]   tweets or toots I've made on the social server. You're paying for me right now. Wonderful person.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:09.360]   I'm very glad to have you on the Mastodon. You're my volunteer payment coordinator here for this
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.720]   service. But so I don't blame Google or Apple any of the companies for wanting to do it. I feel like
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:22.320]   if you went too far, it's in creating a not providing enough guidance about what to do. And if the
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.560]   option were look, you got to have a really clear page where someone can go and say, "Don't do this,
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.080]   don't do this, don't do this." And the companies, I think by contrast, should say, if you slip the
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.720]   switch off, you're going to need to upgrade to a subscription where you pay X. I mean, that's the
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:41.360]   Twitter tradeoff, right? We're seeing in real time Elon Musk discover what advertising actually
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:46.800]   brings to Twitter and how his $8 a month service doesn't necessarily replace the value of the ads
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.000]   he wants to turn off. So is it a privacy thing when everything's first party and everything's kept
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.880]   within the system? Not as much as when we find out that companies have been leaking first party
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.400]   stuff into third parties, which comes up all the time. So there's trust issues. I don't know.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:07.520]   Just glad I think you're way right going back to the very beginnings to the first days of the
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:14.160]   first cookies. The cookies were necessary for the maintenance of web operations when they got used
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:20.240]   for advertising. We were not in the least transparent about it. It made it easy for the Wall Street
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.800]   Journal to come along and demonize them. What do they know about you? What they know? Right? It was a
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:31.280]   whole big series. And the industry, by that I mean both technology and media and advertising
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.880]   all hurt themselves by not having by not caring about the trust in the public. But let me ask you
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:44.160]   that got demonized overdone. Do you think it's a user's right to tell Facebook or Instagram or
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:50.080]   Apple or Google? No, I don't want you to track me. I think no, I actually don't think because I think
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:57.120]   it's what Glenn just said. A company can set the terms of their use. And they can say,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.800]   you want to use this thing? Fine. Here's the deal. Here's how we say the deal we make. Yeah.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.960]   Like Hulu. You pay a different rate of Hulu with ads and without ads. Right.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:14.640]   And it is the case that we're using these amazing free services from Google and Facebook. They're
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:21.200]   absolutely free. And they're paid for by advertising and that advertising, apparently advertisers
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.400]   believe, I know they tell us this, they need this tracking information. Yeah.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:31.040]   Advertisers have been spoiled by digital media. You know, when you buy a TV app, when you buy an
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.280]   ad on the Super Bowl, all you know is you're going to reach 80 million people. You don't know
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.240]   which people. Right. And that's why, you know, if you're Coca-Cola, you go, well, they all drink
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.360]   Coke or worse, they drink Pepsi and we want them to drink Coke. So that's a worthwhile buy.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:54.000]   But when people buy our podcasts, they want to know who am I talking to? And I understand why
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.280]   advertisers want that. And I understand it's a careful balance between us turning over information
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:06.880]   about our audience. The good news is with podcasting, we can't because it's RSS, all we know is your
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.840]   IP address. And even that we don't really care or know about Spotify comes on.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:19.680]   Well, but see, that's why it spotifies a threat and I heart and Amazon and audible because you,
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:25.600]   all of those shows you listen to only in their app and their app knows everything knows everything.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.240]   Charge card, your name, address phone number. It knows how much of the show you listen to,
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.920]   when you listen to it. Did you hear the ad? Did you not hear the ad? And advertisers, if given the
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.640]   choice between knowing absolutely nothing and absolutely everything, always are going to choose
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.280]   everything, whether it helps them or not, I don't know. But the other book that I had to read that
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:51.520]   drove me completely nuts is Jerry Loney, 10 arguments from reading your social media accounts.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.200]   So this is a companion piece to the much longer Shoshana Zubloff, right? The view of the moral
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.160]   entrepreneurs here is that advertising is the root of all ills at all. And so we should,
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   it should become a paid internet, which is a position of extreme privilege that you can afford to pay
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:16.560]   for all these services. But many can't, number one, or there's going to be crappy competition and
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:23.920]   disinformation that's always free. And I think that they're not looking at the larger picture of the
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.120]   ecosystem in which we live. I'm just surprised that Jerry Lenaire wrote a book because I remember
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.760]   his name is quote, when he missed the seventh deadline of not delivering an earlier book,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.400]   he called his publisher and said every cell in my body has been replaced since I agreed to meet
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:47.280]   the devil. Oh my God, 15, 15 years ago. Oh my God. He, but his hair was all was the same hair.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:57.520]   Jaren, who was an early proponent of VR, he was the VR King's has written books called You Are Not
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:07.360]   a Gadget, truth technology, and the visual virtual world, the dawn of the new everything, he's kind
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:16.080]   of become a lunite. Oh yeah, well, these technologists, Tristan Harris, Roger McNamee,
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:22.720]   Jaren Lenier, they made their money. They made their money, they cashlet check, and they see the
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.040]   brain bush and find virtue. Cliff Stoll, who got out of the business, who wrote a bunch of books
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.200]   that were like that, and they got out of the business and now makes Klein bottles. We have an
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.720]   interview in the right direction. I did a triangulation with Cliff. Oh yeah. Cliff used to be a regular
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:43.520]   on tech TV. He used to come on and do anti technology screens. We kind of love the guy. We loved it.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.160]   It was fun because here we are a technology channel, and some guys going he's saying exactly what
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:54.640]   Jaren just said, "Delete your social media." But we did an interview with him on his Klein bottles,
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.120]   and he went into his attic and he has a little robot that goes into his attic and fetches the
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:07.360]   Klein bottle and brings it out. It was on triangulation, well worth watching. Cliff wrote,
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.280]   he was the Kook who's a nest, which is a very famous book about tracking hackers.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:17.440]   I like Cliff a lot. He's a stranger. He's a weirdo. It's a long history of people. I mean,
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:22.400]   writing negative things about technology. It made John Cena's correct career.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.360]   It's also weirdly. At the same time, it's like if you're a school district or a state and you want
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:31.360]   to fund something, you say, "We're going to buy computers for every kid." If you want to sell a
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.040]   book, you say, "No kids should be using computers in schools." There's some fundamental conflict
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:43.360]   that I don't get. There was an exchange on Maskdown today, somebody who left Twitter wants to write a
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:49.280]   book about responsible AI. I'll find this in a second. Being driven nuts by agents and publishers
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   and front-right book, Mastic came in. Mastic, I have the same experience.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.680]   Mastic came in and said, "Yeah, I tried to sell a book that was positive about the internet."
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.880]   They all said, "Nobody wants that," which was, "My last book was, that's what happened. Nobody bought
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.040]   it. I'm going to try again soon." Two people still buy books, really?
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.880]   Yeah, it was a good year. The pandemic was a very good year.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.920]   Yeah, biggest highest dollar value. The ebook sales have tapered, leveled off.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.040]   Our cover sales remains strong. Trade sales are strong.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.320]   Kookoo's egg. Thank you very much, Doug, for correcting that. That was a close book of some years
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.120]   ago, probably 30 years ago. I met one of the guys in Kookoo's egg. I was reading it and I was like,
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.040]   "Oh, is that you?" Namered acted. And he said, "Oh my God, please don't bring that up." That ruined
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.720]   my childhood. He got caught hacking at a young age and redeemed himself. Was he German? I thought
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.440]   it was a German hacking group. I shouldn't reveal the details. I don't want to ruin his life 30 years
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.960]   later. His name was openly in the book and he hadn't changed his name. But he was hoping,
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.080]   "This is before the internet." Oh my God, I just realized. This was when I brought this up to him,
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.520]   wondering if it was the same person. This was before you could search on anything on the internet.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:01.680]   It was just the early days of Altavista. And so for him, he's like, "Oh, if you don't say anything
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.960]   to anybody, no one will ever hurt me." Yeah, you're not Yahoo. You're fine.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.640]   I know. And I'm like, "Oh, you type in... Oh, here's where he was in Cli...
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:14.160]   Poor guy. Who was that? By the way, how was your trip to Germany with your son? I saw all the
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:21.840]   pictures. I really enjoyed it. Oscar's like that. Each breakfast is the best breakfast you'd ever
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:29.520]   had to date. Oh my God, the food in Germany was so good. And it's just to eat. Chakia and
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:36.240]   Slovenia. And I met the last letterpress printer in Ljubdjana, Slovenia. It was a lovely guy.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:41.520]   And he's a letterpress printer in Stone Letter Carver. His father was trained on the
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.800]   Dalmatian coast of Croatia as a stone carver. He said, "My father had two choices. He could go to
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.760]   the sea or he could learn to carve stones and he chose to go to the school to carve stones."
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.080]   And he's like the latter. He's some other letterpress printer in Slovenia, but it's so wild.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.440]   It's a relatively small country. This guy is a shop in downtown Ljubdjana and he has beautiful
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:08.320]   work and he has crammed the entire capability of letterpress printing into this tiny workshop he has.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.400]   And he's in there on a weekend working away on some books for somebody. And it's like,
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.520]   what is it like to be the last... In other countries, in America, there's a lot of interest
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.320]   in letterpress. There's movements, there's colleges, whatever. It's like he can't ignite any interest
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:27.200]   there. So he's kind of the last person in Slovenia. I was talking about trying to figure out how
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:34.400]   to do a tour. Oh yeah. For press nuts like us. Yeah, go there and eat delicious food. Take the
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:42.080]   funicular up to the Ljubjana castle and ride on the river. And it's a lovely capital of Slovenia.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:47.280]   Top notch. You can hear more about this trip if you're a member of Club Twit. That's right.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:55.200]   Our side chat that I hosted with Mr. Glitflyschen. I went to every technology museum I could.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.160]   The German technology museum in the Deutsche Technik Museum has an incredible place. You could
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.800]   spend days there and I went to the printing floor of course and met a wonderful fellow who was
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.520]   covered in tattoos and piercings. And I was like, I know I'm going to like this guy because
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.960]   if you meet printers are usually either covered in tattoos and piercings are looked like me.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.800]   Just absolutely bland in every way. And so we had a great conversation about flong and
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.600]   printing techniques and lithography and the history of things and he showed me cool stuff and they
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.200]   have an amazing typewriter collection and like, wait, I know that typewriter. It was like a rare
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.240]   1800s thing that was made in Denmark. Anyway, it was speaking of typewriters. One of the reasons
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.760]   I wanted Glend to be on today is so I can plug something that he's been helping with. You should
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:49.280]   talk about my own. I have in fact right in front of me, I just got today, we did a test print of
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.880]   the book. So this is exclusive, exclusive to Twit live on the air. This is
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:06.960]   we need to add machines and keyboards and beautiful. Oh, I like how this is this heaven.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.800]   Dude, this is going to be in a slip case. It's going to be beautiful. Yeah, this is a and we've
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.240]   using stochastic screening a mod. It's the modern dithered printing and you get let me find the,
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:22.800]   there is a there's a line of typing here. Here we go. Here's the line of type. Oh, that's to my heart.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.440]   And it's printing like I'm an old printing guy where you use half tone dots and you always had
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.800]   a mess with like the angles of things and sizes and whatever is stochastic screening. It's like
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   super high quality dithering. And so you can resolve the dots are super tiny. And so you can read like
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.640]   the type like if I showed you a, I don't know, like there's a picture of someone typing on a piece of
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:50.480]   paper and you can read the paper on their, you know, like this is a good example. You know,
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.160]   this looks like a continuous tone photograph because there's so much detail in it. And this is a
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:02.080]   printed offset printed item. So it's still screen, but it's such a high resolution or?
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.560]   Yeah, it does. It's, it's a use individual. So it's FM screening. It's frequency modulation
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.040]   screening as opposed to amplitude modulation. So the half tone dots are bigger or smaller. And
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.440]   these are a pattern. And when you put the pattern together, you get like, here's, you know, here's
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:24.160]   a centerfold for those in the right age. Anyway, so this is a 32 page preview. We're going to be
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.920]   handing out to select few, maybe as a premium, but yet a month, a marked wishery and I are going
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.440]   to launch this thing. It's his, his baby 1200 pages plus another 100 pages and a third volume.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.200]   It's like, you can go to the site and shift. What's your body fight? That is, oh, you know,
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.680]   what's funny? I don't know. I wasn't involved in design. Marching did a beautiful job of it.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:50.640]   I should know that offhand and I don't know. So very lovely, Sarah. Do you know what software
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:56.800]   they used to lay it out? In design. And marching is a programmer and designer and photographer and
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.080]   and a lot of other things. And he, in design has a JavaScript programming language built in.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:08.160]   It's an old bad version of JavaScript. So he has been wrestling for years and he can write a
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.360]   new draft of this thing or edit it and hit a button and over a period of literally hours on a modern
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:19.600]   Mac, it will relay out the entire book. Wow. It's really beautifully produced the way the function
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:25.040]   keys led was helping him do that. Yeah, it's just beautifully produced. I can't wait to see it. I
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.840]   will absolutely. It's great. We're going to start this about a month. You can sign up now. My little
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.200]   promotion thing. Thank you, Jeff, is that if you go to this site, if you go to shift happen,
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.080]   start site, you can sign up to get a notification when we launched the Kickstarter in about a month.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.040]   This is the book I was talking about. We almost bought paper from a printing papermaker in Germany
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.280]   and that it shipped across the ocean. And it was it was ridiculous. In the end, we're using a
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:54.080]   US printer and domestically produced US paper because it's just so much simpler. And we found a
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.680]   paper we really like. But it was funny. It was like, am I going to fly to a small town in Germany
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.560]   to talk to papermakers? Well, and sadly, and so recently, a lot of these books were printed in
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.440]   China. That was the that was the way to to print these high quality books, Chronicle books and others.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.800]   Yeah. And this is there's a thing called was it in shoring or something or reshoring is like the
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.960]   we were trying to find in we're actually we're going to get a press last year. And printers in
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.520]   America were overwhelmed and the prices were going up because so many publishers had tried to bring
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.640]   books back. Yeah. And so they locked up capacity. So this year's a little bit easier. Nice.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.960]   While we're on this topic, we should go to line a nine. Well, we will. And we would if this were
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:44.400]   democracy, but it's not. So put a pin in it. Please. All right. All right. Or in my in my eye,
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:50.800]   well, whichever the emperor has spoken. Are you sure it's just like it's just like the US house
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.360]   right now? It's not a democracy either. Think of that today. Are you saying I'm Kevin McCarthy?
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.080]   Is that? Yes. Yes. Thank you. We've had hold on to power for dear life. You could be Jim Jordan.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:10.000]   I did want to show you Glenn, because I took my son to Germany in I think it was 2006.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.360]   And here's a picture. I saw your picture at checkpoint Charlie. Here's a picture of Henry,
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.960]   my son when he was a little boy at checkpoint Charlie. Nice. And I made what I did with Henry
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.640]   is I made him pose the Brandon Bergate at the time had a giant diorama. Let me see if I can. Yeah.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:34.080]   Of what it looked like after the war, you can see the actual horses and the gate is just behind
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:44.400]   this, but there was a giant. So I said, look, sad. I sent pictures of my wife from checkpoint
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:49.440]   Charlie. She had been there. My wife was passed through Berlin in 1989 on a long European trip.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.800]   And I think it was after the war, followed, fallen and she got a tiny piece of the wall and
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.960]   that later lost it, unfortunately. But so she was there when things were going a little nuts. And
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:02.160]   I showed her some pictures from checkpoint Charlie today. I'm like, you cannot take a picture without
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:09.840]   KFC or McDonald's or other like there's a subway right over his shoulder, unfortunately. But there's
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:15.040]   also snack Charlie, which is I think that's been there forever. I think that's where you would stop
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.960]   after you crossed over from the Eastern District. Well, I was I was I was in East Germany a couple
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.760]   times. I spent a month there, right? Trying to write a really bad novel. Thank God never got
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:31.040]   published. It was still East Germany. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. How did you go there to write
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:36.800]   a novel? Because it was about Berlin. Oh, okay. He was suffer. It's a suffer for his art. It was
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.800]   there's it's it's up in the closet when I die. The kids could laugh at it, you know,
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:48.480]   but I went over and the thing is you'd come back from this is so capitalistic. You'd come back from
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.520]   East Berlin after, you know, a day there and I would be so I would be grateful to leave
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:59.760]   Kamikola behind and find a choice. Oh, God, Kamikola was so bad. Yeah. Oh, it was terrible. Yeah,
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.400]   this is Jeff told me when I was there, he said, you have to go to Kade, which is the what is it?
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.480]   It's like the cop house. His vestons. Yes, right. So it's the it's the shrine to capitalism. Yes.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.440]   And you went in there and I was it was like it makes you want to tear the entire world down.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.240]   Because it's just all luxury brands. Everything across it. It was still a great meal there. It's a
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:25.760]   wonderful place. The food floor. The food floor is next up. The food floor, the sixth floor.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:31.120]   Sixth floor. So you should think of Germany and great food in the same sense. It has changed.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:38.640]   Yeah. Yeah. Because I love first. Yeah, you know, I go to the worst stand and I got a couple of
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:44.320]   never cheater in mustard with a little bridge and a beer and I'm actually pretty good. I have to
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.040]   I did not have any dinner kebab and I did not have what's the verse you're supposed to have there?
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.320]   No, I don't know how it happened. Corey verse. Corey versus off. I didn't have
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.680]   curry verse. So I don't know. It's really a missing thing. Okay, that's good.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.160]   What I didn't know until I haven't been back to Germany since I learned this.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.360]   I didn't know that labor case, which means liver cheese is neither liver nor cheese.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:12.240]   Ah, I was not a bad thing. I was a bit. What is it? Yeah, what is it? It's meat.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.280]   It's German. So it's meat. Yeah.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:25.040]   I love German food. I my first experience with German food. I was visiting an office in Florida.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.800]   And there was a German restaurant nearby. So I went over there on the whim and I walked in.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.080]   It is a very small little shop and I walked in and there was this flat iron skillet back there
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:42.960]   just just sizzling. And there's this big giant dude blonde haired dude just flipping something
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.760]   in the grease and just going at it and then he's chugging a beer and I was like, I'm going to eat
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:59.200]   here. And it was so good. You found home. All right. Break time. I don't have any ads,
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:07.200]   which is always sad moment on the show. But I do have two house ads I want to tell you about.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.640]   First of all, we're doing our annual survey. We don't track you, but we do like to be able to tell
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:18.080]   something about our audience to advertisers. So the survey is what we tell them. And it's
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.480]   actually very helpful sales tool for us. We don't collect information about you individually. We're
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.280]   not going to ask you for your even for your email or anything like that. It's all in aggregate.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:36.400]   So the address for this year's survey, as you could figure, if you saw the video, it's twitch.tv/survey23.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:41.360]   There's one year later, survey 23. We do this every January. You have the month of January to do it,
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.080]   but please do it quickly if you would. That would help us. In fact, if we get enough
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:51.680]   respondents, we don't have to keep talking about this. We'd like to get about 10 or 20,000
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:57.200]   respondents as a good sample size of our audience. Just to know a little bit about you,
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:01.600]   it shouldn't take long. It's of course completely optional, but it's very helpful to us.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:10.320]   twitch.tv/survey23. No salesman will call. And then the other thing really is something near and
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:16.880]   dear to my heart. I didn't realize this, but we started Club Twit almost two years ago. It was
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.360]   April of... It's been a couple of years. Yeah. I had no idea. April of 2020. It was a big announcement.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.480]   I remember that. Yeah. And it's been growing and growing and growing. This dad got awesome to see
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.240]   to growth. We're so happy that you have joined those of you who have. And we thank the members of
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   Club Twit for making it possible to do many of the things we do these days, including incidentally,
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:45.920]   the special shows that we do on Club Twit. Coming up, we've got Stacey's book club that's coming
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.280]   a week from Thursday. We're going to be doing Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary. I can't wait for that.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.920]   Lisa and I are going to do an insight twit on the 19th. So that's always fun to hear us talk about
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:03.520]   what's going on inside Twit. And when to Dow, who's one of the hosts of all about Android,
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.160]   will be on February 9th, the dance always putting together fun events. Glenn Fleischman was one of
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:14.000]   those events. After the live event, you can listen on our Twit Plus feed. That's where we also put
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.640]   shows that we do for the club only. Things like hands-on Macintosh with Micah Sargent, hands-on
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.280]   windows with Paul Thorett. This week in Space launched in the club, the club members supported
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.360]   it. Once it got big enough, we put it out in public. We're going to add video to that soon,
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.640]   the untitled Linux show, which is Saturdays with Jonathan Bennett. We're going to start
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:40.480]   adding video to that as well, which is exciting. Yeah, it's a chance for us to test stuff that
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:45.600]   can't support itself yet. The club members get to support it. And you'd think after all that,
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:50.320]   that it's going to be expensive. It's not. It's a buck lesson, a blue check on Twitter. It's 7 bucks
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.680]   a month. That's a great deal. You get ad-free versions of all the shows. That means no tracking,
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.960]   no ads, just the show, just the content. You get the Twit Plus feed with special shows we don't put
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.920]   in public. The Giz Fizz is going to be part of that as well. In fact, the Giz Fizz is coming up.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.040]   Its first episode is coming up after this show. Dick D. Bartolos gives Fizz right after Twit.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:17.600]   Twit concludes later this afternoon. All of that, 7 bucks a month. Do me a favor. Go to
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.480]   Twit.tv/clubtwit. Thanks to all of you who've already joined. Actually, there's no point in
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:29.280]   doing that because they're not seeing this because they don't get that. But I do thank you anyway,
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:35.680]   in absentia. And soon you'll be part of that group, right? Twit.tv/club.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:42.080]   I subscribe myself. We gave you a complimentary membership. Did matter. Thanks you.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.800]   Being part of the club, it's about doing it and you all should do it. It really, we're very happy
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.400]   with how it's turned out. And a lot of that's due to Aunt Pruitt, who's her community manager
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.640]   and has made it interesting and fun. Try. Yeah. No, I really appreciate it.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:00.160]   Iridescent Ox in our Discord says, "Big fan of Club Twit Purple Heart."
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.920]   I guess that means he was wounded in action at some point during the Club Twit chats.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:14.960]   I don't know. I don't know. Kind of a lavender heart actually. Okay, lavender is fine.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:21.440]   I love it. The only thing about the Discord is the home of animated gifts or gifts. Yes.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:28.480]   Oh, yes. Yes. All the time. It's really quite entertaining, actually.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:36.000]   And now in Joesbazito makes a meme out of us. Oh, yeah. Live. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   All right. What is it? Line 89. Let's see. It's typewriter relevant. That's all
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.040]   my letters. There's a story about typewriter arts. Oh, well, it's just a lot. I love typography.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:51.280]   I know. People who do this are... You have to do this. I don't understand them. Okay.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.920]   Oh, that's really nuts. It's Instagram. It's from Instagram. It's from Insta. Okay.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:02.400]   This is nuts. He is using a typewriter to do ASCII art of Montpauk Kettle at the barn. This is...
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:08.640]   You go to his Instagram, he knows tons of them. I wasted life. But... Oh, my God. The work.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:14.560]   Oh, I know. It's not. I just... American Gothic. But honestly, don't you think of it as Montpauk Kettle?
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.440]   I mean, who doesn't, right? Well, I forgot you're 97 years old because...
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.560]   So that point out that I got the reference to this one too. You recognize it. What am I saying?
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.440]   I don't say that. Really seriously, I guess you're right that that Montpauk Kettle is probably...
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:37.760]   It's like a 1920s radio show that became like a 1930s movie series. Yeah, I did watch it.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.680]   This is where Leo goes to the YouTube show. He shows the kids what they miss.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:47.360]   Montpauk Kettle was a great movie series. Pretty funny. I love it. But then I like Charlie Chan,
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:52.880]   also, which was some white guy pretending to be Chinese and saying Confucius, say,
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:59.120]   "Moto lives on roof" or something. I don't know. Yeah. It was a different,
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.200]   worth, say, a different time. Oh, my God. Representation. I even remember Charlie Chain.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:09.440]   The actor was Werner Oland. Is it German? I don't know. The guy... The thing I just found out is the
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.880]   guy who played the worst... The worst Nazi in Casablanca was actually one of the greatest
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:23.360]   anti-Nazi Germans in history. He used money he got from his salary in Hollywood to fund anti-nosty
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.560]   causes, anti-fascist causes. Wow. Incredible. But he insisted on playing the worst Nazis.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.120]   You didn't want to see them. Oh, that's good. He was a bad guy. Because he hated Nazis.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:38.080]   He wanted to show them... He said, "I'll never play one and show them at all in a good light."
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:44.720]   He was major Stossa. Major Stossa. Oh, he was awful. Anyway, I read that just the other day.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.920]   It came up as anniversary of his death or something. And a wonderful man married to a Jewish woman,
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.920]   refused gurings or gurbles, no, gurings in treaties about things. Anyway, he risked his life
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:01.600]   to perform in some movies that were anti-Hitler. Was he the one who said that?
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:11.920]   Why did you come to Casablanca, Rick? I came for the waters. But we are in the desert. I was
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:18.800]   mishemed, formed. Yeah, that's a major high-nosty also, the actress's name,
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:24.880]   high-nostyct, a connedled fight, connedled fight, V-E-I-D-T. An incredible, incredible man we should
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:30.480]   know more about. I just did not have any idea. And let's not forget the Swedish American actor
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:36.400]   Warner Olin, who played Charlie Chan. You could show him... Possibly more problematic.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:43.600]   Fast forward a little bit. You can find Peter Sellers playing every race except his own.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:51.920]   It's all sad. Age is very badly. You're too young, Glenn, and certainly you are,
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:59.920]   but Jeff, I grew up in that era. I know it's very wrong to say this, but I kind of miss
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:06.080]   all of those bad races. You also sympathize with Elon Musk. That's kind of a good war.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:13.440]   I still watch blazing saddles and enjoy it immensely. That's good. But you can't say that
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:20.080]   line though, in public anymore, right? Well, that is an interesting debate, though, right?
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.640]   Because that film is... I didn't... Richard Pryor co-wrote the film, and he was supposed to be in it,
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:29.040]   but they could... It was issues with insurance or something to get him cast or the studio.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.680]   So, was it Levon?
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:36.160]   - Levon Levon? - Yeah, he's amazing. It's true. It's true.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:42.000]   All right. But this is... It's an interesting question because...
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.040]   I mean, Gone with the Wind is reprehensible, too. But it's part of our culture.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:54.880]   You got to watch a historic, historic, historic contact. We're just my wife loves holiday in.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:04.000]   And she's like, "Oh, yeah. Well, are we going to skip over the Lincoln's birthday episode,
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.280]   which everyone puts on Blackface. I think when I was a kid, they'd eliminated that holiday.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.720]   They just skipped over it. The Openness got some plot elements. And then as an adult,
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.080]   I watched it. I thought, "What?" Because it was a very elemental...
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.800]   - You can't show Shobu. - She can't show Shobu any fashion.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.720]   - Shobu's full of mystery. - Yeah.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.560]   - And yet it's part of our history. I don't want to bury it. I think what MGM or Turner did,
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:28.640]   eventually with it, was they would put a big disclaimer in front of Gone with the Wind,
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:35.680]   saying, "This is old history. This is not... This is a terrible thing. Slavery was not good.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.960]   These people were not happy." - Yeah. I've never seen that on a few things, actually.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.560]   - As rightly so. - It's not.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.240]   But you shouldn't never watch it, right? Because historically, we should know that that film was
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.560]   made in the influenced opinions. But you shouldn't watch it uncritically or...
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.920]   - That's right. - And you don't want a young person to watch it and think, "Oh, that's..."
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.040]   - Oh, that's beautiful. - And you don't want to watch it.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.600]   - What did you say? - What did you say?
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:01.440]   - Ant, do you like Gone with the Wind? - I never watched it. I never had any interest in it.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:06.480]   I saw bits and pieces of it. Only Gone in the Wind and I enjoyed it was Miss Carol Burnett doing that.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:12.000]   - Oh, yeah. That was actually a much better... - That was actually a much better...
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.720]   - That was actually hilarious. - But let's not forget that it was the...
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.800]   I think the first black person to win an Academy Award...
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.800]   - Yes. - All right. Had a McDaniel who played the slave...
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:31.120]   who helped Miss Scollet make her dress out of curtains.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.960]   - Adam and Curt. - And of course, they're over at the accident that the curtain brought in.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.960]   - That's right. - That's right.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:41.040]   - Yeah, there's a lot of great cinema, but a lot of great black cinema going on in a parallel world,
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.840]   right? At the same time, and fortunately, some of that was preserved too. So we got to see what's
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.800]   happening where... - Where do you say that? I would love to see that.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.040]   - It's YouTube. This is... I mean, oh, so look, don't have your own copyright,
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:57.040]   because I'll get on this, but back a few years ago, right? We just hit the public domain day,
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:04.800]   and so material from '27 and earlier in the US that was published is now completely in the public
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:11.840]   domain. And back in 2019, 2018, I wrote an article for Smithsonian about the first year of that after
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.360]   a 20-year halt because of the Sonny Bono Act that Disney had promoted. There was this gap of 20 years
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.440]   before anything entered the public domain. And so one of the things that Smithsonian had me do was
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:27.440]   like, let's talk about the cultural impact. And a lot of folks I spoke to said the Harlem Renaissance
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:33.920]   was cutting down. So it started in the 1922, but it didn't really blossom until later in the '20s.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.000]   So because a lot of the rights were owned by publishing houses that didn't want to publish it,
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.840]   or they let it go out of print and they wouldn't allow it, or there were a lot of orphaned rights,
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:46.880]   you didn't know who owned the rights. So the Harlem Renaissance lay kind of fallow, and now it's being,
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.920]   I haven't seen the real reevaluation you need to for that era, but because some of the stuff
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:55.520]   did remain in print, we know some of the best works from the time. But some of the stuff is also
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.880]   just now because it's in the public domain, it's not like, oh, you can share it freely or remix it.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.000]   It's also, you can literally publish new editions or put PDFs up of these books that were just,
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.320]   you'd have to go to a specific library to get a copy. And the same thing with film, we're going
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.680]   to see this incredible explosion of black cinema from the '30s and '40s that was hidden because nobody
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:20.720]   knows who owns it or someone doesn't want to deal with copyright issues to get it out there.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.600]   There's a good article from last year, University of California, public domain expansion,
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.440]   last year highlights of the Harlem Renaissance and Modernist writers in
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:38.160]   Haffey Trust's newly opened volumes. Yeah, so he asks why were people unrepresented in certain
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.320]   eras in American culture? It's partly because we can't see them easily. It's a copy road to a
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.400]   library. Yeah, you have to go to a library or a film institute to see stuff because it's just
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.600]   not in speculation. I think I mentioned this last episode, but some of the public domain works
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:57.600]   that are now available, "Bessie Smith's Songs," "Songs by Louis Armstrong," "Puttin' on the Ritz,"
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:03.840]   "Puttin' on the Ritz," and "Ice Cream, We All Scream for Ice Cream." And "The Jazz Singer," the
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.200]   totally unproblematic movie of the "Jazz Singer." Oh, Lord. Oh, yeah. Nothing.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:15.120]   Al Jolson in Blackface. You ain't seen nothing yet. Oh my god. It's a... Yeah. Well, it's important
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.760]   we examine these things. We don't want to be very intelligent. It is America still. As long as
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.320]   you're contextualized. Yeah. Yeah. Learn something. I think, I mean, wait, I mean, look, not to get
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:27.840]   two on this, but it's like it's important to understand how deeply embedded white Americans
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.560]   were in watching the minstrel sea for such a long period of one of the most popular forms of culture,
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.320]   and I think it explains more about American history than we want to understand as,
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.360]   as white people, that this is true, and it's all suppressed because it's unacceptable
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.920]   instead of being studied. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I'll get off my hobby horse now.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:54.800]   Next year, Mickey Mouse. Unless Sunny Boto comes back to life. And see, and I thought that was
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:01.600]   this year. It's so hard to track, though, isn't it? It's like, according to Duke, which does this
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.440]   page every year for Public Domain Day, the first appearances of Mickey and Minnie Well,
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.920]   end of the Public Domain next year, January 1st. And this is character.
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.840]   Steamboat Willie, right there. Yeah. But only that depiction. I mean,
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.360]   Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain a year ago. As long as he's not wearing a red coat.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:21.840]   Yeah. So we have that. There's a horror film like a slasher horror film about Winnie the Pooh.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:28.880]   That's out. But he can't wear. He has to be naked because Disney owns the Winnie the Pooh
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:32.880]   with the red shirt. That's why Bambi entered the public domain last year. Good.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.960]   Mickey Mouse. Yeah. I mean, so the question is, it was a good, very good New York Times article
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.800]   about Steamboat Willie entering the public domain. And Mickey Mouse and Minstrel
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.480]   see as a whole other subject. I swear to God, I'll start talking about it. Anyway, the White
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:52.960]   Gloves. It's a hmm. Anyway. So do you think Mickey Mouse was supposed to be Blackface?
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:57.520]   Mickey Mouse is Blackface. There's some really good academic articles about
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.680]   the White Gloves, the exaggerations. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's for sure.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:10.160]   Wow. Yep. Yeah. It's a whole, there's a whole book about it. In fact, that's really eye-opening
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:15.360]   about American culture. American culture. What do we love? And that's what we lose when we don't
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.960]   talk about this stuff is how if you if you want to, you know, get rid of systemic racism,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.520]   you have to recognize it. Mickey Mouse is Blackface. Oh my God.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.080]   At least in what Willie will say. It's shifted over the years. The modern depiction less so.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.440]   But if you look, there are different eras and there's some, but there's some really good academic
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:38.080]   work on it. But, but so Mickey Mouse, the question the New York Times raised, I think at a really
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.920]   solid article about the nuance of Steamboat Willie entering the public domain is Mickey Mouse's
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.080]   trademarked and all of Mickey Mouse's later appearances and everything he said and every
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:53.920]   character trait is still under copyright from 19, you know, after next year from 1929 on. So
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.320]   Disney may aggressively defend the copyright and be like, oh, you know, we have a trademark
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:03.680]   derivative. Yeah. So this happened with Sherlock Holmes, but the last Sherlock Holmes stories that
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:09.280]   were copyrighted under US law went to the public domain this January 1st. So now you can write about
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.960]   Sherlock Holmes owning a dog and having human emotions because those appear in the last.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:20.000]   And you mentioned before the show, Jeff, but it's worth re mentioning that Canada is expanding
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:26.480]   its copyright term, which is currently life plus 50 to life plus 70.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.960]   It says because of the free trade agreements. I have to regularize.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.520]   But Michael Geist, who is, I think, a very smart
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:48.320]   and salient attorney who writes about Canadian law says it is massive loss to education
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:52.080]   and to the public. And one of the other things about this is that Canada
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:40:00.960]   cares so deeply about Canadian content. Yeah. And so they've cut off 20 years of Canadian
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:08.880]   content that could be out there and be useful. Yeah. He says the Canadian term extension would
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.600]   cost Canadian education millions of dollars with delay works entering the public domain for an
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.800]   entire generation yet 20 more years. Even worse, the government chose to do so without
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:24.560]   mitigation measures to reduce the economic cost and cultural harm comes from term extensions.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.000]   That is unfortunate. Christ has also been covering the
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.840]   Canadian versions of the Australian law. You know, the whole protectionism and copyright.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.800]   It's as bad in Canada as it is in the US. Well, and as long as we're talking about racism,
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:48.640]   let's talk about face recognition, which once again is the culprit in arresting a black person
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:55.040]   who did not commit a crime instead of enjoying a late Thanksgiving meal with his mother in Georgia,
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.880]   Randall Reed spent nearly a week in jail in November. Oh my God.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:05.760]   Fosly identified as a luxury purse thief by Louisiana, face authorities using face recognition
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:13.120]   technologies is according to NOLA.com. I'm reading from the article on common dreams.org.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:21.440]   They actually didn't want to disclose the fact that they used face recognition, but they did.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:28.640]   And the sad, you know, the really sad stories is this guy is, you know, he's spent a week in jail
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:34.000]   and there's no compensation for that wild. He had nothing to do with it. Randall Reed was
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.080]   arrested in the June theft of luxury purse. This is from a meta-re consignment shop,
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:48.160]   even though he never been to Louisiana. They pulled him over as he drove on interstate 20
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:55.920]   into Calcab County, Georgia, headed to Thanksgiving with his mom. He said, they told me I had a warrant
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:01.120]   out of Jefferson Parish. I said, what's Jefferson Parish? I've never been to Louisiana day in my
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.960]   life. Then they told me it was for theft. So not only have I not been to Louisiana, I also don't steal.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:13.520]   He was booked into the Calcab County jail as a fugitive, not let go until a week later
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:21.520]   without any apology. They tacitly admitted the error and rescinded the July warrant.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:30.480]   Good. Hope he catches Sue. Yeah. Good lawyer. We've talked many times about face recognition.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:35.120]   You know, when we came back into the country a couple of days ago, there's a big sign saying,
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:40.240]   we're going to take your picture now. But don't worry. We're going to delete it from our databases
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:46.160]   if you're a US citizen within 12 hours. But you ferners are going to keep it forever.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:50.000]   And they even said something. I should have taken a picture except they would have arrested me.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:57.840]   You don't have to. But something like, but don't worry, it'll be safely stored by the federal
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:04.240]   government. So yeah, Han Wavy. So yeah, they're using now face recognition of everybody who comes
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:09.680]   in the United States. And the CPD officer said, okay, ladies first, Lisa, stand in front of the
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.920]   camera, take your picture. And it took my picture. God knows what I used when I traveled. I used the
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:21.440]   because I traveled a hell of a lot. So I used all the things I could use. But the global entry,
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.960]   what the machine, to the picture of me every single time. Yeah. And if you're interested in,
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.880]   you specifically did the I had Nexus, which includes global entry. First time I got to use it.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:38.480]   And I did the picture thing and I walk up and in Montreal to come back through
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.400]   past New Montreal. And the guy, cousin, guy kind of looks at like, you scan your face. I'm like,
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   yeah, he's like, okay. Wow. All right. That was a little less. That was nothing. That was a
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.520]   mission. There you go. That's right. Like, yeah, no, no. He said, did you? He was just asking,
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.280]   you looked at my ID. He looked at me as like, did you have your face scanned? I said, yeah. All right.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.760]   All right. Come on in. We know you're okay. To the Cordol Sanote.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:09.200]   Yeah. Just the whole unintended consequences of this facial recognition, because when it works,
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:15.200]   it could work very well to solve some problems, especially with crime and find an actual right
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.640]   person. Sure. And then you're gonna have issues like this where mistakes are going to happen.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:28.000]   We I got a message from on a Macedon a while back. I could never remember how to say her name.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.600]   This is Adrana Langston. Oh, Adriana Langston. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's great. Yeah. I really like her.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:42.880]   And she shared a story about metalogics. Basically, a gentleman decided to come up with a way to help
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:51.440]   fill in the gaps in the AI where the AI has doesn't have enough data trained far as capturing
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.720]   people to look like me, black men, people of color. That's the problem. Sure. But at the same time,
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:01.840]   you know, there's that bit of a panic out there. Like, I don't want my head to you want to volunteer.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.840]   Yeah. Right. We need more. Come on. Come on over. Let's take your picture. Right. So, so, so,
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:15.520]   where's the balance here? I totally support putting more data in there. But I can't speak for everybody
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:21.040]   out there. I think the risk of false positives in a case like this is so great that it's just not
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:25.120]   it shouldn't be used. And a lot of jurisdictions, including the city of San Francisco,
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:28.400]   have basically banned the use of facial recognition by law enforcement.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.760]   Law enforcement, there's so many things law enforcement could do to make its job easier.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:39.360]   They could put cameras in everybody's houses and watch for illegal activities. Wait, wait, what?
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.320]   Well, they could. And it would and it would have a salutary effect on reducing crime.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:48.480]   But I don't think we want that. So we really have just a little, little, little part advocating
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:56.640]   for cameras. You know, that TV set should be a two way street. Oh, wait a minute.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.160]   You saw the January. The insurrection thing was fascinating, though, because there was this
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:07.360]   crowd source motion to identify people who were in pictures from the January 7th and
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.920]   Suraction. That was also problematic. Yeah, it was problematic. But here is the interesting part
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.360]   there versus say we took a picture of a random person and we told the all the police everywhere,
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.520]   we didn't get tell you didn't tell you where you got the ID from and arrest this person, right?
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:27.120]   This was a lot of people independently as well as the government agencies are trying to ID folks.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:32.320]   Some of the independent folks were using different forms of facial matching and systems and then
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:37.680]   they would call the FBI or present it. The FBI then did the legwork. So as far as I can tell,
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:43.680]   I haven't heard any cases amazingly out of like was almost a thousand people have been charged
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:49.360]   in various forms. And so far, and I haven't heard a single case where it was like the FBI went out
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.600]   and they're like, Oh, that's not me in that photo. And maybe it's happened. But I think there was
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.200]   an enormous amount of deliberative process to winnow down and get the right people and present it
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.960]   in an effective way in court as opposed to arrest a bunch of people all at once. And also,
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:07.280]   there's let's face it a long standing tradition of if you have a picture of somebody committing a crime,
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.200]   put it out and say, Anybody know this guy? That's right. I mean,
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:16.400]   that's what it's all different people committing a crime. And of course, you know, we've had wanted
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:21.600]   posters on the walls of post offices for as long as I can. And Europeans think we're nuts about that.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.560]   Yeah. The the the what I was in the daily news, I learned about the perp walks, right? You know,
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.640]   when the purpose is going to get walked out of Europe, they just they just I remember when when a
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.600]   former French official, you know, was was accused of raping somebody in a hotel in New York and
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:41.520]   the perp walk. Oh, yeah. And and France was just up at arms as they show his face as they should be,
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:48.640]   because this person is is is accused. They're not convicted. There's another argument that says
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.280]   that more transparency and openness in our criminal justice system is important,
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:59.040]   because if you hide who the people are, right, and others don't know it. So in Germany, you know,
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:04.480]   they put the black squares against the eyes and they don't reveal names and on all of that. So
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:09.840]   there's there's an opacity to the yeah, I mean, we have a tradition of you get tried in an open
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:15.280]   court, right? People go see it. And I think that that's appropriate as long as everybody
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.400]   understands your innocent that's the issue. Yeah. Although you got to love when the person with
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:26.080]   that notorious Twitter account lives of TikTok went on Tucker Carlson, exposed her face for the
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:32.240]   first time. There she is allegedly. Yeah, we'll show the area. She is allegedly one of the January
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:37.440]   six insurrections. They had a legend. She got she got you see the horrible Idaho case.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:46.400]   That evidently the way the police tracked the accused murder was through DNA and open public.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:54.240]   They didn't have his DNA, but they were able to go to genealogy places with relatives DNA.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:59.520]   And then cross and that's not the first time that people arrested that way.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.800]   Golden State killer. That's right. That was a big story. Yeah. Yeah. There's been a but well,
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.640]   there was this there was this long-running theory that if serial killers never stopped right until
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.960]   they're caught or died or were imprisoned, it turns out it's not true. And a lot of the DNA stuff
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:18.400]   is finding people who did terrible acts sometimes 20, 30, 40 years ago and then stop doing them for
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:23.360]   some, you know, whatever psychological thing drives them and they get found. You are one
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:28.640]   son. Sorry. Fun stuff. Do what happens when we have no commercials. We get very depressed.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:33.600]   Tell you what I'm priming. Here's some good news from the FBI. Even the FBI says,
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.240]   you should use an ad blocker. That's hysterical. That's great. That's great.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:44.320]   In a pre-holiday public service announcement, the FBI said that cyber criminals are buying ads
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:50.080]   to impersonate legitimate brands like cryptocurrency exchanges legitimate in their quotes.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:54.960]   Ads are often placed at the top of search results, but with minimum distinction between the ads
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:01.840]   and the search results. So one of the recommendations might want to install an ad blocker.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:08.880]   Cyber criminals impersonating brands using search engine advertisement services to defraud users.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:16.160]   There's a headline guarantee to drive engagement. Yep. Actually, I'm glad that the FBI has yet to
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.600]   discover link bait. That's probably a good thing. Top, did any of you get the package tracking
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:28.000]   fishing? I got over holidays. I was expecting a DHL package from which I don't know if I get
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.360]   DHL stuff. I got an email in boxing. It says, DHL, your package is delayed. And I go,
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:40.240]   I'll just click. I've been expecting that. Damn it. I was like, that's not how you
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:47.120]   sell DHL. So easy. So easy to fall. So easy, especially how was it spelled, by the way?
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.480]   Was it? I was kidding. I was kidding. Because it did all the logos, but it was full of typos.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:59.040]   And then the URL was like, DHL package, solar, lower age 7395, you know, all hidden behind a
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:04.160]   nice looking link. Did you see the movie yesterday, the film about, I love this movie,
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:09.760]   a guy who hits his head in a bicycle accident wakes up in a world in which the Beatles never
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:15.280]   existed, realizes I know all the Beatles song starts performing them as if he wrote them,
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:22.560]   becomes a huge superstar, wonderful movie. Maybe you saw the trailer, which featured
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:30.800]   one Anna Dearmis, who everybody loves, as the love interest in this movie. But she was cut
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:36.400]   out of the release because they decided that, well, you know, he shouldn't have a secondary
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:41.600]   love interest. This is a love story. But it was, but she was in the trailer.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:51.520]   And Dearmis fans have now sued, saying it's a deceptive movie trailer. We went, they filed
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.720]   lawsuit alleging they had rented the movie after seeing Dearmis in the trailer. All of the
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:01.120]   discovers she was cut out of the final film. Universal sought to throw out the lawsuit saying,
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:07.920]   hey, it's movie trailers are entitled to brought protection under the first amendment. The studios
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:13.520]   argued the trailer is an artistic expressive work. And that should be considered non commercial
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:18.800]   speech. The judge said, no, no, the trailer is a commercial is commercial speech subject to the
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:26.160]   California false advertising law and the state's on gun competition law. You can't you can't
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.320]   advertise something. But if anybody who goes to movies knows it happens all the time,
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:34.240]   there's stuff in the trailer that never happened. The trailer is a bit more more than quotes.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:39.760]   I used to be when I was a former TV critic, as you know, and I would say what a colossal waste
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.160]   of time and the quote would be colossal Jeff Jarvis TV guy. I know I'm always going to step
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.200]   every time you say that. I know you were a former TV critic because when I was a small child,
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:53.120]   I used to read you and I'm a younger, younger, and every two years old when I was reading in
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:53:00.400]   a little drawing of Jeff Jarvis and I go, I'm so excited to see this week's issue.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:07.600]   The plaintiffs each paid $3.99 to rent yesterday on Amazon Prime. By the way,
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:14.160]   I'm just going to say even without an arm is worth the $3.99. They're seeking $5 million as
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:19.120]   representatives. Is this her is this her mother and father? Who is this? I don't know. I don't
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:26.240]   get 90 cents back. 90 cents back each. Yeah. Yeah. 309. So the judges ruled that lawsuit can
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:33.680]   go ahead. I just I found that amusing. But the judge was very careful to say, look,
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:38.080]   this is only in the case of an actor shown in the trailer not appearing in the film.
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.960]   You can't say that that joke didn't appear in the film. That's that's too far. There are some limits
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:48.400]   to this. Now there was a story and I think we should report it because for a long time,
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:53.920]   Jeff, you and I have a defending TikTok. But there was a story while we were gone
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:54:00.560]   that by dance and they admitted this by dance found that employees had obtained the user data
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:06.320]   of two journalists. They were trying to figure out where leaks were coming from. So they got the
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:15.200]   location information from the journalists who were using TikTok to see if the leakers,
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:23.280]   anybody connected to TikTok spoke to those reporters. They were trying to determine if the
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:29.360]   journalists were within proximity of bite dance employees. Those efforts failed to find any leaks,
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:37.760]   by the way. Bright dance. The general employees were fired, but they revealed that it happened.
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.800]   All four employees in the scheme were fired. The company said correcting an earlier statement
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.040]   that one of the four had resigned. Two of the employees working in China, two in the United
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:54.000]   States, by the way. Bite dance says it's restructured its internal audit and risk team
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.080]   and removed any access to US data from that department. But it does lend a lot of ammunition
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.880]   to those people saying we got a ban bite dance. We got a TikTok.
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:14.880]   What do you think? I thought about the whole banning TikTok story last week during
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:21.920]   bowl week. College football bowl week as halftime rolled up and ESPN puts up,
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.640]   hey, coming up at halftime, I'm going to talk about this and that. And the very top banner,
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:34.480]   if you look online, 138, it shows brought to you by TikTok. And I'm like, how is this even possible
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:41.120]   considering so much pushback here in the US leadership about TikTok? It was the TikTok
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:48.240]   halftime report. Yeah. Wow. But I've seen a lot of TikTok ads. They've actually ramped up their
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:56.080]   ads spending in the face of this threat as they should. Well, okay. So I guess it's the end of
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:02.400]   the day money talks. Sure. It's an advertiser. It's not illegal. It's under suspicion.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:10.080]   All this, all this. That's a bad story. But the moral panic going on there you go. And I should
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:15.520]   have given you a warning. Take it. Like moral panic. Put the button. Thank you very much
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:21.120]   about, you know, government saying you can't use AA who uses TikTok as part of their job.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.760]   It's gonna be got a really boring job. You want to take a look? Okay. But B,
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:28.240]   we're not thinking through the harm here. You know, what is what is what is what is
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:33.600]   all the Chinese old and bad things can happen. That's it's being the whole internet has been
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.160]   politicized in this way. Yeah, but yeah, it takes away expression for people. I understand.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.560]   Go look at the other side of this. I agree. And I don't think banning TikTok is the answer. But
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.080]   there's got to be some controls. By the way, this could have happened from Instagram. It could have
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.800]   happened. But I'll just say this is the same type of access could happen with the the app said
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:56.480]   are homegrown here in the US. And in fact, that's why I said two of the employees were US based.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:02.080]   So it's line number Uber and Sarah Lacey remember that the God many years ago that that was part
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:07.120]   of the thing that almost ended kind of was part of the beginning of the end for for well, at least
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:12.480]   the head of Uber at the time. Yeah, they had that God but they had used that many times before.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:17.440]   They had used that many times before, for instance, when fighting with the regulators in New York
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:24.720]   City, they banned if you asked for a cab for an Uber in New York City and they knew who you were
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.200]   and you were a regular person. Or they fed you a different version of the app.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:35.520]   Which is amazing. Cycling back just one second, the facial recognition thing, you know that some
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:41.600]   lawyers have been banned from venues owned by the Madison Square Garden because it's a huge
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:45.680]   story. Yes. But I was just thinking this is that combination is like facial recognition
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:53.760]   being banned from a surface. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. MSG really overstepped on that.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.400]   Yeah. But it's the tick. But tick tock. I mean, this is the is a little bit of that interactions
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.480]   like they're tracking or they were sensibly tracking people where they were. They knew about
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:08.000]   too much information about them based on. So there's a there is a solution here. I mean, first of all,
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.720]   your platform, your mobile platform should do as Apple does, should block that kind of thing or at
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.560]   least give you information and give you the opportunity to block that kind of thing. You
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:25.920]   shouldn't have automatic location tracking without your permission ever. So I know Apple does that.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:32.400]   Let's hope it's actually Apple's strongly enforcing it. And I don't know if Google does that.
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:38.800]   Google, of course, has been accused of and I think properly convicted of doing the same thing,
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:44.640]   but ignoring the setting and still tracking you got to do something about that. This your
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:49.520]   your location information is important and it should be able you should be able to protect that, I think.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:58.400]   Of course, one of the reasons perhaps that TikTok is being maligned is because this article
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:06.000]   from the Wall Street Journal, Google and meta is advertising dominance fades as TikTok and streamers
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.480]   emerge. If they're they're taking money out of the mouths of those poor people.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.760]   What do we say about duopoly and monopoly and nothing can happen?
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:23.120]   There's competition out there, including by the way TikTok. And so you go on an unintended
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:27.680]   consequences department, you ban TikTok, you give more power to Google and Facebook.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:32.320]   And by the way, if you look at the graph, and this is the Wall Street Journal, which always
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:38.720]   takes any shot they can at competitors, if you look at the graph of share of US digital advertising
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:45.040]   revenue from 2014 through 2023. Can you show that? Oh, I wait a minute. I have a button. Oops.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:52.400]   Oh, two people press the button in trouble. Look at this little slice that TikTok takes
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:59.520]   compared to the big slide. Oh, yeah, Google down just a little bit there. Oh, TikTok. Oh,
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:04.880]   you can't even I can't even hover over it. It's so small. 2.5% of the market estimated.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:12.000]   But Amazon Z beys Amazon 12 Amazon's revenue is now bigger than the magazine industry world one.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.200]   Advertising revenue. Advertising. Oh, Amazon. You don't even think of that as an advertising
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:21.360]   to know. Yeah, it's well, you want to get a thing when I get a cable that short circuits when
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:27.600]   you buy it, where do you go? You go to a sponsored link on Amazon. Okay, we haven't said anything
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:33.920]   about Elon Musk. Good. I don't I don't remember who this is. So we just I think this is a shot.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.600]   This is no, this is a shot in Freud opportunity. First person in history to lose 200 billion,
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:45.120]   although that's a kind of not not really true because it was paper money. Never. It's it's still
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:50.800]   unrealized gains is that's kind of meaningless. It's not like he had $200 billion in his pocket
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:57.360]   and misplaced it. Has he lost more money for for other people more money than anybody else has
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:01.360]   a history for other people? Because I was thinking it might be Zuckerberg because meta went down
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:05.680]   seven or something billion. I think if you look at all of all of his holdings,
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:14.480]   Tesla's down over 65%. That's like a failure. Fidelity slashed their book value on Twitter by half.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.560]   This we knew was going to come and it's going to come from the banks too who have lent him money
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:22.160]   that they're going to start getting this stuff off the books because they know it's it's a loss.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:29.360]   Twitter is not paying its rent now. And Elon has decided not to buy toilet paper.
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:33.840]   So we've heard that Twitter employees now have to bring their own.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.800]   You know what he's installed fiber in all the buildings.
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:49.200]   Where's that real shot? And apparently because because they're they're not they fired the
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:57.200]   janitors a month ago and nobody will go across the picket lines. Twitter's San Francisco HQ,
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:04.960]   a hub of stinky smells. It's a good headline. Also Twitter. It's you know the service,
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:11.280]   the real world and the digital this is from the San Francisco Chronicle. And by the way,
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:17.600]   Elon, you should never have gotten that Ironman costume because that's all we're going to ever see
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:25.200]   from now on. They have there without janitorial services for a month. If we cut janitorial services
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.400]   for a month, I can tell you it will be worse down here. Sitting during a garbage strike.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:37.600]   According to the New York Times, the offense staff no offense, but yeah, but you're right.
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:43.680]   None taken the offices in disarray. No, I'm the worst. I throw food in my garbage all the time.
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.080]   The offices in disarray with people packed into more confined spaces. The smell of leftover
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:54.400]   takeout food and body odor has lingered on the floors. According to four current and former employees,
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:03:00.720]   bathrooms have grown dirty. These people said remaining workers reportedly bringing their own
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:10.160]   toilet paper. What's wrong with this guy? I don't feel sorry for him anymore.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:17.440]   They've been evicted from my Seattle. Seattle they close Seattle. They're facing a victim.
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:20.880]   And so there's sort of it sounds like they're shutting down the office here.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.960]   Mr. LaPorte, you said you don't feel sorry for him anymore. You felt sorry?
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:28.880]   Don't you remember two episodes ago? Two episodes ago. I felt so bad for you.
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:35.760]   And I kept going after as a result. Oh, man. I honestly, that's good. I mean, look,
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:43.600]   he's going through something. He's like, he's a human. He's a human being. I feel bad for him.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.000]   He's obviously having true, you know, he's upset. He's there's something wrong in his brain.
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:53.200]   It's sad. I mean, I feel worse for people who love Twitter and who have lost something very,
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:04:01.200]   very valuable. Yeah, that's a terrible shame. But that's on how long he's still in charge of it
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.640]   in terms of the debt thing. Like he's been selling off between selling off Tesla stock after promising
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:13.920]   not to the decline in Tesla value. Mr. Fleischman, only because he can and no one's going to hold
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.040]   his feet to the fire for us. No, the banks aren't going to come after him.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.640]   Well, wait, wait, wait. Now here's where I think happens. The equity holders lose,
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:29.840]   the Saudis lose, but the banks put in $13 billion, which is about what Twitter is worth.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:35.200]   And so at the end of the day, if the debt holders end up out of bankruptcy, owning Twitter,
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:39.280]   and ain't a bad deal for them. How did Alden take over the newspaper industry in the US?
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:44.080]   Mm. They bought their bad debt. Okay. Meanwhile,
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:51.040]   Mastodon now is up to 9 million active users or users. You account. I think that's active.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.800]   So you're right. You don't know if they do they have a I mean, there's no central anything.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:58.720]   So we don't know. No, necessarily the way this information comes from scraping.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:05.280]   I mean, you can go to you can go to twitter.social and see how many users we have. I know how many
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:12.880]   active users we have that is information is available to Mastodon administrators. So I don't know,
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:16.160]   I don't know where they're getting that 9 million. What's the location likely,
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:21.920]   Oh, well, you could see right here. And every Mastodon administrator has this, this dashboard.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:29.040]   We have almost 5,000 active users, which is, you know, it's up 2% from last week. But you know,
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.000]   this is just a week's worth of information. How many accounts?
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:39.200]   Yeah, I can tell you. So that's what was that? Remember that almost 5,000. And the total account
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:45.680]   number. What do you do with that? That's personal. Let's go to the administrative interface
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:54.880]   and look at the accounts. Oh, I can't remember how to do this. Let's see. I go to this dashboard here.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:59.520]   Like this button here. Yes, Jake's running his own, isn't he?
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:06.640]   He's running his own. He's working for Hugo too. Yeah. Oh, he is the runner owner of Mastodon host.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:12.320]   Master host. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's Mastodon is, uh,
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:17.040]   that's becoming a lot like the best parts of Twitter. It's a little quieter. I love it. It's not
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:21.280]   even quite longer in some respects. Well, yeah, you're right. It's not. I don't find it as much
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:25.520]   enough. I mean, I'm following. Well, I'll tell you the funny thing is, you know, look, I have no,
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:30.400]   my social media presence is you got a Glen F. You look down there. There's an at Glen F there. Oh,
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.440]   that's my old. Well, it's at Glen F. You have a lot of Glen F. That's true. Well,
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:40.080]   when I was everywhere. Yeah. At Glen F at Twitter. Social, I should say. But, uh, I have, I'm now
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.280]   at like closing on a third of the number of people following me on Mastodon as on Twitter,
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:49.440]   which is bizarre to me. It means that there, I mean, people are finding me or following me or
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:55.600]   whatever. And it's, it's great. But I post something. I took something on Mastodon that I think is
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:59.600]   mild, interesting or funny or whatever. And it's like, whoa, like dozens of people, hundreds of
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:04.160]   people respond. And I'm like, this wasn't happening on Twitter. People are a little more bored. There's
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:11.200]   less going on. So if you do something, yeah, a little more, but more like an autopilot, far
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:17.440]   as social media goes, I am literally just throwing stuff in an automatic queue and walking away. I'm
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:24.560]   not really checking. You don't see that I, but I boost you. I boost you all the time. I can't say
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.520]   that I've been looking, sir. It's just, it's just the, I guess it's a mood I've been in here recently.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:36.560]   I just sort of stay, just stay in a way. Cause it just don't feel right nowadays. It's healthy, though.
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:42.480]   I signed up for friendica too today. To whom? Friendica, which is their version of the, the
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:49.840]   activity pub. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's pretty nice. Actually, so I'm friendly Jeff Jarvis there.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.320]   Yeah. We ran an identical server for a long time. That was the Twitter army server.
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:00.160]   So activity pub is, you know, been around since 2007, I think, almost as old as Twitter.
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:05.840]   And there have been a variety of Twitter-like iterations, including identity, then status,
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:13.200]   net and a canoe, social as activity pub. There's a lot of this is a very rich arena, actually,
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:17.280]   it turns out. Mass time gets all the attention. But there's a lot of it.
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:23.120]   Sounds like a, sorry, friendica sounds like a very mellow, uh, strain of marijuana. Yeah.
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.560]   I'm on fun to go right now. It's makes me feel, makes me happy.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:34.960]   It's very relaxing. Hey, let's do a quick, uh, oh, one other mess down the street I should mention.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:43.840]   Uh, of course, VCs have now flocked to mess it up. And the creator of mess it on, uh, who has so far
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:51.040]   turned down all offers and says he has no plans on selling out. And he pays himself only, I think,
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:58.240]   3000 euros a month. Yeah, which is very, uh, a G, GMBH, which I had to look up. So the G,
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:03.680]   GBMH is the game, beha, right? It's the German. It's like a, in court, like a limited liability
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:11.920]   company, a corporation, but a G, GMBH is a GBMH. Sorry. It's, it's company with limited liability is
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:15.840]   the nonprofit version. I was like, oh, I didn't realize that. So it's like, I think it's,
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:19.760]   is it a public benefit corporation style or is it five one to see three or?
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:24.880]   It seems like a slightly different animal. So it's, it's, I don't think there's a direct,
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:29.440]   I mean, it's nonprofit. I think they, uh, have to conform to different rules than a corporation
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:35.360]   is, but it's kind of, it seems more similar to like an LLC than a nonprofit company would be
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:39.760]   in America, a nonprofit organization would be here. So I think they have more flexibility in what
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.000]   they do, but it also, they have to conform to, to rules that ensure they're not spending money in
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.960]   the other thing that's very good news. Uh, and you should keep in mind is even if we can decide,
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:52.560]   Oh yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna cash out and I'm gonna get Mark entries and to give me a billion
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:57.520]   dollars. Nobody would care. We would fork. Yeah. It's open source, right? We'd fork it.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:02.560]   And we'd just go on and say, if I have fun, I can take your money and run. Uh, but we will continue
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:08.560]   to run an open source version of a mastodon without it. And I think there'd be plenty of people
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:13.920]   who would take it over and keep it running, including Hugo, who runs Masto host. I think that's, and
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:19.040]   you're your son. Uh, I don't think that's a problem. So here's friendica. So you said you liked it?
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:24.480]   Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, it's different. So, um, but you can't see it unless you sign in.
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:29.600]   Right. Um, uh, you should sign up for it because it does have Facebook pieces, right? You can put
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:35.440]   up photos, media, and, and, and so on. I mean, I don't, I don't want to confuse people and have,
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:39.280]   but they search for Jeff Jarvis. They, you know, they, they, they finally follow me there. So I just,
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:43.600]   I'm kind of giving pretty sparse. Oh, I see. But I wanted to see what it was like. And the other
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:50.000]   way I could see it was by signing up. Nice. Um, it's nice. I signed up for, um, uh, I forgot to
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.240]   know the name of it is. So, so I was very egotistical. Let me know. I followed myself twice.
[02:10:54.240 --> 02:11:01.520]   That's crazy. Yeah. That's what I had to do with, um, pixel fan. I had to do that. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:06.800]   I'm on pixel fed. Uh, friendica has, uh, a lot of servers actually there.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:12.960]   238 servers. Not as many as Mastodon, which slipped, I think 9,000 or something. 123 English
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:21.200]   language servers. Um, many of which are actually not in the, uh, US, um, but it looks like a lot of
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:28.560]   German, uh, hosts. Interesting. This is a very interesting. I mean, I saw some in post a chart of
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.040]   the federated or the Fediverse. Oh, yeah. And it was one of those. I mean, when they post,
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:37.440]   people put those large charts together of like the advertising industry, digital advertising
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:40.800]   infrastructure. And sometimes you're like, I don't even understand what some of these tiers are,
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:45.680]   right? There's 47,000 companies and the Fediverse is nowhere near that big, but it's kind of
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:51.360]   delightful to start seeing these different kinds of aspects of it. Yeah. Silt out all of with that
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.000]   same, I mean, I don't know. It's, I, people are very dubious about it because of onboarding. And I
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.040]   think onboarding seems to be a problem that will be solved if it reaches a certain point because
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:06.640]   people will make their own kind of thing, probably with paid options. That is an easier onboarding
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:11.600]   process and people will migrate. The big head always winds up in the places where things are
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.080]   easier. So you'll have some very, very large instances of everything where they've made a
[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:20.480]   very easy onboarding process and they're charging something to offer tech support and some other
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:25.760]   limited features. Yeah. Here's, here's the, here's the many branches of the Fediverse that you were
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.280]   doing. That's a great term. That's the, yeah. Oh, that's beautiful. Thank you for finding that.
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:33.520]   And you have WordPress on there. So let me, so, so Tony Stumblebine, who's the now the CEO of
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:40.400]   Medium, he came on this last week and said, because they have a Medium.social. People said,
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:43.440]   Oh, what are you going to do? And he said, well, we're trying to figure this out. Yeah.
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:47.840]   That's the thing. So I said, what I would want is to be able to have an account,
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:56.400]   similarly, as some friendica or pixel fed, that my Medium account is on activity pub,
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.840]   but it posts maybe a sample of a post or something like that. That's a good idea. I can
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:05.760]   subscribe to people on media. What a great idea. What a great idea. And they do something new.
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.800]   I love them. So then I brought Kevin Marks into the discussion. Of course, Kevin went,
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:14.720]   100 things that you should do if you do Indie Web properly, but it's good to educate them. And
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:18.400]   so they're trying to figure this out. First, I just saw it has an instance of
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.240]   Tumblr is starting to see. Which is of course,
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:28.560]   automatic as well. Matt has always been a supporter of open source and and and the Fediverse.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:32.240]   Tumblr said they're going to be compared to the Fediverse. So a Tumblr account would be
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:38.800]   also an activity pub. And WordPress now has a very easy to use plugin. So you're, it's easy if
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:44.560]   you have a word plus blog to have it automatically post to the Fediverse. What is it post?
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.840]   What would I put a couple of?
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:48.800]   Choose. I mean, it's it's obviously not the whole thing. Well, I guess it could be the
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.400]   whole thing. I haven't looked at it. Some instances. Yeah. There's also this sort of
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:58.000]   validates, Manton Reese's philosophy. He started microblog. Yeah. I mean, that was years ago. He
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.600]   was like, people want something that's a blog that's a little like Twitter and it's not Twitter.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:05.840]   And this is a whole new thing. And now as the world, the Fediverse grows like, oh, well,
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:10.000]   microblog is already plugged into it. You can just like subscribe to people's microblog
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:15.360]   feeds on your mastodon client or whatever. And it's like, oh, this is neat. This is where
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.840]   you get different parts of these universes linking up. It was so great to watch Kevin at work
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:26.480]   upholding the standards of the indie web and say, this is how you should do this. This is how
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:30.800]   you should do that. And here's why. Manton has always been very active as well in the indie web.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.560]   Yeah. And I actually have a microblog account. I've had one ever since day one.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:42.640]   It was a Kickstarter, I think. But yeah, it's a great, I mean, it's a great idea.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:51.920]   You know, here's some bells I heard in Valencia, Spain. And you put the audio on, I said, you just,
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:57.920]   I said, well, maybe, maybe it's not working. But anyway, yeah, I think it's a, it's a really,
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:03.200]   it's a nice idea. Here I am interviewing Bill Atkinson. So I haven't used this a lot.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.680]   I do writer leaf is this right, this right that there's there's there's just some really simple,
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:13.280]   medium like, and I would, I would argue it's better to use those in something like post
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:21.920]   because post is owned by Andries and Horowitz, basically. And it's central. And I see a lot of
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:25.520]   journalists going there. And I think you're just repeating the same old as they're being.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:33.120]   Yeah, and I tried to convince no on on federating. And he might do it eventually, but not now.
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.680]   And he argued, you know, centralized, they don't want to that's against their, you know,
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:44.320]   their religion. Mike Masnick wrote a really good piece saying, if we learned nothing,
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:52.480]   this is and I think this one of the big lessons usual. I was on floss weekly this morning talking
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:56.960]   about some of the lessons open source has taught us in 2022. I know you were you were there.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:02.160]   Yes, sir. And I think there were two big news stories towards the end of the year, but one was
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:07.840]   the collapse of Twitter. The other is the collapse of last pass that have that there's a lesson
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:15.600]   here that centralized closed source proprietary solutions. Aren't guaranteed to to serve you,
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:22.960]   but open source distributed solutions will always serve you. And so I really think that there are
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:26.880]   or if they don't, you know, you know it and you will know what to do about it.
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.880]   Yeah. So I agree with Mike Masnick that, okay, let's learn the lesson of Twitter.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:35.200]   If the world would just listen to Mike, things would be a lot.
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:42.400]   Misty's got my vote for benign dictator. I totally agree. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.120]   Mr. Fleischman was talking about the onboarding process and they got me thinking about,
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:52.880]   you know, brands again. And I brought this up a couple of weeks ago, but let's look at someone
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:17:00.000]   like the San Francisco 49ers or look at Manchester United, you know, big brands, a gazillion people
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:05.360]   follow those folks quite passionately on all of the different social media platforms. And they
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:10.640]   decide, you know what, we're going to go to the Fediverse. All right. So how are we going to get
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:16.000]   those folks from these centralized platforms over to the Fediverse?
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:22.320]   What, what, what their strategy be to get people over there? I don't even know. I don't even know
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:28.320]   where to begin just to get my family to hop off. So when you're talking to brands, I will tell you
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:34.000]   the lesson that I learned, which is a related lesson. When you're a broadcaster, you think in
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.760]   terms of audience, and it's one to many and you want to build as many people as possible.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:43.520]   And certainly the 49ers want to do that and et cetera. And of course, that's a natural thing.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:50.160]   But I have found and Twit was the lesson here that community trumps audience. And the Niners
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:54.720]   could, and the Niners know this a little bit because of the faithful and the tailgate.
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:18:00.560]   But they could really double down on community. And, and I think in the long run,
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:07.200]   that serves any brand better because those people are brand loyal. They're, you know,
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:10.800]   and I think a lot of brands try to have it both ways. They, they go, we've got our,
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:16.080]   what do they call them? The P1, you know, brand lovers and we're going to support them and
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:20.720]   encourage them and send them swag and whatever. Maybe this isn't ticket holders. And then we're,
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:24.800]   we're going to also use the NFL and have a broad network audience. And maybe that's fine.
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:30.800]   But for instance, if, if I think the NFL probably shouldn't abandon Twitter or Facebook anywhere
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.280]   or 49ers, but they should certainly, it would be very interesting if they created a Mastodon
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:42.400]   for their super fans. They fans do that. The fans do that. They, you go to Reddit.
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:49.920]   Yeah. There's a 49ers subreddit. That is fantastic. That's true. It's full of memes and fun stuff.
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:54.880]   And I love it. Yeah. And I think there's a bunch of opportunities, right? One is just to have a
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:01.520]   presence and, and, and, and, and bring information and bring things to people. Two is to have a
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:07.040]   community, I mean, a customer service presence, right? I had problems with my files wasn't working.
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:12.480]   And I, and I couldn't get anybody to call. I go on Twitter, boom, boom, boom. New Year's Day.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:14.880]   Yeah. New Year's Day. Somebody comes, I said, I don't really do it. New Year's Day.
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.280]   I said, no, we're going to do it, right? So customer service.
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:25.520]   I should say, then I think a third is in certain cases, brands like Twit to do exactly what Leo's
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:31.440]   doing, which is to share the load of the Fediverse and create a home for all his fans,
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:39.680]   like Len Fleischman, is a great and generous thing to do and does, as you know, community manager,
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:44.880]   does more to bring the community together and, and gather around the fire. I think that's an
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:50.960]   opportunity for Twit. It's the whole deal. It's, and for any, I think independent podcaster,
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.920]   that should be the whole deal, obviously for the 49ers, it's not. But if your fans are,
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:20:01.840]   look at this is the 49ers subreddit. If you're fans, this is not the 49ers. If your fans are doing
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:11.040]   this, support them and give them a home. You know, why is Reddit owning this? Why aren't the 49ers
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:15.120]   owning this, you know? Right. Right. Set up an instance.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:21.840]   Set up an instance. That's the big opportunity. With, with, with some actual plan, you know,
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:26.320]   and not just saying, all right, we're, we're on the Fediverse. Here it is, but, you know,
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:30.320]   actually have some type of execution plan to make it a community. And I wonder who will be the first
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:36.720]   to do that. By the way, one of the great victories of the 49ers subreddit is this young woman,
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:43.440]   who's I think she's in Europe, who when, when Jimmy Garoppolo, who was our quarterback last year,
[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:48.080]   the rumors where he was going to be traded. And she started doing a drawing of Jimmy G every
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:54.000]   day until he gets traded. He wasn't traded. He became her starting quarterback. And then got
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:59.680]   injured day 336 every single day. She's been putting up a new drawing.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:05.840]   That's not the Niners. That's what community does. That's community. Yes.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:13.360]   That's fantastic. And then you see people like George Lucas trying to shut that stuff down.
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:18.560]   And you just go, you don't get it. You just don't get it. George's, I think, changed his tune,
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:24.000]   but he used to be horrific lead litigious. And all he does on the copyrights anymore, right?
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.160]   So it's Disney. Disney is Disney is a Disney is an interesting, yeah, different relationship.
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:32.800]   I think I understand community, don't I? Yeah. Paramount too. Like Paramount and Star Trek was
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:38.560]   always a there are a lot of like those fan shot Star Trek sequels. And as long as money wasn't
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:42.880]   exchanging hands. Paramount. It's really sweet. It's good for you.
[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:49.360]   One last Twitter story. One of the last remaining executives from pre-Eelon Twitter
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:56.560]   has left the building yesterday. According to platformers, always Shiffer, they really got the
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:02.960]   stuff. Ben Nam Reze, who is Twitter's head of product and engineering worked there since 2017
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:08.320]   has walked out the door. So there is now. Yeah, I could head of HR just walked out too.
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:14.080]   According to Zoe, there and platformer, there is now no longer anybody in power there who used to
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:20.320]   work for anybody. But Elon has what his goal was obviously from day one, is to surround himself
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.880]   with a fan. Do you remember when the Trump folks moved to the White House, they were so
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:30.160]   contemptuous of doing any transition stuff with going Obama people, they couldn't figure out how
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:35.120]   to turn the lights on in the room in which the cabinet meets. That's kind of where the
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:39.920]   busk is like, I just tore out a bunch of servers from this room. I'm going to
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:45.520]   take an axe to some servers in New Zealand or whatever. How do we flush the toilets in this
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:50.560]   place? That's right. Katie Markov. Carl Jenner who was a 10-year Twitter employee in the acting
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:55.440]   head of human resources. And this is one of the reasons, this is Casey Newton's tweet,
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:59.040]   this is one of the reasons it's going to be hard to figure out who gets paid when.
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:06.960]   Maybe they're not paying the rent only because no one knows how to write that check. It's
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:12.560]   completely possible. Completely possible. I wouldn't want to be in HR at Twitter right now,
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:19.440]   so I don't blame Katie Markov for leaving. All right, that's enough of that. But I guess we
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:27.040]   kind of still have to cover it a little bit. But it's news. At this point, my attitude is,
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:34.240]   it's a lost cause. What are you going to do? Have fun over there. But you still use an amp to
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:41.760]   create a fact, I think. I will still continue to use it. But even, like I said, a few minutes ago,
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:47.520]   right now, I'm just sort of an autopilot just with social media in general. That's regardless of
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:55.280]   it being Twitter. I'm just sick of some of the... It's not a pleasant mental stuff
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:00.160]   that you have to battle with over there. It was funny because Taylor Lawrence,
[02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:05.520]   and you probably saw this, Jeff, came over to Mastodon and said, "Well,
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:08.080]   journalists are never going to use this if you don't have quote tweets."
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:16.720]   Another feature which actually Mastodon does have. I responded, "Okay, see you."
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:23.360]   Because my attitude is, you don't come in here and say, "Well, hey, if you don't have this,
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.920]   I'm leaving." And then she did leave. All right, but let me just make it... I'll
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:30.640]   argue it back because I've been in the middle of these discussions and I'm going to have an event
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:39.920]   coming up on Black Twitter. I saw what's his name? Oh hell, the Adam Curry.
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:45.600]   Spoke to one of those people. Who's who runs an instance? He has no agenda for this.
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:51.600]   I know it is. I saw him live. Go after Dr. Jonathan Flowers, who's one of the experts on Black
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:25:01.920]   Twitter. The discussion about quote tweets is not just the affordance itself. The discussion is also
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:10.960]   about the reception that people have received from certain obnoxious white boy geeks on Mastodon.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:17.680]   That's a lot of the issue. Is it both sides? Yes, there's things to respect
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.640]   and how Mastodon did it, but there's also things to respect in a community coming and saying,
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:27.840]   "Are you going to value the perspective that we bring?" That's not how she came in.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:30.800]   And if you don't, she came in and said, "I'm not talking about that." I'm not talking about that.
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:35.440]   I don't know what's so totally if you don't do this. And that's exactly the wrong way to do it.
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:38.560]   And by the way, what I realized, and we, I got in a conversation with her,
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:45.040]   what I realized is she came with a Twitter mindset that what you do on the social network is stir
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:50.800]   the pot, and she was happy to stir the outrage. And that's exactly what we can do.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:55.520]   What happened instead, though, there was a really good substantive discussion about the pluses and
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:01.920]   minuses. By the way, Oigens said again today that he has changed his mind, consider yesterday,
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:07.440]   considerably from 2018. And he says, "We are now discussing some version of quote tweets."
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:10.640]   Yeah, I don't think that's the way it happens. Yeah, I think we said it before. You can turn,
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.720]   one way or the other. I mean, people should have the ability to, like, there's one of the debates.
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:18.800]   I'll say my strategy, by the way, was when this rage was like one of the second, I think
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:23.360]   John Mastodon was the first thing that filled my timeline. It was like, it was funny for five
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:27.440]   minutes, goodbye. And then the quote tweet thing happened, I was like, "Oh, I have a strategy because
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:31.440]   there's a lot of good, easy granularity. I'm Mastodon." I just muted anybody who brought up
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:35.040]   quote tweets. I just muted them for three days. And I waited for the fever to pass.
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.480]   Once it had burned out, then people were having slower and better conversations about it, and I
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:47.200]   could follow them. Yeah. I mean, Twitter must have done your really much more in control.
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:52.960]   Because it is small, every instance is smaller. It never gets overpowering. But I don't think
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:58.000]   that there's an argument about, "Oh, we want to take over for Twitter," or "We need to have this
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.280]   feature or that feature." That's not necessary. They're just little communities. And I love our
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:08.400]   little Twitter dot social community. But there was a really interesting discussion about search.
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:18.160]   And the quote tweets in search of the two things that the originators of Mastodon decided not to
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:22.080]   have because it wouldn't leave to bad means. Hey, search is technically difficult. There's
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:25.360]   actually a good reason-- That's the other issue. That search is not there. Especially in a federated
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:32.400]   world. Yeah. And so search, you can as a Mastodon owner, and I do turn on Elasticsearch,
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:39.600]   which allows you to search within our Twitch social instance. And within your own Twitch stuff.
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:45.520]   And so that, I think, is adequate to search the entire Fediverse would be very, very costly.
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:51.040]   Most of the Fediverse does not exist on my server. The only part of the Fediverse that exists is
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:56.880]   things people on my server have subscribed to. So yeah, you could search that. By the way,
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:01.680]   that is a problem with decentralization. For instance, people can reply to me, and I don't see
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:07.840]   the reply if no one on my server follows them. So there are absolutely not what's happening.
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:14.560]   There are large technical issues, but if you think about it, it's like email. I only have on Twitch.social
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:19.200]   stuff that people have fetched. I'm not going out and fetching the entire Fediverse
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:25.040]   because it's too big. It's too costly. So we only have stuff people have followed. So yes,
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:30.800]   if somebody on another server that no one follows responds to you, you're not going to see it.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.320]   Unless you follow them or somebody else follows them. Since you always answer my Fediverse
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.280]   question so brilliantly, I am not an ex-Twitter started. I'll give you my best answer.
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:43.840]   But you know, hell, a lot more than I do. Twitter started without search and had to buy it and did.
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:48.960]   But even so, the search was never great. And I often used Google to search Twitter.
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:54.080]   Now, for all the architectural reasons you've just gone through, this would not be easy. But if
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:29:00.480]   Google was Google, could Google decide cultural issues, decide protests, decide? Could there be a
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:06.800]   way in which they could scrape all of their own? They are. They are. They are. In your server settings,
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:16.560]   as somebody who has a massive uninstanced, you can allow it to be searched or not.
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:21.600]   So we know Google does it. And so yes, so it's I'm trying to find where it is. Unfortunately,
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:26.960]   sometimes it's a little hard to figure out. But there is a there is a ability to say,
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:31.840]   no, don't make this here it is. Allow unauthenticated access to public timelines.
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:33.760]   So that's what that means.
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:39.440]   Logged out visitors are able to browse the most recent public unless that's turned on. Google can't
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:45.040]   spider you. Okay. And then I think there are other other settings as I remember there are other
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:50.320]   settings that you can turn on. Well, that's also what comes up on your just your your home page for
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:55.440]   unsigned and people. Yeah, if you're not logged in, normally you would see that. But some sites say,
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:30:00.800]   I don't I don't want people to come looking for content. So we're not going to make that available.
[02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:05.280]   That's I mean, this look, everybody who and Glenn, you started to refer to some sites
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:13.520]   left 5000 word posts. We don't because that's insane. That's a blog. That's a media message.
[02:30:13.520 --> 02:30:21.040]   There's an argument for that. You know, you you can do anything you want with this. It's open
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:26.320]   source. You can change it any way you want. I think the quote tweet thing, you know, given that I
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:30.880]   muted everybody, I should have no opinion on this. But it was it was I think something that's
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:36.000]   emerged is talking about again, mastodon control or fediverse and control is that if there were
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:41.120]   an option that people could either I don't either opt in or opt out, maybe on an instance basis in
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:45.920]   terms of which is the default from allowing yourself to be quoted. That helps, you know,
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:52.480]   mastodon has more and better visibility parameters than Twitter ever had in terms of when you post
[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:57.760]   an item, how it gets, you know, indexed or shown to other people. And I think Twitter, you know,
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:02.560]   has adopted some of those before it imploded. But I think the idea that you could say,
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:07.040]   I don't want this post or I don't want my account to be quoted. If you feel it's contributing to
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:12.560]   abuse, that's right. And there's also a debate probably do something like that, which would be
[02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:16.480]   great. Then you get an entire instance could be like, we are not an old quotes here quote to
[02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:20.960]   eat here, you're gonna have to do it as your or an individual post. Right. I love it. I love it.
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:25.600]   Why not? And then it becomes the same. Yeah. So if you want to be part of a broader discussion,
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:29.920]   your reporter, your news outlet, you're somebody who's a public intellectual, like Jeff Jarvis,
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:34.080]   the Craig Newmark, Prince of an Opera, something about that, I can't hold the whole thing.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.600]   Then you can, you know, post things and you want that to be repeated.
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:44.400]   So Jeff, to show you that you can, in fact, use Google to search an instance, I entered in Google
[02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:52.160]   site colon twit dot social and Rust. And here's a lot of posts about Rust never sleeps. You could
[02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:59.840]   only do it instance, by instance. Well, you certainly can do that. It means that it's in the index.
[02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:06.560]   So I don't know how highly Randy Waidell's post on Rust. Well, I guess what'll happen is,
[02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:10.400]   will you search for Randy Waidell for any purpose?
[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:16.080]   Yeah. Will it be a mask done item? Yes. Good. There you go. I haven't seen yet, but it's small.
[02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:22.080]   Yeah. It's being indexed, I guess is the point. And so whatever happens to stuff that Google's
[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:29.840]   index is, let me see if I search Google, if I search for chief twit, I'm going to find Elon,
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:37.200]   unfortunately. No, no, there it goes. It shows my Twitter account. It shows writers talking about
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:42.800]   Elon's chief twit. Which are button sir. I got it here. So so jr. dot host,
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:48.240]   John Ligoum is quoting me a mask done and it came up with the first screen load.
[02:32:48.240 --> 02:32:53.920]   So yeah, Google searching. Yeah. So that's good news. Yeah, I think so. It'll cause some people to
[02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:59.520]   scream bloody murder, but I think it's good news. You can turn it off. That's the good news.
[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:04.240]   Wow. There's actually a lot here as a master administrator, you just turn it off. And then
[02:33:04.240 --> 02:33:10.240]   Google search after I was master done. By the way, that's true for any site. You just put a no robots.
[02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:17.200]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No robots allowed. Yeah. Hacky Derm. I think this is the beauty of
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:22.000]   decentralization. You get to do what you want. You get to, and if I decide, I don't like quote
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.560]   tweets because it's really heating up the conversation onto it that social. I'll turn it off. And then
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:32.960]   I don't like you for doing that. I'll leave your server and you go. Yes. Yeah. That seems like
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:38.800]   the right way to do things. That's the way it used to be before a few big companies dominated
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:43.600]   this stuff. So we all must did us all a favor. Absolutely. Bring us back.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:50.320]   Maybe that's his plan. I think he's Jack's plan. Give him kudos for that.
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:58.160]   No, no, between the two of you, Leo, give it a sympathy and you give it a respect. No, no, no.
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:06.960]   I think we should just stop this show right now. Goodbye. It's over. No. All right. I'll let you do
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:13.440]   pics of the week and then and then the hammer will fall. Hey, everybody. Leo LaPorte here. I am the
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:19.120]   founder and one of the hosts at the Twit podcast network. I want to talk to you a little bit about
[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:24.560]   what we do here at Twit because I think it's unique. And I think for anybody who is
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:33.280]   bringing a product or a service to a tech audience, you need to know about what we do here at Twit.
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:40.480]   We've built an amazing audience of engaged, intelligent, affluent listeners who listen to us
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:46.080]   and trust us when we recommend a product. Our mission statement is Twit is to build a highly
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:51.440]   engaged community of tech enthusiasts. Already, you should be your ears should be
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:56.720]   perking up at that because highly engaged is good for you. Tech enthusiasts, if that's who
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.840]   you're looking for, this is the place. We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.880]   and use technology in today's world. And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:13.440]   knowledge comes from our advertisers. We are very careful. We pick advertisers with great products,
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:19.360]   great services with integrity, and introduce them to our audience with authenticity
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:26.720]   and genuine enthusiasm. And that makes our host red ads different from anything else you can buy.
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:34.880]   We are literally bringing you to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement.
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:40.080]   We like to create partnerships with trusted brands. Brands who are in it for the long run,
[02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:46.160]   long-term partners that want to grow with us. And we have so many great success stories.
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:52.880]   Tim Broome, who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one has been with us
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:59.120]   ever since. He said, quote, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit network."
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.640]   I think the proof is in the pudding. Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible that have been with us
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:11.200]   for more than 10 years. They stick around because their ads work. And honestly, isn't that why you're
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:16.800]   buying advertising? You get a lot with Twit. We have a very full service attitude. We almost
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:24.560]   think of it as artisanal advertising, boutique advertising. You'll get a full service continuity
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:30.080]   team. People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support you with
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:37.360]   everything from copywriting to graphic design. So you are not alone in this. We embed our ads
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:43.040]   into the shows. They're not added later. They're part of the shows. In fact, often,
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:47.360]   they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying,
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:52.880]   "Yeah, I love that." Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that."
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:58.880]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts,
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:05.120]   saying, "Yeah, that sounds great." We deliver, always over-deliver on impressions. So you know
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:10.960]   you're going to get the impressions you expect. The ads are unique every time. We don't pre-record
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:16.240]   them and roll them in. We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show. We'll give you
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:22.480]   great onboarding services. Adtech with pod sites that's free for direct clients gives you a lot of
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:26.880]   reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working. You'll get courtesy commercials.
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:31.840]   You actually can take our ads and share them across social media and landing pages. That really
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:36.720]   extends the reach. There are other free goodies too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:43.120]   that sent to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff. We give you bonus ads
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:49.280]   and social media promotion too. So if you want to be a long-term partner, introduce your product to
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:57.920]   a savvy, engaged tech audience. Visit twit.tv/advertise. Check out those testimonials. Mark McCrary is the

[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:10.080]   We've been with him for 16 years. Mark said the feedback from many advertisers over 16 years
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:17.280]   across a range of product categories. Everything from razors to computers is that if ads and podcasts
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.560]   are going to work for a brand, they're going to work on Twitch shows. I'm very proud of what we do
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:29.440]   because it's honest. It's got integrity. It's authentic. And it really is a great introduction

[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:47.200]   partners that we've personally and thoroughly vetted. I have absolute approval on everybody.

[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:18.320]   Do you have Mr. Glenn Fleischman, star of stage screen and typewriters?
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:24.080]   A pick of the week for us? I did and then I've forgotten what it was.
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:29.920]   Well, that was five hours ago. I don't blame you. I come back to me and I'll get it.
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:37.760]   Okay, Mr. What's his name? Jeff Jarvis? Do you have a number? We used one of them already.
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:40.480]   I did. I've got all sorts of services. I've got all sorts of services.
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.640]   I've got all sorts of services. People make fun of the other show.
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:46.800]   For not liking bridges. For being scared or bridging. Oh, I don't make fun of you.
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.800]   That's sad. The Golden Gate Bridge is in and I quote, "fair condition."
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.720]   Fair condition. If you were in the hospital and fair condition,
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:03.600]   you wouldn't walk over somebody because they kind of, no, the Golden Gate Bridge is in
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:09.520]   fair condition. I'm not insane people. But good news, the infrastructure bill
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:14.560]   has allocated $400 million. Tell me what it's done to retro nothing yet.
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:19.440]   Still in fair condition. But apparently, now actually, this should scare you.
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:22.080]   It has not been retrofitted for earthquake protection.
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:26.720]   Yeah. I think you don't want to be on the bridge if there's an earthquake.
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.240]   Go ahead and three, four, five, the 89 quake. Just fine.
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:32.160]   The Bay Bridge, I have to say, did not.
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:36.000]   Well, did not. I will not drive over that. Never get, never get.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.720]   Famously. I nearly had a heart attack just driving across.
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:42.080]   My also, in all this Glenn's presence here, I wanted to mention, oh,
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:47.760]   I didn't realize how much Google Fonts had grown. I followed somebody on Mastodon who's
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.680]   works on Google Fonts. Oh, my Lord. What a resource that is.
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:53.680]   Oh, wow. It's great.
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:56.640]   They now coordinate a lot of open source fonts. They're great fonts.
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:02.240]   It does slow a site down if you use Google Fonts on your site because they have to load from Google,
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:07.760]   which I'm not crazy about. You can load them with cash.
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:14.560]   You can download them. I think all the fonts, they list are free and ready.
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:18.560]   So you can put them on your own server and link them locally if you want.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:26.960]   1,174 open source font families with APIs for convenient use via CSS and Android.
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:31.760]   Yeah, I've used Google Fonts in the past and I really think they're great.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:33.200]   I didn't know how much it had grown.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:36.240]   I think Google has to think about this as an Adobe subscriber.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:37.840]   So I have all of your fonts.
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:38.720]   It's amazing.
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:40.720]   Wow, this is nice.
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:44.080]   Google has also spent, well, I don't, they have not released the amount of money,
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:47.760]   but it is clearly tens of millions of dollars over the last, I think we're up to like,
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:50.800]   nine years with their no-toe font project, N-O-T-O.
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:51.760]   Oh, obviously that's right.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:55.040]   No, not Tofu because you got the little, right.
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:58.720]   Yeah, there's a little rectangular box you sometimes get and people call it Tofu
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:00.080]   if there's not a character for it.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:01.600]   So not Tofu, no-toe.
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:08.480]   And they've been producing glyphs for every language in the world represented in
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:13.680]   Unicode, little by little, and in a uniform character design across all the sets.
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:16.880]   And they said, "Monotype and Adobe and independent font factories."
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:19.440]   And I interviewed the people involved years ago and they were like,
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:26.000]   "Well, we found Tibetan monks to talk to them about how you turn this calligraphic writing
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.640]   into something that would be representative to Tibetan readers,
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:33.600]   because there was no consistent single version of Tibetan in like a font way.
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:34.640]   It was always written.
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:36.720]   And anyway, very interesting stuff.
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:37.760]   And that's all for you too.
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.120]   I will tie and I want to get a shout out with my pick in the week.
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:42.560]   Real quickly, I'll throw this in.
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.560]   You know his name, Eric Speicerman, right, Glenn?
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:47.840]   Yeah.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:48.480]   Oh, yes.
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:51.360]   One of the great, 70 just turned 75.
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:55.440]   He wrote one of the great books on fonts was anybody who's interested in typefaces
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:42:59.040]   should read just at least for the baseline knowledge.
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:04.160]   And he's teamed up with Google Design to give away, and by the way, I've bought
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:06.560]   four, two or three copies anyway of this book.
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:08.320]   I give it to people all the time.
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:12.880]   Stop stealing sheep and find out how type works.
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.880]   So you can go and download this.
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:19.680]   And I mean, you should buy the book because it's a book and it's a nice book.
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:25.360]   But if you're interested without spending any money on learning about fonts and typefaces,
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:27.280]   this is fantastic.
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:31.840]   And I know you you agree, Glenn, and this thank you Google Google Design, Google fonts
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:33.280]   for making it available.
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:34.400]   Yeah, I really didn't.
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.960]   I missed, I was going to get together with Eric in Berlin, where he has a letter press studio called
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:42.960]   P98A, of course, for reasons.
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:44.000]   I think that's the address.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000]   It's at puts down her plots or something.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.360]   And but he's out of the country.
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:48.080]   He was out of Germany.
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:50.080]   So I did not see his shop on this trip.
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.160]   Yeah, they actually I was going to say that Glenn has been giving me very kind advice on
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:55.760]   on the topography for my book.
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:56.320]   Oh, good.
[02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:57.280]   It's being a Gutenberg book.
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:43:58.080]   I care about this.
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:43:59.600]   So I've just selected.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:04.240]   I'm going to have the dubs font for the headings, which is a magnificent story we talked about before.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:09.120]   And Saven or Sébond, I don't know how you're supposed to say it, Glenn, for the body type.
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:12.400]   But I've also wanted drop initials and other things.
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:13.600]   So I was asking Glenn, where do I go?
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:14.080]   Where do I go?
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:16.320]   And I got all kinds of great advice from folks online.
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:18.640]   And I got two choices for the publisher now.
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:24.000]   And they'll let me do this, which is really kind of cool to have a voice in the font choices.
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.960]   And at the end of the book, I'm going to have a colophon describing all that.
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:28.160]   Yay.
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:30.000]   If you want.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.840]   I don't know that people I'm asking, I'm going to add any opinions about typefaces or splashes.
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:35.040]   You're a palatable.
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:36.800]   That seems impossible to me.
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:38.320]   If you go to design.
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:39.760]   Design.google.
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:41.840]   There's a link right there on the front page.
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:45.600]   An interview with Eric Speakerman in a link to Google Fonts.
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:49.760]   Very generous donation of Fonts.
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:53.040]   I've read his book, All About Fonts.
[02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:58.240]   And so you agree it's a good way to get started, at least in fonts.
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:59.600]   Yeah.
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:00.800]   Creative Commons license.
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:01.520]   Which is great.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:03.440]   You can give it to your friends without guilt.
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:05.760]   So good.
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:06.560]   We I don't know.
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:07.680]   I'll give you that pick.
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:09.280]   Glenn, if you want to use that for yours.
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:10.240]   I remember.
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.200]   I remember my other guy.
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:12.800]   Take it first and I'll come.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:13.280]   Okay.
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:15.280]   Did you Jeff, are you done with your pick?
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:15.760]   I'm done.
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:16.080]   Okay.
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:17.920]   Why don't you go on if you want me to?
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:18.720]   No, stop.
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:21.360]   Just don't go on the Google Golden Gate Bridge.
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.120]   It's not upgraded yet.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:26.800]   But when it is, I hope you'll come up and see us because you do need to go over the Golden Gate Bridge
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:27.680]   to come visit to it.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:30.240]   I think they're you could do the Bay Bridge, but you won't do that.
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:32.240]   You could go.
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:32.880]   Oh, you could take the ferry.
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:33.680]   The ferry to Sarsalito.
[02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:34.240]   There you go.
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:36.480]   Those almost never sink.
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:37.440]   So I think you're all right.
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:38.480]   Almost never.
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:40.960]   Actually, this best guy's getting flooded right now.
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:41.120]   Yeah.
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:41.680]   Yeah.
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:42.160]   Yeah.
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:46.080]   The best place to be in an earthquake would be on a ferry, I would think.
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.200]   Unless there's a tsunami.
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:48.560]   This is a tidal wave.
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:53.600]   The best place to be is in New Jersey.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:54.560]   New Jersey.
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.120]   Edminster.
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:57.600]   Ant, your pick of the week.
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:04.160]   I had one in there, but we were already discussing it was the whole tick tock at half time.
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:11.120]   But my actual pick this time will be to watch coach Prime's docu-series on Amazon.
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:13.360]   If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber.
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:18.560]   I know you folks don't care about sports, but Deon Sanders, love him.
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:21.120]   I hate him is a fascinating man.
[02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:24.400]   So he's coach Prime is Deon Sanders?
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.120]   That is correct.
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:26.960]   Oh, Deon Deon.
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:27.760]   All right.
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:32.960]   His story, you know, being a sports fan and following him since I was a, you know,
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:33.280]   a tee.
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:33.760]   Yeah.
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:36.640]   I've always loved watching him play and watching his story.
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:43.360]   And what he has done at Jackson State University, historically Black College in university.
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:49.520]   And now what he's attempting to do at the, at Colorado University in Boulder.
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:50.640]   I know you.
[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:52.080]   Oh, that's my son went in there.
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:52.080]   Yeah.
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:52.720]   That's right.
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:53.360]   The buffs.
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:47:01.440]   It's such a, it's such a fascinating story. And I hate that he has gotten just as much hate
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:02.640]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:04.880]   vitriol as he's gotten to accolades.
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:05.280]   Why?
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:06.880]   Especially from the Black community.
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:13.760]   Because a lot of, a lot of folks are saying he quote sold out by leaving Jackson State.
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:14.320]   Huh.
[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:15.120]   To take the job.
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:16.480]   Oh, Colorado.
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.640]   When this dude had a gazillion dollars already, he's not there for the paycheck.
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:20.800]   Yeah.
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:22.880]   I was going to say going to Jackson State is,
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:28.880]   you know, he could probably work in the front office of any football NFL team is a big deal.
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.080]   That's a great donation.
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:30.880]   That's a contribution.
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:31.200]   Right.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:31.600]   Yeah.
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:37.840]   He, he did a lot for that university and the, the, the athletic programs there as well.
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:40.800]   There's a lot for the HBCU's and the conference there.
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:45.520]   Just put a lot more positive attention on those schools.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.520]   Hopefully they'll be able to get more money and, and, and make things better with the
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:51.360]   facilities and so forth.
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:58.480]   And the next challenge was to go to a power five school and try to build a one in football team
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:47:59.200]   there.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.640]   That's not selling out.
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:05.520]   That's just someone that's taken another challenge as well as taking an opportunity to help
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:11.360]   enrich some young men and women's lives in the, in the world of football.
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:16.800]   You know, my son and I, we've been watching this journey and he and I have talked about it.
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:20.480]   And I've told her straight up, I said, man, if you ever get the opportunity
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:25.120]   to learn from someone like Deon Sanders, I'm all for it.
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:29.200]   You know, so why would I hate on him and seeing what he's done in his past?
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:35.280]   Yeah, he's got some, some funny crazy stories, but from a success standpoint,
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:37.920]   everywhere he's been, it's been a success.
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:43.520]   It seems appropriate that prime time should be on Amazon prime, Amazon prime, you know,
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:52.000]   he had ESPN showing up at Jackson State University to do their college game days
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.440]   on Saturday morning.
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:54.960]   That's a big freaking deal.
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:55.280]   Yeah.
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:57.680]   And he said he's like, yeah, I'm not here for Jackson State.
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:58.480]   Do you hear?
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:02.320]   Because I'm here and I asked you to come here because I need you to see this.
[02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:02.640]   Good.
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:04.160]   It's, I get it.
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:08.720]   And also a top 10 view on Amazon prime.
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:10.560]   So you're not alone in watching it.
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:11.760]   I can't wait to watch it.
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:15.440]   Well, you know, he was a niner and Lisa probably as soon as I say this,
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:16.560]   we'll be watching it tonight.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:19.280]   So that's good.
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:20.080]   Thank you for sharing that.
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:20.800]   I didn't know about it.
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:21.600]   That's great.
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:22.160]   That's great.
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:24.880]   And lastly, it's the beginning of the year.
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.080]   So it should be mentioned, you know, I know a lot of you've
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:30.320]   Twitter listeners check out Wikipedia.
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:32.080]   Make sure you donate.
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:32.880]   Give them two bucks.
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:33.520]   Hell yeah.
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:34.160]   That's a box.
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:34.720]   Something.
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.720]   So go ahead and donate to Wikipedia.
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:44.960]   Single best example of what decentralization and community can do is Wikipedia.
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:47.520]   I mean, one of the best things on the internet is fantastic.
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:51.840]   And I donate every month because we use it so much.
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:52.560]   Yeah.
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.040]   I feel like I'd be, it'd be awful of me not to give them a little something every month.
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:57.840]   Yeah.
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:58.800]   Good advice.
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:49:59.840]   Wikipedia.
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:05.040]   They don't have, they don't have the handout this month.
[02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:06.000]   They did last month.
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.080]   So, but you can still donate and I just go to somewhere.
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:10.880]   Just go to a contract.
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:11.680]   You don't need a something.
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:11.840]   Yeah.
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:12.000]   Yeah.
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:12.480]   Yeah.
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:13.840]   You know, that's user contributions.
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:14.240]   I don't know.
[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:16.480]   Is such a great site.
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:17.440]   Oh, I love it.
[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:21.680]   In fact, a good place to go for news, by the way, if you go to the front page.
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.640]   Believe it or not, they do an excellent job covering the news.
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.320]   Do you remember now?
[02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:32.240]   I remember.
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:32.720]   Where are you?
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:33.200]   It's a great story.
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.360]   Are you now or were you ever a member?
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:37.680]   Of the Communist Party?
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:39.360]   It was, it was.
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:43.680]   The answer is, I refuse to answer on the grounds that may incriminate me.
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:46.160]   Have you no shame, Mr. Fleischman?
[02:50:46.160 --> 02:50:46.640]   Okay, sorry.
[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:53.200]   Representative elect as all, as we record this, representatives, the House of Representative
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:58.320]   are elect because they have not yet been sworn in because, as we record, there's only six votes
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.560]   have been taken for the speaker's chair.
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:05.520]   It may be a hundred by the time you, if you're not watching live by the time this goes out.
[02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:09.200]   So, Robert Garcia, a very lovely person, it sounds like.
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:11.200]   Sorry, went around a couple of days ago.
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:12.160]   He was going to be sworn in.
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:14.800]   There's sort of a stack of things that people would be sworn in on,
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:16.080]   Bibles, family Bibles.
[02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:18.720]   I might be a Quran in there that has been in years past.
[02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:19.360]   Other things.
[02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:23.600]   Superman issue number one, not action comics, but Superman.
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:25.440]   And people were like, "Oh, who is there?"
[02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:26.080]   "Baba, baba."
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:28.240]   And I was like, "Oh, that seems, that seems a little trivial."
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:30.400]   And then you're like, "Oh, it was borrowed from the Library of Congress,
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:34.000]   which Congress people have direct access to borrow things."
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.200]   Oh, that sounds whatever.
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:36.480]   Then the whole story comes out.
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:38.960]   And it's, oh my God, it's a lovely, lovely story.
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:41.280]   He's a Democrat out of California.
[02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:43.280]   He was mayor of Long Beach.
[02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:46.720]   And both his parents, his father or his stepfather and his mother,
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:50.400]   died due to COVID early in the COVID pandemic.
[02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:51.520]   And so he's being sworn in.
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:53.680]   He's a gay man.
[02:51:53.680 --> 02:51:55.920]   He's married gay man, not to be mistaken,
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:51:59.440]   with another married gay man who was made up some of his history about being an immigrant.
[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:02.000]   And so forth, George.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:03.680]   So, as this guy is, Robert Garcia.
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.720]   Don't get confused.
[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:08.320]   He's an immigrant from Peru when he was five years old.
[02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:12.240]   And so he is swearing in on supermanish number one,
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:15.520]   because it was so important to him to see someone as a child,
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:18.400]   who was an immigrant with a sense of justice, who had a secret identity.
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:23.200]   He thought it was because he was gay and he wasn't out when he was a kid, right?
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:28.400]   And he's his citizenship certificate and a picture of his mother and stepfather.
[02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:31.280]   He is like, "Oh, okay, this is a beautiful story."
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:36.880]   It is traditional for the Library of Congress to loan out articles to be sworn in on.
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:42.080]   Usually they figure it's going to be a Bible or a Koran, but they lent out the superman.
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:45.600]   And as we should point out, in Article 4 of the US Constitution says,
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:50.320]   "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:53.840]   to any office or public trust under the United States."
[02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:54.720]   Thank you very much.
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:59.840]   Although, good luck getting elected president, if you don't have, at least professably.
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:02.240]   You're not six feet tall.
[02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:02.800]   Yeah.
[02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:04.000]   You don't have a religion.
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.440]   So this is not the super famous one.
[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:08.400]   I once, when I was a kid, I saw action comics number one,
[02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:11.920]   because the comic book store owner in my hometown of Eugene, Oregon,
[02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:15.840]   had just bought it for some crazy amount of money in the 80s.
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:19.280]   And I went into the store and he was standing there and some of the people around,
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:20.240]   and they were like, "Can we look at it?"
[02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:20.880]   He's like, "Sure."
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:22.800]   He pulls out a briefcase, silver bouquets.
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:23.360]   Oh my God.
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:24.720]   Click, click, click, opens it up.
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:26.640]   Doesn't let us touch it, obviously.
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:27.200]   Wow.
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:28.400]   But we're like, "Oh, there it is."
[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:28.960]   Okay.
[02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:31.920]   So this is Superman number one, which came out apparently a year later,
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:35.200]   and is only worth action comics worth millions of dollars,
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:37.200]   and this is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:40.160]   So it's not quite as valuable, but also very rare,
[02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:42.160]   and the lightful part of America.
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:47.040]   And to remind people that Superman was invented by two Jewish kids from New York,
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:49.840]   who had much of their credit and money stolen from them.
[02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:53.920]   But after a multi-decade rights and copyright and other battle,
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:56.080]   there are states finally got some justice.
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:53:59.040]   Joe Schuster and Jay Segal.
[02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:00.080]   And Segal.
[02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:02.240]   Yeah, Segal and Jewish kids.
[02:54:02.240 --> 02:54:03.040]   Couple of Jewish kids.
[02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:05.120]   That's where Michael Chabon wrote.
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:06.160]   There's a book called--
[02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:07.200]   Oh, I love that book.
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:08.400]   Cavalier and Clay, right?
[02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:11.520]   That's a little bit of a take off of that story.
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.200]   I love Chabon.
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:17.520]   Well, I hope Representative Cartista Garcia got to touch it
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:18.880]   as he got sworn in on it.
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:19.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:20.320]   But I also--
[02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:20.960]   Isn't this warning yet?
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:24.000]   He really wears white gloves or at least wash his hands and--
[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:26.720]   So, nobody's over the surface.
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:29.840]   Leo, by the time you record what is this episode, 697,
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:31.600]   maybe the episode 800 or 900.
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:36.400]   You mean they can't swear in a new Congress until they figure out who the speaker is?
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.000]   They can't get paid and you can't do anything.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.640]   Nobody is technically in the house at the moment.
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:41.680]   The Senate works differently.
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:43.760]   You have to have a speaker, first order of business.
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:46.480]   They cannot do anything else until it's resolved.
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:47.280]   Oh, my God.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:50.560]   Oh, my God.
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:53.680]   They're voting to adjourn right now as we close the show.
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:55.280]   They're not doing the 6 votes.
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:57.600]   We're going to adjourn after the House adjourns.
[02:54:57.600 --> 02:54:58.560]   Well, that's right.
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:54:59.120]   That's right.
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:00.560]   Somebody am messing that up.
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:02.560]   Somebody am messing that up.
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:03.760]   I think the--
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:10.320]   Orville Redbacher stock should grow up as people buy more popcorn to watch this happen
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:11.840]   and roll in the Senate.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:12.400]   Wow.
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.720]   I've got a big vat of shodding for it in my basement.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:16.560]   It just keeps getting more and more full.
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:20.160]   Do you want to load a little bit of research or some use of humor there on the run down to close it out?
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:20.880]   Oh, sure.
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:21.360]   Why not?
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:23.200]   Oh, why 90s?
[02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:24.560]   Is he your member of Congress?
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:25.200]   No.
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:26.240]   No, it's not.
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:26.720]   It's Long Island.
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:27.760]   Long Island.
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:28.320]   Yeah.
[02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:28.800]   Long Island.
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:30.000]   Which nobody says, by the way, but--
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:30.480]   Why?
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:30.960]   No.
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:32.160]   Nobody says Long Island?
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:33.360]   No.
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:34.560]   I grew up saying Long Island.
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:35.360]   I say--
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.720]   I grew up there.
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:37.680]   Oh, for the first time.
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:39.200]   They say New Haven, though.
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:40.320]   So there you go.
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:42.960]   Oh, by myself.
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:48.560]   Here, there were pictures of him yesterday sitting in the house because nobody wanted to
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:52.800]   come next to a stand next to him for fear that they would somehow be associated
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:58.160]   with this guy who apparently lied about everything and is, in fact, wanted in Brazil
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:00.560]   for bouncing and for faking a check.
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:05.280]   My children, unfortunately, as Mast out on his groan, my children have become obsessed with
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:07.920]   Twitter and they tell me all of these stories from Twitter all the time.
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:08.320]   Oh, boy.
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:13.680]   One of them is that allegedly there's an issue about Santos' immigration process.
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.520]   Oh, my god.
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:16.000]   Oh, my god.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:16.640]   Qualified.
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:18.000]   He's undocumented.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:18.880]   But in Congress--
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:19.360]   Yeah.
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:23.200]   Congress, there was no mechanism for removing him.
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:26.400]   So anyway, here he is singing a song.
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.000]   I have a feeling this is a poggerfall.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:34.320]   It's amazing what computers can do these days, isn't it?
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:35.040]   Deep fake.
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:38.240]   That's really quite well done.
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:39.440]   It is.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:41.920]   That lip sync is excellent made with Revive.
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:43.680]   That's really good.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:44.160]   Wow.
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:45.840]   I want to know how they do that.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:46.400]   OK.
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.000]   Well, look at the eyebrows, sir.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:48.480]   Yeah.
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:49.280]   At some point, too.
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:52.000]   Imagine what you could do with clips from the putchos.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.160]   Yeah, at some point, you won't have to record this anymore, Leo.
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:54.800]   You just do it.
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:55.520]   Oh, that's--
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:56.640]   I'm waiting for that day.
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:56:57.440]   Yeah.
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.400]   There's a lot of them.
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:00.320]   He's waiting for talking about it for three years.
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:05.840]   Now, you know, I realized, actually, in all sincerity that I have no friends
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:07.680]   aside from the-- you guys, so--
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:11.200]   So distorted.
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:12.640]   I'm all by myself if I--
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:13.600]   Oh, my god.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:15.200]   If I didn't do this show, I'd do it.
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:15.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:17.280]   You guys are my best buds.
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:19.200]   So thank you.
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:19.920]   What's their buck?
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:22.240]   Thank you for keeping me company.
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:24.000]   It's really actually why I started--
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:27.040]   early days was I wanted to talk to all the people I worked with at Tech TV.
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:27.520]   Oh, yeah.
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.360]   And it was an excuse to get them together.
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:33.120]   And honestly, this is my entire social life.
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:36.480]   So I guess I'll keep doing it for a while,
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:38.480]   unless I want to start singing all by myself.
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:41.760]   Thank you, Glenn Fleischman, for filling in for Stacey's--
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:42.320]   Yeah, Glenn.
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:43.360]   --for the next week.
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:45.280]   It is always a pleasure to see you.
[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:48.960]   Always much fun at Glenn.fun.
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:53.520]   Anything you want to-- you're on many a podcast.
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:55.360]   I know you do a lot of stuff with the incomparable.
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:58:00.000]   Yeah, we just recorded our Best of 2022 episode,
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.120]   apparently in 2023.
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:02.720]   You know, that's how things go sometimes.
[02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:03.200]   But--
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:04.000]   It'd be like that.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:04.960]   Yeah.
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:05.520]   You're the--
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:06.320]   Carful.com.
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:10.560]   Mac911 columnist at Macworld magazine.
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:11.040]   A lot of fun.
[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:12.800]   A lot of fun.
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:14.720]   You created 100 tiny type--
[02:58:14.720 --> 02:58:17.680]   the 100 tiny type museum in time capsules,
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:20.560]   and wrote and published about six centuries of type and printing.
[02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:24.320]   And everybody should go to the new site.
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:25.520]   Say it again.
[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:27.520]   Sheet happens.
[02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:28.320]   Shift happens.
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:28.800]   Shift.
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:29.200]   Yeah.
[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:31.520]   I don't really worry about that F.
[02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:32.160]   It's--
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:33.200]   Shift happens.
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:34.400]   Shift happens.
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:34.880]   That site.
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:35.920]   That site.
[02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:36.720]   And it's beautiful.
[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:39.440]   There's a 3D interactive book you can look at.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:39.680]   Yeah.
[02:58:39.680 --> 02:58:40.480]   This is not--
[02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:41.280]   Who did this?
[02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:43.040]   This is really well done.
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:44.880]   Marcine Wissery, the author of this book.
[02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:45.840]   So I'm the midwife.
[02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:46.960]   He's the author.
[02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:49.360]   He's getting birth to this 10 pound baby.
[02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:51.280]   Actually, pretty good, right?
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:52.560]   It's a pretty good sized baby, actually.
[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:53.040]   I was.
[02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:53.840]   Yeah.
[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:54.400]   Yeah.
[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:55.680]   She designed this whole--
[02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:57.760]   He used some libraries and put this all together.
[02:58:57.760 --> 02:58:58.480]   But the site--
[02:58:58.480 --> 02:58:59.120]   There's a game.
[02:58:59.120 --> 02:59:00.880]   If you want to figure out how well you know a keyboard,
[02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:02.480]   he built a game on this site.
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:03.520]   You can drag--
[02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:07.120]   as a timed process where you drag keys onto a Mac layout
[02:59:07.120 --> 02:59:10.160]   or a PC layout to see how much you remember from memory.
[02:59:10.160 --> 02:59:11.280]   So it's just--
[02:59:11.280 --> 02:59:12.720]   And he-- oh my god.
[02:59:12.720 --> 02:59:15.440]   This is eight years of his life so far.
[02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:17.040]   And it's great.
[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:18.000]   It's really well written.
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:19.040]   It's very entertaining.
[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:20.880]   You'll find the stories about Alger Hiss in it.
[02:59:20.880 --> 02:59:25.040]   And a Nobel Prize winning physicist who became the guy who was one of the
[02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:27.920]   developers of the concepts behind lasers
[02:59:27.920 --> 02:59:33.280]   became obsessed with creating a laser powered type writer or eraser.
[02:59:33.280 --> 02:59:35.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:35.840]   Not kidding.
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:36.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:36.800]   Not kidding.
[02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:37.760]   Lady Deschuio, you're a book.
[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:39.280]   He had a way to re-rise a chapter.
[02:59:39.280 --> 02:59:42.000]   It's like, I have this house to go in.
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.640]   You will also learn the true identity of Mavis Beacon.
[02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:45.200]   So--
[02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:45.920]   Mavis Beacon.
[02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:47.360]   It's very-- it's a very interesting story.
[02:59:47.360 --> 02:59:48.960]   Yes, it is.
[02:59:48.960 --> 02:59:50.640]   Wow, this is great.
[02:59:50.640 --> 02:59:53.920]   A story of the photo on page 688.
[02:59:53.920 --> 02:59:56.880]   That's a basic program?
[02:59:56.880 --> 02:59:57.840]   No, it's a--
[02:59:57.840 --> 02:59:58.480]   Yeah.
[02:59:58.480 --> 02:59:59.040]   It's four trampers.
[02:59:59.040 --> 02:59:59.520]   It goes back.
[02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:01.520]   This is even before that.
[03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:05.120]   It's been fun because Margeton's been hunting people down
[03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:06.880]   for photo rights and things.
[03:00:06.880 --> 03:00:10.400]   And at one point, he was trying to find the keyboard that was developed
[03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:12.000]   that had the most keys on it.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:13.200]   And he had some candidates.
[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:13.760]   I forget which one.
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:14.720]   I think they were one of the Polish--
[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:16.240]   he's originally from Poland.
[03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:18.560]   There might be one in a museum there.
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:19.760]   But he went-- at one point, he's like,
[03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:23.280]   "I'd like to use this different photo that was taken of this physicist,
[03:00:23.280 --> 03:00:23.840]   but he's dead."
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:26.880]   I'm like, "What if you contacted this fellow who is his friend?"
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:30.000]   So he contacts this guy who was also in his 70s, still alive,
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.200]   another Nobel prize winner.
[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:32.160]   He's like, "Oh, why don't you--
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:33.520]   Here's how you reach his daughter."
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:35.760]   And the daughter's like, "Sure, you can use a picture of my dad."
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:37.360]   I mean, it's that kind of journey.
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:39.360]   It's just--
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:40.800]   Now it's work on the photo clearance of this thing.
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:41.760]   Must have been awful.
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:42.240]   Yeah.
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:43.520]   He's done it all.
[03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:45.680]   This is, like I said, I've been the editor.
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:51.120]   I'm the crowd source crowdfunding manager working on the printing side of it.
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:53.680]   And he's his big old baby.
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:54.560]   And this is hard.
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:56.880]   I-- where the hell does the end go?
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:57.840]   I can't--
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:00:59.840]   Oh, you're trying to figure out the keyboard?
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:00.640]   I can't.
[03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:01.680]   It's a time to--
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:03.120]   Hey, I'm losing.
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:03.600]   I'm losing.
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:04.560]   Did that look at your keyboard?
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:06.720]   Uh, Q-W-E-R-T.
[03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:08.400]   And your head start typing now.
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:10.560]   Oh my god, I have no idea where the end is.
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:11.120]   There it is.
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:13.040]   He also found that the great study--
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:34.160]   So that's not a wonderful story though.
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:34.800]   I like that.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:35.360]   Because they kept--
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:36.480]   Yeah, he did it.
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:37.200]   He created it.
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:38.160]   But there's no reason.
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:39.920]   You can type typewriter on the home keys, right?
[03:01:39.920 --> 03:01:40.640]   That was one thing.
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:42.240]   You only need the top row.
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:43.760]   And all these stories have been invented.
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:45.520]   Or it's was supposed to slow you down.
[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:45.920]   Not at all.
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:47.200]   He invented a keyboard there.
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:49.520]   The type bars didn't hit each other.
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:51.040]   And then that was a prototype.
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:55.040]   And the keyboard layout remained, but not the keyboard.
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:56.080]   That was B.
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:58.240]   That was back in the days we had a type blind.
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:01:59.920]   You were actually typing without C letters.
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:00.880]   I don't use.
[03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:02.320]   I never use B.
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:03.520]   So it's--
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:05.200]   All the L is.
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:05.760]   What is that?
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:06.880]   Is that a capital P?
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:08.080]   Oh, I guess it is.
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:09.120]   Oh, god.
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:10.560]   I have no idea.
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:12.160]   You know where the P is?
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:12.720]   Not there either.
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:14.320]   I have no idea.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:14.880]   So I'm going to--
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:16.160]   That's A-P-F.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:16.880]   You're right.
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:18.320]   I'm not supposed to look at that.
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:20.080]   This is good.
[03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:21.360]   But you can type how fast you type.
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:23.600]   You probably type like 70, 90 words minute.
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:24.080]   Exactly.
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:24.800]   I could type.
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:25.520]   But you don't know.
[03:02:25.520 --> 03:02:26.240]   Your brain doesn't know.
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:27.440]   No, my brain doesn't know.
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:27.920]   Yeah.
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:30.080]   For the people at home, type the word stewardesses
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:32.240]   if you're a touch-typer and see what your fingers do.
[03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:33.440]   Just type that.
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:33.920]   I know.
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:35.120]   I can't spell it right.
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:35.840]   So I'm done.
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:36.960]   It's all--
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:38.480]   It's all in the same area.
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:39.360]   Yeah.
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:40.720]   Yeah, it's for all four fingers.
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:41.200]   There's words.
[03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:42.320]   There's actually some in the book.
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:44.800]   But there's words that you can type with left
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:46.160]   or right hand only.
[03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:47.440]   Stewardesses is really hard.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:50.400]   If you type it three times, your hand will cramp up.
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:52.000]   Yeah, because this is all the left hand.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.360]   And it's just right there.
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:54.640]   You're like, oh, it's like--
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:56.480]   Oh, I used to type stuff for a magazine
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:02:58.080]   called Cascade magazine.
[03:02:58.080 --> 03:02:59.520]   And I would be typing cascade.
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:00.800]   It's cascades of my hand would go--
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:03.840]   Oh, you can't type the word steward.
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:04.800]   Wow.
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:06.080]   Thank you, Glenn.
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:07.600]   Thank you so much, Glenn.
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.920]   Jeff Jarvis is the one and only Leonard Town Professor
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:15.440]   for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark.
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:16.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:17.920]   Herr to the School of Journalism
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:20.240]   at the City University of New York.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:22.960]   Let's just pick one at random here.
[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:24.880]   Lives in tomato fields.
[03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:25.360]   He--
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:26.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:27.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:29.120]   --lived.
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:31.920]   He's trapped in the jungle gym of life.
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:34.720]   He's a disaster in the grocery store.
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:39.840]   And pizza menu cover boy, which is handwritten.
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:41.760]   I thought of somebody else who hated to be the other day
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:42.760]   to have a little spic and remove--
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:44.600]   Nickel millionaire, Craig Crock.
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:46.520]   Frank Sinatra called him a bum.
[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:47.680]   It's all here.
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:48.760]   That was a classic.
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:50.720]   It's all here.
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:51.840]   Thank you, Jeff.
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:55.640]   Antbro it, twit.tv/hophands on photography.
[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:57.680]   When is it-- what's the next to hop?
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:03:59.280]   Your first hop of the year.
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:00.760]   Oh, the first end of the year, we're
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:03.840]   going to take a look at some creative product photography.
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:05.320]   So stay tuned for that.
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:06.560]   And we want to get you--
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:08.280]   --random product and get ready to shoot.
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:11.000]   We want to get you answering some photographic questions
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:12.680]   on our new show, Ask the Tech Guys, which
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:17.680]   debuts Mike Asargent and I 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:18.680]   this Sunday.
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:19.200]   Good stuff.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:21.960]   And we're going to bring in as many contributors from the twit
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:24.560]   as we can to answer questions.
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:27.280]   But I'll tell you what, I'll find a good question for you
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:28.440]   and I'll send it to you.
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:30.760]   And you can either join us live or--
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:32.640]   I'm telling people to record.
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:34.280]   Get out your phone and record the answer.
[03:04:34.280 --> 03:04:35.000]   That's cool.
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.040]   Yeah, it's going to be-- I cannot wait.
[03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:37.600]   You got it.
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:39.480]   You got the lighter type of questions?
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:39.920]   Let them out.
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:41.320]   I can probably do it.
[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:44.280]   The next time, a typeface question,
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:45.960]   variable fonts, good or bad.
[03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:47.040]   Next time that comes up.
[03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:49.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:51.440]   I will get you guys on.
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:52.560]   What's a flong?
[03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:54.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:55.680]   Oh, it's along with you.
[03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:56.200]   Don't.
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:04:56.840]   Just tell them.
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:05:01.200]   Actually, I think we're going to be kind of topical this week
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:04.080]   and I'm going to show you how to move off LastPass
[03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:05.160]   onto another one.
[03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:07.080]   Oh, doctor.
[03:05:07.080 --> 03:05:07.600]   Yeah.
[03:05:07.600 --> 03:05:08.360]   That's a good one.
[03:05:08.360 --> 03:05:08.880]   Oh, doctor.
[03:05:08.880 --> 03:05:10.880]   Can I ask you an uncomfortable question, Leo?
[03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:13.360]   Sure.
[03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:16.600]   If LastPass were still the studio sponsor, what all those--
[03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:17.680]   Oh, no, they wouldn't be.
[03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:18.640]   And I can tell you why.
[03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:21.440]   They came back to us not so long ago.
[03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:24.240]   And we turned them down.
[03:05:24.240 --> 03:05:25.240]   Wow.
[03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:27.240]   Wow.
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:31.040]   And it's really simple.
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:32.920]   When they were our studio sponsor,
[03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:35.080]   they really were the best thing out there.
[03:05:35.080 --> 03:05:36.320]   Yeah, they were.
[03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:38.000]   And Steve at Ben and I had every--
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:38.840]   Steve, for instance.
[03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:39.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:43.520]   I had every reason to trust Steve's opinion.
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:44.680]   I was using it myself.
[03:05:44.680 --> 03:05:47.600]   We still use LastPass Enterprise.
[03:05:47.600 --> 03:05:50.320]   I was very happy when Bitwarden approached us,
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:54.120]   because I had already moved off LastPass to Bitwarden,
[03:05:54.120 --> 03:05:54.960]   because it's open source.
[03:05:54.960 --> 03:05:55.720]   And I'm a big fan.
[03:05:55.720 --> 03:05:58.520]   And this is, again, another-- that lesson of centralized
[03:05:58.520 --> 03:06:00.240]   is not as good as decentralized.
[03:06:00.240 --> 03:06:03.200]   Open is better than proprietary or closed.
[03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:04.920]   And so I had already moved to Bitwarden.
[03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:06.160]   So I was thrilled.
[03:06:06.160 --> 03:06:07.960]   Unfortunately, as an open service project,
[03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:10.080]   they don't have much money to spend on advertising.
[03:06:10.080 --> 03:06:13.640]   But whereas LastPass had plenty.
[03:06:13.640 --> 03:06:17.320]   But this is why you got to join Club Doit.
[03:06:17.320 --> 03:06:18.760]   Because--
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:19.640]   Please, and thank you.
[03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:21.720]   Please, and thank you.
[03:06:21.720 --> 03:06:24.560]   Yeah, of course we wouldn't do it now.
[03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:26.360]   Absolutely not.
[03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:28.360]   And you know why the other reason I wouldn't do it?
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:30.720]   Not because, frankly, I think it's probably better
[03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:33.440]   to use LastPass than no password manager, right?
[03:06:33.440 --> 03:06:36.360]   And there's no reason to think that if you use LastPass
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:38.160]   today, you would somehow be at risk.
[03:06:38.160 --> 03:06:40.280]   But the main reason we wouldn't do it
[03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:42.320]   is because we'd lose the trust of our audience.
[03:06:42.320 --> 03:06:46.160]   And our advertisements have no value
[03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:48.720]   if the audience can't trust that when I say something
[03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:51.200]   that's good, it's good.
[03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:52.280]   Aiming to that.
[03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:55.800]   It would devalue our company too much.
[03:06:55.800 --> 03:06:57.440]   Thank you for that.
[03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:00.600]   Which is also why you joined the damned club.
[03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:02.440]   Yeah.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:05.480]   Because he turns away people to protect you.
[03:07:05.480 --> 03:07:07.840]   Oh, we do it more often than I should.
[03:07:07.840 --> 03:07:10.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:13.080]   I'm very glad-- we had one crypto advertiser,
[03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:14.520]   which was a mistake in hindsight.
[03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:16.400]   But it really was for a credit card
[03:07:16.400 --> 03:07:19.000]   that paid rewards for crypto was block-fi.
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.720]   And I said, I'm really uncomfortable.
[03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:24.640]   Let's not do that.
[03:07:24.640 --> 03:07:26.720]   E-cigarettes, we've turned down gambling.
[03:07:26.720 --> 03:07:27.800]   Oh, boy.
[03:07:27.800 --> 03:07:29.480]   I think we probably could have made a lot of money
[03:07:29.480 --> 03:07:31.720]   with betting apps.
[03:07:31.720 --> 03:07:32.560]   I'm up.
[03:07:32.560 --> 03:07:33.360]   But I just--
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:33.840]   I'm up.
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:36.360]   There's some things I'm just not comfortable with.
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:37.440]   And thank god, Lisa.
[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:38.440]   Oh, the one that--
[03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:38.840]   Lisa has--
[03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:42.000]   doesn't overrule me, she says, OK.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.600]   Well, what about those ads for pure uncut everclear?
[03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:47.040]   I love it.
[03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:48.240]   A little on the--
[03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:49.120]   I don't mind--
[03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:50.200]   I don't mind--
[03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:52.840]   I've actually thought about this.
[03:07:52.840 --> 03:07:56.320]   At one point, I think we did wine ads for a long time.
[03:07:56.320 --> 03:07:56.800]   Oh, wine.
[03:07:56.800 --> 03:07:58.640]   Wine clubs and stuff.
[03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:04.240]   We had a beer-- remember that we had a beer thing that you could--
[03:08:04.240 --> 03:08:06.040]   There's a little kegerator thing.
[03:08:06.040 --> 03:08:07.240]   Is it USB-roll?
[03:08:07.240 --> 03:08:07.760]   No.
[03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:09.840]   No, but the idea was that you would join a club
[03:08:09.840 --> 03:08:11.360]   and they'd send you a little--
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:12.680]   A little kegerator thing.
[03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:13.680]   A little kegerator thing.
[03:08:13.680 --> 03:08:14.200]   That's cute.
[03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:15.200]   Where they call it--
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:15.880]   D'Onne, John.
[03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:19.080]   A little thing of beer.
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:19.600]   Pony?
[03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:22.480]   It was before my time, but I remember seeing the sponsor
[03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:23.280]   on the show.
[03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:24.200]   Yeah, that's great.
[03:08:24.200 --> 03:08:25.960]   And there are a lot of people, somebody in the chair,
[03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:28.400]   saying, well, don't forget you accepted manscaping.
[03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:29.760]   I still use manscaping.
[03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:30.760]   There's nothing wrong.
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:31.720]   We don't want to know.
[03:08:31.720 --> 03:08:33.200]   There's nothing wrong.
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:34.400]   We keep in here.
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:35.800]   You're a little body is.
[03:08:35.800 --> 03:08:38.320]   Sweet.
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:39.400]   We're just swimming.
[03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:41.800]   That's why.
[03:08:41.800 --> 03:08:43.880]   If I advertise it, I use it, man.
[03:08:43.880 --> 03:08:46.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[03:08:46.360 --> 03:08:50.560]   When you got hair in your pit, turn to Twits.
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:52.240]   That's a slogan we will not be using.
[03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:53.520]   Thank you, Ellen.
[03:08:53.520 --> 03:08:54.880]   Thank you, Jeff.
[03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:55.480]   Thank you.
[03:08:55.480 --> 03:08:57.880]   We do Twitter every Wednesday afternoon.
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:08:59.600]   You see, it's when we get together with friends
[03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:01.440]   that we have the most fun.
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:03.200]   I hope you'll join us every Wednesday
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:05.360]   at 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern.
[03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:07.000]   2200 UTC.
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.760]   You can watch or listen live at live.twit.tv.
[03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:12.160]   Chat with us at irc.twit.tv.
[03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:13.520]   Open all.
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:14.920]   And if you're a club twit member, of course,
[03:09:14.920 --> 03:09:17.560]   you have your own special private chat
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:19.920]   where your feet will be massaged.
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:24.880]   And you will be taken care of with a fine cocktail
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:25.600]   in the disquieting--
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:26.560]   By Ant himself.
[03:09:26.560 --> 03:09:29.320]   Ant will make you a little something.
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:30.960]   And then, yes, I'm keeping talking
[03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:32.840]   so we get to the three hour markets for important.
[03:09:32.840 --> 03:09:35.120]   We have every show.
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:37.080]   Go to the point where you actually
[03:09:37.080 --> 03:09:38.400]   have to run to the bathroom.
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:43.160]   Oh, yeah, we got the Gizfiz coming up.
[03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:45.720]   Get on to man shows at twit.tv/twig.
[03:09:45.720 --> 03:09:48.760]   Subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:51.120]   There is, in fact, a YouTube channel dedicated to this show.
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:53.040]   Believe it or not.
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:54.720]   All of that usual.
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:56.640]   Thank you for your support.
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:09:59.840]   And we will see you next time on "This Week" in Gobo.
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:02.000]   Now, stay tuned.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:07.120]   The first Gizfiz for a Wednesday evening is coming up next.
[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:08.000]   It's fizz time.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:12.200]   This is a new only business step.
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:14.080]   The world is changing rapidly.
[03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:16.880]   So rapidly, in fact, that it's hard to keep up.
[03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:19.480]   That's why Micah Sargent and I, Jason Howell,
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:22.000]   talk with the people making and breaking the tech news
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.400]   on Tech News Weekly every Thursday.
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:26.680]   They know these stories better than anyone.
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:29.840]   So why not get them to talk about it in their own words?
[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:32.520]   Subscribe to Tech News Weekly and you won't miss a beat
[03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:35.240]   every Thursday at twit.tv.
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:38.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:10:38.600 --> 03:10:41.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:44.540]   (upbeat music)
[03:10:44.540 --> 03:10:46.960]   (soft music)
