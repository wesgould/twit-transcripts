[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for Twig this week at Google Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   So is Mad Cots.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.320]   We're going to have a great conversation,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.000]   including a couple of interesting patents from Google.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.640]   Plus, during the actual show, we are going to solve
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.360]   a pesky problem plaguing Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.560]   More alliteration ahead.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.320]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.120]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.480]   From people you trust.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   This is Twig.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.520]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.480]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720]   It's time for Twig's annual audience survey.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.160]   And we want to hear from you.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.440]   Please visit twit.tv/survey and let us know what you think.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.960]   It only takes a few minutes.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.400]   And your anonymous feedback will help us make Twit even better.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   We thank you so much for your continued support, twit.tv/survey.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:10.200]   This is Twig this week in Google, episode 295,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600]   recorded Wednesday, April 8, 2015.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.400]   Bovine avoidance mechanism.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200]   It's time for Twig this week at Google, a show
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840]   where we cover everything that's not covered on any other show,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.360]   which is just basically everything we want to talk about.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080]   Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.800]   and of course because of Jeff Jarvis, journalism.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.520]   He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.240]   Hey.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.760]   Blogger@buzzmachine.com, author of many wonderful books.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.040]   Also joined today by-- and we love having him on, Matt Cutts.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.880]   Googlers.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.560]   Cast in the world.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.520]   Long time Googler.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.320]   Good to see everybody.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.840]   How are you?
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.680]   Matt.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.280]   We should say Matt does not speak for Google when he's on this show.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.040]   But we love having him on.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280]   He gives us a lot of insight.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.240]   And I was really disheartened a couple of weeks ago
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.040]   to read that you had left Google.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280]   You are on hiatus still, right?
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.800]   I am.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.600]   I'm still on leave, yes.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.640]   And so this was why I was a little credible also,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   because it was like three days before April Fool's.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   Some SEO company announced they'd hired you.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.360]   Yes.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   And they also had a picture of me from some search
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.240]   conference a few years back.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.800]   So it looked relatively credible.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400]   It was very credible.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.040]   Except for one thing.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.400]   I knew you-- I just thought that can't be--
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.480]   no.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.440]   That would be like the most massive sell out ever.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.480]   Well, and for the first five minutes,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.840]   I thought it was really funny.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.080]   And I was just going to let it ride for three or four days.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.920]   And even though they didn't talk to me or ask me in advance,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.720]   I was like, that's pretty well done.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.240]   But then I got an email from someone pretty high up at Google
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.960]   who was like, just to see people, right?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.800]   And I was like, why don't I go ahead and clarify that,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.760]   just so people don't go stressed out,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.160]   get a little crazy or something.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   I just-- it didn't seem possible.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.920]   Now, we should explain that your job at Google
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.040]   is fighting web spam, spam search results in the spam.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.360]   And you speak, as this company mentioned,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.560]   a lot at SEO conferences and so forth.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.240]   But the idea of you going to work at an SEO--
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   by the way, this is my next project, Auto SEO I loved.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.960]   We talked about that as well.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.080]   Yeah, that was surprisingly enough.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   About 4,000 people signed up for this April Fool's joke
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.160]   that I did that said, I'm going to-- it's a new product.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.040]   It does all your SEO for you.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.000]   It handles mobile and handles social.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.040]   And here it is over at SEO.Ninja, which I had thanks
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.960]   to a friend, Avinash.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.680]   And so people believed it.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920]   And so a few of them signed up because they're like, oh,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.720]   I want to hear about more about the joke.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.160]   But a lot of people signed up because they're like, yes,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.680]   I would like all my SEO taking care of for me.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.000]   Thanks very much.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.800]   Well, it actually was a--
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.360]   it subtly fit in with your message at Webmaster Tools,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.960]   those great videos you make, which
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.000]   is the best SEOs to make the best content.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.320]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.880]   Absolutely.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.360]   Our goal is that people never even
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.600]   have to think about this stuff.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.360]   So it was a little bit of a play on that.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.880]   SEO, somebody's saying, what is this?
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.960]   I haven't been about the joke.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.480]   SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.240]   And while there is some stuff you can
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.840]   do to make your site more useful, more--
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.080]   things like having a site map--
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.600]   Google says this is a good thing.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.960]   It helps them search it.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.280]   But a lot of it's snake oil stuff.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.960]   If you get somebody calling you or emailing you saying,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.000]   I can put you number one in search results,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.880]   guaranteed snake oil.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.920]   Seriously, evil obfuscation.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.720]   I don't know what it is.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.840]   Well, yeah, I feel like it's too bad because I think
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.960]   there are some serious SEO folks.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.600]   And you've spoken at SEO conferences as have I.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.600]   And there are plenty of great white-hat SEOs.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.640]   It's just most of them have plenty of business.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.880]   So you're not going to get cold email by someone who
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.160]   is going to be guaranteed white-hat.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.120]   So you've got to check your references.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.160]   And the people who know their job usually have more than enough
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.920]   business already.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.120]   So they're not reaching out to you.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.200]   I want to also, as long as you're on Matt's blog, which is
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.360]   matcuts.com, go watch the talk you did.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.560]   I think it's your alma mater, right?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.840]   UNC Chapel Hill?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.240]   Yeah, I went to grad school there.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.000]   So got to go back and talk for about 45 minutes or so about
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.040]   lessons learned from the early days of Google.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.920]   And it's kind of fun.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.080]   It's not super technical.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.440]   It's more like, here's some stuff that I picked up along
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.840]   the way.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   And we love that stuff.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.120]   It was a good talk.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.920]   So I didn't realize you were at that little back and forth.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.600]   And it was not a heated battle I had with Sundar Pichai in the
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.000]   early days of the Chromebook.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.360]   I didn't realize you were standing there.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   Sorry.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   It's great.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.240]   Because Google often has a Christmas party and the
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.120]   Linvite journalist.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.040]   And so the last time I was invited, I just want to say.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   Oh, no.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.400]   No.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.040]   Well, that's the mistake, because it was really good to
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.600]   have you there.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I think at that time, only the CR48 had come out.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.200]   And so it was kind of fair to say, look, what am I going to
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.360]   do with this?
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.320]   Because it was hard to see the potential at that time.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.480]   And honestly, a lot of the potential hadn't been realized
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.040]   yet.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.440]   And so it was fun to watch the back and forth where I think
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.320]   Sundar could see what was coming.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   And you were sort of like, the state of the world is not
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.800]   good enough.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   Yeah, why would you spend that much money and carry around
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.920]   that big a thing to just use a browser?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.320]   And I think even then I said, I could see the value in a
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.640]   company where they want to constrain what their employees
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.840]   do online or on the computer or a school where you don't want
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   kids playing Minecraft during class.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.160]   But I have to say, it's very generous of you to defend me.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   But it is true.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.480]   I have completely come around.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.040]   And I love the Pixel.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.280]   You haven't gotten the new one yet.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.480]   And I'm really missing the USB-C where you can click in the
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.720]   power on either side of it.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.680]   Oh, that is great.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.880]   Two USB ports.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.080]   Now I want everybody to put Type-C connectors in
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.440]   everything.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.600]   And I finally got my USB-C to HDMI.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.760]   Nice.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.320]   I need to order some from Google.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.880]   The other great thing is, I don't know what Apple's going
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.720]   to charge for these things.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.240]   A lot.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240]   A bunch of Google's going to be less.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640]   Apple has an adapter because Apple's MacBook comes out
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.040]   this Friday and will have a single Type-C connector.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.360]   And they already are selling an $80 dollar dongle.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.160]   But it has regular USB, HDMI, and then a Type-C for power.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.600]   But $80.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.800]   How much was the Google one?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.160]   Oh, I forget it.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.240]   I mean, it's on the side.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.360]   If you go to the--
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.800]   I should buy a few.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.760]   And Type-C is Type-C.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.160]   So that'll work with Apple just as well.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yeah, I bought an extra power adapter.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.920]   That's like half a Chromebook right there.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.840]   That's ridiculous, $79.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.320]   That's ridiculous.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.840]   Although, hey, we should point out the new Pixel.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.240]   The new Pixel starts at $1,000.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.640]   And if you want to get the ludicrously speedy one--
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.480]   Which I did.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.640]   That Jeff has.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.440]   That's $300 more.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.880]   How many people, Matt, at Google--
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.000]   A, how many-- what proportion of the people you work with
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.080]   use pixels, and what do they really use them for?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.720]   That's a good question.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.400]   So almost everybody uses either Max or pixels,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.480]   or Chromebooks.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.840]   I'd say maybe--
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.240]   I'm just taking a total guess from what I've seen.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.200]   Maybe about a third of the people use pixels.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.280]   And a lot of that is if you're a manager, you're just doing
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:41.680]   email.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.800]   You're not doing hard work coding.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.840]   Although, you can ask to say, Leo, I
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.800]   loved where you were talking about doing coding in the web
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.160]   browser.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.000]   That was very cool.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.760]   It's coding.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.160]   I now use everywhere, K-O-D-I-N-G.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.040]   Because well, that's exactly what you want.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.280]   If you're working in any language for web apps,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.600]   you want it to be somewhere where you can publish it
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.480]   immediately and try it.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.920]   And so it's really great.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.720]   And then you can also SSH to a server.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.960]   I was starting to set up a server and somebody tweeted me,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.520]   oh, you should look at coding.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.160]   And it's great.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.640]   So that was the last-- that in Photoshop
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   with the last bastion of stuff I was doing on desktop
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.880]   computing.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.320]   And boy, I have to feel like this has really changed.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   So when I talked to Sundar five years ago,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.560]   this was in the distant future.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.520]   Yeah, I think you had a very good point whenever
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.080]   you were talking to-- you were like, I don't quite see anyway.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.920]   And I wasn't angry.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.240]   I was just saying, explain to me what's going on.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.560]   He was great.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.880]   I came away very impressed with Sundar Pichai.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.440]   His thoughtful, his intelligence, his thoughtful demeanor,
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.160]   and his calmness in the face of what he might well have
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.560]   received as an attack, because that was his baby.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.280]   It's Chrome OS.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.800]   Well, I love that Sundar, coming from the Chrome world,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.760]   really believes in open, federated standards.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.600]   Yes, I love that.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.200]   Chrome is just a paragon of how things should work,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.880]   in my opinion.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.120]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.040]   The adapter, Jeff, isn't cheap.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   It's 40 bucks on that.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.880]   40 bucks.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.920]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.120]   But I'm going to get--
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.240]   I should get a few, because I have a feeling this will be
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.160]   an high demand thing about apples,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.520]   is you can continue to charge while you're connected to the HDMI.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.960]   So Jeff, actually, let's do some Chromebook self-help here.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   Because Jeff, you're seeing ad pop-ups on your Chromebook?
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.640]   Yeah, they're a little--
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.560]   I tweeted it the other day.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.600]   I can't find it right now.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.440]   But it's a little nice little box,
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.320]   and it popped up on the lower right of my screen,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.640]   or just now on your Mac on the upper right of the screen.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.840]   I closed Chrome so I know it's Chrome.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.440]   A major brands like Gap, they pop up--
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.880]   they almost look like a now box, but they don't pop in the same way.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.720]   They pop from the right from the side, right side.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.160]   And I can't figure out where it's coming from.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.600]   I figure it's got to be a rogue extension.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.960]   I don't have that many extensions.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.400]   The most rogue-ish thing I have.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.280]   There, that's it.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.840]   Very good.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.440]   Yes.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.880]   Thank you.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.680]   Oh, boy.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.560]   How do you do that, Jason?
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   Oh, that's the tweet.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.680]   Yeah, I did this Google search for Jeff Jarvis Twitter.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.800]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   That's fine to Chrome.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.480]   You could do it on the internet, right?
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.440]   I found it.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.080]   Yeah, him and 37 posts from Mark Andrese.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.280]   So that came in from the right.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.080]   And I clicked on it and went to the Gap.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.160]   But the key is it's not just in your Chromebook.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.960]   It's everywhere when you use Chrome.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.800]   Yes, so it's always something that travels with Chrome.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.600]   So it's not like the Chromebook itself is besmirched in some way.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.160]   So the chat room has given me a tool that might be useful.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.680]   OK.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.480]   We said, of course, first look in your extensions.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.840]   And Matt said that it's engineered so that if something's
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.320]   in an extension, it will show up in extensions.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:10.880]   But there's also a Chrome memory redirect about memory.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.360]   So Chrome colon slash slash memory dash redirect
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.960]   will show you--
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.560]   Chrome has a top browser built into it.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.280]   But this is just a web-based version of this.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.680]   What the hell do I do with that?
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.400]   That's what we look at.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.200]   Well, you'll see everything that's running in memory,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.280]   including all the extensions.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.360]   So you can say, you could see if there's
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.720]   a rogue extension running in the background or something.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.040]   Yeah, I got looking now.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.120]   I don't see anything.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.960]   Of course, that was on that machine.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.800]   It's weird.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.960]   I just don't-- it just was just not going to bug you.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.000]   Now, if you were using only the Chromebook,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.360]   you could just do a power washer would go away, I think.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.800]   Well, no, because it's got to one stone.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.240]   It will show up in extensions again.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.840]   It's going to be sick.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.760]   Yeah, I mean, what you could do is you could try turning off
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.520]   all your extensions and then turn them on one.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.480]   Yeah, one by one.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.080]   I know the problem is it's such an intermediate.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.200]   Intermittent, yeah.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.080]   Intermittent, yeah.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.360]   Intermittent.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.600]   The ads are very intermittent.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.200]   They've gotten like three in six days.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.760]   Somebody in the chat, I'm saying it's a Chrome notification
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.000]   from Google Now.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.880]   Google Now is not sending me ads.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.720]   That seems strange.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.760]   But you're seeing this on Twitter, Jeff?
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.120]   No, no, no.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.280]   We posted it on Twitter.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.360]   I posted that as a screenshot on Twitter.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.280]   So it's random web pages you're seeing it on, right?
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.120]   It's not any--
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.760]   Yes.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.360]   Like it--
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:38.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.520]   If you're on our Google Drive, you would see it.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.720]   Sometimes, right?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.600]   Unless you have a tab--
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.760]   That just popped up on my Tweet Deck.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   Oh, I could be Tweet Deck doing it.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.800]   And so I don't have Tweet Deck--
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.440]   I don't have Tweet Deck raining on the Apple right now.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.320]   That's a good point.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.000]   Could be, but no.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.920]   And the thing is, it appears off the screen.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.480]   Check your--
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.200]   He's saying check your Chrome notification sources.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.520]   And see, now Chrome has notifications.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.760]   I don't know where to do that, though.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.000]   Wow.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.840]   Here's Gina.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.640]   I don't know if Gina could help you here.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.680]   This is obscure.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.920]   Because on the Apple, it didn't appear on the browser.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.520]   It appeared on the screen all the way over to the far right.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.720]   I got a 27-inch Samsung monitor here.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.560]   So it was two feet away to the right when I closed Chrome.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.160]   Both went away.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.320]   So it was definitely Chrome.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.760]   You should look at your-- I guess your privacy settings.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   You can make sure you have pop-ups turned off.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.680]   And then look at manage exceptions in there
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.040]   and see if you have allowed pop-ups from a site.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.360]   But who would it be?
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.920]   All I have open on the Mac right now is Google stuff.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.160]   So I think it is a good idea.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.120]   Go to Settings, Privacy, which is in the Advanced Settings.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.520]   Click Content Settings.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.440]   Google hides a lot of interesting stuff in the Content Settings.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.840]   Well, that was--
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.280]   I did.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.880]   I did, yeah.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.320]   And then there's a notification thing there.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.920]   And you can manage exceptions.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.760]   So those will be the sites you said yes to for notifications.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.440]   You could see who you've allowed.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.560]   What I would do is clear these all out.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.640]   Or just say, do not allow any-- try that.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.960]   Do not allow any site to show desktop notifications
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.360]   and see if it goes away.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.200]   And then you could look at your exceptions.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.000]   I've never seen that.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.920]   That's a weird thing.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.080]   Yeah, that is strange.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.480]   I haven't seen that either.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.720]   On the bright side, everybody at Google and everybody
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.520]   that watches this weekend, Google is going to be--
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.560]   Yeah, what's--
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.640]   Well, that's why we do it.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.080]   Shoot.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.760]   Jarvis is killing our new revenue stream.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.160]   Damn him.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   Oh, it is.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.840]   You know what?
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.120]   So our chat room has given me a link.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.280]   Thank you, George, to the rich notification page
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.240]   in the google developer.chrome.com.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.880]   And look down here.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.320]   That is the basic notification you're getting.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.920]   See, isn't it?
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.840]   That's what it looks like.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.440]   Looks like it.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.080]   So somebody-- you've installed something that is--
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.560]   Somebody's selling it to a gap.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.040]   Somebody who can get an RFP with the agency
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.360]   for the gap, one would think.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.520]   Unless-- well, I guess no, you know what?
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.600]   It could be an affiliate.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.720]   Could be an affiliate because if you take a look at it,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.840]   up to is one word.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.080]   So it's a gap.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.240]   That's the name that's--
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.040]   I'm telling you, that doesn't look good.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.840]   I wouldn't say so.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.960]   Doesn't it does not look good?
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.120]   Hurry up.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.200]   The urgency is there.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.800]   Click on me, please.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.680]   You do not want to see those.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.040]   That is--
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.320]   No, nobody else is getting this.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.800]   Here's another one from our--
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.120]   Boy, our chat room's good.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.200]   Superuser.com--
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.600]   how to find Chrome extensions that inject ads
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.240]   into any web page I browse.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.120]   Wow.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.320]   If we could harness the power of the chat room
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:23.640]   and do--
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.480]   I think they're great.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.600]   --in aligning with it or something.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   Aren't they great?
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   They're so good.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.000]   So this is-- if you know JavaScript, you can do it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.440]   But they--
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.720]   Pop up exceptions.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.640]   The first one is--
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   Sauna bot, Berlin.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.040]   Wall Street Journal.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.920]   I would look at your extensions really closely
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.960]   and make sure you want the ones you've got.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.720]   Pretty much done that.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.720]   OK.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.480]   I'll just--
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.080]   In the chat room, I'm going to paste a link, which is actually--
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.960]   it shows you where you can manage the exceptions, which
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.240]   sites are allowed to--
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   Nice.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.840]   --notification.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.040]   And I just went through this process myself.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.320]   And so I can see I've allowed docs.google, drive.google,
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.840]   play.spotify.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.160]   And it's a pretty small list.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.480]   So from there, you can go through--
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.920]   OK, I'll go to that.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.400]   Settings, Advanced, Privacy, Content, which
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.800]   is exactly what we said.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.160]   In the dialog that appears, you go down to Notifications
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.800]   and you can manage exceptions.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.560]   Yeah, it's exactly what we were talking about.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.080]   And that's a good thing to know about.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.160]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.160]   Thank you.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.200]   All right, I'll report back next week.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.560]   I love Power Wash.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.880]   I power wash all the time.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.600]   I just power washings the best thing.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.760]   This guy on a super user said it was an extension called
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.560]   "show hide passwords."
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.320]   So there are--
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:49.880]   That was dangerous.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.000]   This is only a good extension.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.360]   That's one to stay away from.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.560]   And we sometimes see behavior where a legit Chrome
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.000]   extension will sell out.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.320]   So people sign up for this extension
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   and it does something useful.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.400]   And then after a while, the guy decides to monetize it
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.000]   and he sells it to--
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.960]   Oh, OK, so here's the weird one now.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.040]   So I go to--
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.200]   I'm sorry, Matt.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.040]   I go to the Content Settings.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.800]   And I go to the Notifications part.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.000]   I have clicked on Do Not Allow at East Side
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.640]   to show desktop notifications.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.000]   I click on Manage Exceptions.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.240]   So then it lists like eBay's there.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   I can't turn them off.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.240]   The other areas--
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.120]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.400]   They're just there.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.160]   They're just there.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:42.480]   Is that true?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.400]   There's no delete.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.600]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.520]   So I can't manage the exceptions.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.840]   You could see what you've accepted.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.360]   Power Wash.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.160]   One of them I can do.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.400]   Matt knows better than anyone.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.160]   And how-- what a constant battle this is--
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.840]   Not yet.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.240]   You know, it's the-- they just overwhelmed you, I guess,
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.520]   with constantly.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.480]   Google, in fact, cut Android malware, they say in half
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.400]   last year, which is interesting.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.080]   1% of Android devices had a harmful application
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.680]   installed in 2014.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.560]   Now, most of those came from third party stores
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.040]   or sideloading.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.640]   When devices had that box unchecked that said,
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.560]   allow third party sources, it was 0.15%.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.000]   So the vast majority came from sideloading.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.240]   But there is a long report which Google has put out
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   a 44 page report talking about all the different kinds
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.200]   of abuse that happens on Android.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.000]   But they announced last year they
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.680]   disabled 200 harmful extensions in Chrome
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.080]   that affected about 14 million users.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.440]   So it's not impossible to get a Chrome extension
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.960]   that, as you point out, Matt, may have started out fine
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.360]   and went rogue because it got sold,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.680]   or just somebody missed it when they approved it.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.040]   Well, as Matt said now, the three or four people
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.880]   at Google who watched this are going to say, hmm.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.280]   I think there will be some very interested people
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.480]   doing some research on it.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.180]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.180]   I was curious.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.180]   I have to be aware of myself.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.180]   Last night I had a-- I subscribed to a New York Times
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.020]   email newsletter because I want to see it,
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.180]   but I hate email newsletter.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.980]   So I want to unsubscribe.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.740]   And so then I click on the unsubscribe,
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.500]   and it takes me to a page and says, you can't do this.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.100]   You have to sign in.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.100]   But it says we're up there on top.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.700]   I'm signed in.
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.260]   It's me.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.700]   Oh, that's frustrating.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.860]   So of course I've had a little wine
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.020]   so I go on to Twitter.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.780]   And of course I have to use the F word.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.300]   I can't even unsubscribe from these F and N.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.740]   So then of course the problem is today
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.620]   there's like five helpful New York Times people
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.620]   try to-- I'll fix it for you.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.180]   And I'm not trying to be mean and nasty.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.540]   I have nothing against the newsletter.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.540]   I just forget that people actually read these tweets.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.460]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.060]   I've been interrupting that.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.940]   I've got to harness the anger carefully.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.500]   That's for sure.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.100]   Yes, one does.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.220]   One needs to do that.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.860]   Yes.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.300]   It's so funny that I just got a text from my son who
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.180]   sent me a text thread.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.020]   He says, is this a sketchy transaction?
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.820]   I'm buying tickets for a concert from a Craigslist dude.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.420]   And he sent me the text exchange.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   And yeah, I think it is actually.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.140]   I'm saying maybe you might arrive at the concert
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.460]   and the tickets were already used.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.540]   There's all sorts of ways you can get.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.820]   They're all out there.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:45.380]   Matt, I was talking to-- we had a police officer here
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:45.860]   the other day.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.460]   I said, it must be hard seeing just the worst every day, day
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:48.980]   and day out.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.820]   Does it get that way, Matt?
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.740]   Is that why you're on such a long hiatus?
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.820]   You're just seeing this constant stuff.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:00.940]   Well, I got to say, it is weird that you want to say,
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.700]   why can't people just be nice?
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.940]   Why can't everybody just be cool and just respect
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.180]   everybody else?
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.740]   Let's just not scan each other.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.900]   And yet somehow something about the internet
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.860]   or maybe just reality brings that out.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.500]   I don't know why.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.300]   But--
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.060]   But you're not dejected to pressed through.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.780]   What are you doing on this hiatus?
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.100]   Yeah, come on.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.500]   Fessum.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.860]   You're holding dinosaurs.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.380]   Is that it?
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.660]   Can I give us the hint?
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.700]   Yeah, yes.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.780]   Here they come.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.900]   Last night, I stayed up late watching a movie next to my wife.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.460]   And--
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.300]   Isn't that nice?
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.780]   Isn't that a nice feeling?
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.860]   It's great.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.020]   Who said you could live a life?
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:52.180]   So do you have a plan to go back at some point?
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.860]   Well, the leaves can still go on for a little while longer.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.580]   So it's like a sub-patical.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.980]   In the next month or so.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.660]   Do they do just--
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.820]   We will have that policy like a sub-patical.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.940]   Yeah, OK.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.260]   They've had policies like that before.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.460]   In fact, they talk about the--
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.300]   in the rundown, there's the how to get a job at Google.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.940]   And that's about a book called Work Rules by Lazlo Bach.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.900]   And I have to say, Lazlo is one of the hidden gems at Google
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.420]   because he does such a great job in the people operation
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.900]   side of things.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.100]   So they try things like, well, let's give us a sub-patical.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.540]   Oh, everybody left after they took the sub-patical.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.820]   OK, we'll try something different.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.220]   Let's subsidize it for you.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.660]   See whether that helps retouch and really
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.580]   could be a bit of experimenting with things.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.740]   So he's written all that up in a book called Work Rules
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.340]   and sort of says, here's our interviewing habits.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.900]   And there's a lot of people that think
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.620]   we just use brain teasers and puzzles.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.420]   And so he sort of sets that straight
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.660]   and talks about the sorts of interviews that do well
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.420]   and those sorts of things.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.780]   How often do you, when you're working, as opposed
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.020]   to lazy and around watching movies late, how often just--
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.220]   would you say you end up interviewing people?
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.420]   And how often are the people who end up working for you
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.220]   or you're part of a process interviewing
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.260]   people elsewhere?
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.060]   It's pretty wild because they try
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.900]   to take the attitude that hiring is the most important thing
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.100]   you can do at Google.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.380]   Because if you can get somebody good, really,
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:22.020]   A+ level on board, then you've enabled all this extra work
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.500]   that you can do.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.380]   So they actually have little badges on the internal system
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.740]   where you can say, I've done 150 interviews
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.500]   or I've done 200 interviews or something like that.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.340]   So everybody is supposed to.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.420]   Not everybody does, but everybody is supposed to chip in
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.980]   so that you get a wide spectrum of people,
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.660]   a lot of different diversity in interviewing people
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.500]   to figure out what works and what doesn't work.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.420]   Who decides who interviews whom?
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.940]   They don't interview it like, I'm the hiring manager
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.860]   and I want to fill a specific role for my specific job,
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.380]   usually.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.740]   Rather, everybody says, look, we need this many people
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.660]   in search quality and this many people in Google X.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.820]   And then we hire the smartest people that we can.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.780]   And then we work with those people after they've
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.340]   gone through the hiring committee all the way
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.540]   to Larry or whatever, where you say, OK, now what
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.380]   are you interested in?
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.980]   And then some people bid on the candidates who are coming in.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.140]   I think that was kind of interesting because I met
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.820]   somebody, a young woman graduating from a cow
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.420]   with honors, had gotten a job at Google.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.780]   I said, what are you going to be doing?
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.540]   She said, I don't know yet.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.900]   She'll find out later when she arrives.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.820]   Well, and--
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.340]   Right.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.020]   And to be fair, I'm sort of a weird exception.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.300]   Most people don't stay in the same area for 10 or 15 years.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.780]   Often after four or five years or depending on your role,
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.700]   two or three years, you might switch and try something
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.340]   no different.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.820]   Do you-- does Larry really review every candidate?
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.180]   Come on.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.500]   That's a lot of-- 6,000 people last year.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.660]   That's 500 a month.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.620]   That's 25 a day.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   He used to in the early days.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.540]   These days, I'm guessing they send him the data
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.100]   and he maybe does spot checks.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.660]   I don't know if you really--
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.980]   You'd have to ask him, but he did in the early days.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.620]   Well, that makes sense in the early days,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.900]   especially when in the early days,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.340]   you're really forming the company culture.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:18.180]   And those first 100 or 200 hires, maybe for 1,000 hires,
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.220]   even, are really going to set a tone that's going to continue.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.180]   It's very hard to change once you've done that.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.180]   So I think that's the time to be very involved.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.340]   God, it's got to be unmanageable.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.660]   Google has 56,000 employees at this point.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.980]   But it's a lot easier when--
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.500]   Is that right?
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.060]   The thing about Google is, it's like you're running Yale.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.860]   Everybody wants to work at Google.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.060]   So they have the pick of brilliance.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.260]   They have to weed through a lot.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.140]   But there have been jobs I've had over the years
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.340]   where I have to go scraping to find somebody willing to do
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.100]   the job at the pay we have, and so on and so forth.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.620]   It's Google's in a cap-board seat in that way.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.060]   But it changes all the time.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.140]   The other stories you hear are, it depends on the stock value
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.420]   and also what the perception of incoming college graduates
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.660]   is as to what's going to be the cool place.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.620]   And I would bet it's getting harder to get engineers
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   because the really best engineers are just
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.620]   to start their own company.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.460]   At this point, it's so easy to start a company that--
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.860]   while I think it's a good idea to at least go to work for a company
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.820]   for a few years and learn some stuff, I
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.220]   think a lot of people coming out of school
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.420]   saying, I've got to start up.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.260]   I'm going to do it myself.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:35.660]   Do you wish, Matt, that you had done that coming out of school?
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.180]   Well, that's kind of what I did, right?
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.620]   Because Google was under 100 people back then.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.260]   You went to work for a startup, yeah.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.500]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.820]   And it's true.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.220]   On one-- well, on one hand, you learn so much
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.620]   in such a short period of time.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.820]   And on the other hand, you really burn the candle at both ends.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.540]   Late nights, it's hard on your marriage.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.260]   You're working weekends.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.180]   And so you want to think hard about that trade off.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.900]   Apparently, still that way at Apple,
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.940]   we just saw another Apple employee leave and leave a long post
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.260]   about 16-hour days followed by meetings, meetings,
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.020]   meetings, weekends.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.900]   The lifestyle today, even though Apple's far from a startup,
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.060]   is just as brutal.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.580]   But people are willing to do it because they want to work
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.860]   at a company that's making a difference, I'm sure.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.340]   But you're right.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.980]   Not great for family life.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.820]   No.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.220]   It's the old Disney joke, too.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.780]   If you don't work on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:47.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.220]   OK.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.500]   Yeah, I remember coming in one weekend,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.340]   and I was like, wait, where'd everybody go?
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.860]   And I realized, oh, we were now at the point where people weren't
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.140]   always working on weekends.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.420]   That was a distinct culture.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.420]   Wow.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.980]   Wow.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.980]   Google, let's see what else is going on,
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.620]   appears to be developing a teleconferencing tool.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.580]   I like this idea.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.060]   In fact, I don't know-- it's really interesting.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.820]   When you see something like Mirkat,
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.860]   the first thought I think many of us had is, gosh, Google
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.300]   could have done this a year ago with Hangouts on Air and Hangouts
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.420]   and just didn't.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.340]   One of the hot areas, and we have a big advertiser go to meeting
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.540]   that does teleconferencing.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.220]   It's a hot area in business.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.540]   But this is such an obvious thing for Google to do,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.540]   especially for those of us who use Chromebooks.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.700]   We'd like Hangouts to be used this way.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:43.660]   So apparently, G-Meet-- this was a post on Google Plus--
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.460]   or Google Meetings will allow users to schedule and join
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.460]   teleconference calls with one click.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.500]   You've got Google Voice.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.700]   You've got Hangouts on it.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.060]   You've got everything you-- all the technologies you need.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:00.740]   Hangouts would be the base for the functionality.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.420]   Screenshots, though, also show an Android app
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.300]   and a Chrome extension, which would be very, very good news.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.580]   You know what I want to get rid of?
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.380]   Here's what I want to get rid of in conference calls.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.020]   Number one, music.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.980]   Number two, 40 digit codes as if they have a gazillion
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.620]   calls every day.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.180]   Number three, the voice says, we're
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.220]   checking to make sure that your number is valid.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.100]   You know it's a computer.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.020]   It doesn't do seconds.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.420]   Why is it taking them long to do it?
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.820]   And then number four, idiots.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.940]   If we get rid of those things, conference calls are fine.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.140]   This makes sense, though.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.580]   I mean, if you want people to use Chromebooks,
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.940]   I understand better now that I'm using the Pixel a lot.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.580]   You know, one of the strategies is
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.860]   to make sure you can do everything in HTML5
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.940]   and in browser.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.620]   And that's basically what Hangouts are, WebM and WebRTC
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.180]   and all of that, make sure that you can do a lot of this stuff
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.420]   now in the browser on Chrome OS.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.100]   Leo, what's the--
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.580]   Matt's in on Hangouts as I was for a long time as a loyal user.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.980]   Now Matt, if I don't know if you know,
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.940]   but they sent me a Mac.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.420]   I feel dirty, but I'm using a Mac.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.620]   Twitter has to buy him a Mac because we wanted him to use Skype.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.020]   Skype.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.740]   What's the technical difference between--
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.100]   what's the technological base between Skype and Hangouts?
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.180]   That Skype does have good quality.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:27.300]   The biggest difference is Skype uses a proprietary codec
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.020]   and that's been tuned over many years.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.340]   And I think in most cases, Skype's proprietary technology
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.780]   does a better job than the open technologies.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.420]   Hangouts uses video, V-I-D-Y-O, which is something that we tried.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.660]   You may remember we tried it.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.460]   Right, right.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.140]   And then many of the other tools use--
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.460]   is it Silk, Slick, and Brick?
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.620]   These are open source codecs.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.380]   And they're just, in my opinion, they're just not as robust,
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.380]   not as good.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:33:00.180]   Skype has been so highly tweaked to handle adverse environments.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.460]   And yet, when you throw enough bandwidth at it
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.180]   to give you amazing results, all you have to do
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.700]   is look at Alex Lindsey on Skype.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.260]   And you'll see what Skype's capable of,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.700]   which is essentially broadcast quality.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.020]   If you even the right camera and sufficient bandwidth,
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.180]   a computer that's powerful enough is not
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.700]   bogged down doing other things.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.180]   But at the same time, Skype handles,
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.300]   I think, adverse situations pretty well as well.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.100]   Is it still built on some version of a peer-to-peer structures?
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.940]   No, they--
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.700]   No, that's long gone.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.460]   The Microsoft acquired them.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.260]   Well, not long gone.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.100]   But a couple of years ago, Microsoft bought Skype.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.100]   And the first thing they did was shut down the SuperPiers
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.420]   and all of that stuff.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.500]   Super nodes that Skype was using.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.060]   So it's no longer peer-to-peer.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.780]   But Microsoft has servers galore, right?
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:47.100]   We are constantly looking at alternatives.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.780]   And I would love to use-- I want WebRTC to take off.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.980]   Because that would be so much easier.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.180]   And I would bet that this Google Meetings thing
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.260]   would be very much like it.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.180]   You could-- with a WebRTC, you can give somebody a URL
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.460]   and say, click this, that's it.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:01.900]   You're in.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.140]   Right.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:03.420]   Right.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.820]   That's awesome.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.700]   No numbers.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.460]   No numbers.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.900]   And WebRTC allows you to skin it so you can write your own WebRTC.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.020]   We could have a Twit client.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.180]   I mean, it's just--
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:14.940]   There's somebody--
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.380]   You can add chat to the side of it.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:16.940]   Well, kind of stuff.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.100]   Oh, yeah, you can do anything you want.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.020]   I'm sorry to force you to use a proprietary solution,
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.580]   because I'm in favor of a--
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.620]   I'm ashamed of myself every week.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.260]   But I have to say, we have to prioritize quality.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.260]   I don't.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:44.860]   Well, and it sounds like Hangouts can work with WebRTC.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.660]   But as you switch towards VP8 and VP9,
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.060]   I think YouTube just announced that they're starting to get VP9.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.540]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.340]   Over time, you know, you know, we'll get hardware support.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.260]   I think it'll get better.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.540]   There's no reason--
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.300]   I doubt that Skype's doing anything that
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:07.940]   can't be done as well as, if not better, by others,
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.700]   including open source, especially with Google's help.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:19.140]   VP9 gives you up to 4K quality using a lot less bandwidth.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.180]   And see, part of the problem is there
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.740]   is good to technology like H.264 out there,
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.740]   but it's owned by companies.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.940]   And there are limits as to what you can do.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.820]   We're even-- you know, Skype has certain restrictions
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.540]   that we worry about a lot.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:46.460]   So I would very much like an open solution.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.740]   I think we're using Skype in ways we're not supposed to.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.340]   I don't want to talk about that too much about it.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.620]   It seems like it's got it.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.140]   There is a Skype TX for broadcast.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.140]   Well, it seems like it's just getting better and better.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.420]   But it seems like it's getting better and better.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:06.460]   So here's a good-- this is from YouTube's engineering team
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:14.100]   comparing H.264 and VP9 with a 600 kilobit connection, which
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.780]   is a pretty low quality connection.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.420]   That's H.264.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.380]   This is a Janelle Monet video.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.180]   VP9 is a lot better than H.264.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.980]   And if you look at the split, the one on the left
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.860]   is the high quality.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.980]   It's better, for sure.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:39.460]   I mean, it's still not perfect, but 600 kilobits
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.500]   is pretty low quality.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:48.820]   Percent of low definition watch time.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.980]   Low definition is 240p.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.540]   When's the last time you watched a 240p video on YouTube?
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.780]   It looks so horrible.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.780]   So bad.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.580]   And then of course, VP9, I'll give you a 4K,
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.980]   as I mentioned.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:03.860]   Chrome has it.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.620]   So part of the issue is-- and this was a big debate.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.900]   Still is, I guess, a raging debate in HTML5.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.220]   HTML5 doesn't really have a--
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.900]   Matt, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it has
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.220]   a standard codec yet.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.020]   So the debate is what should happen when you have a video tag?
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:18.460]   Oh, I could--
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.180]   Good question.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.420]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.860]   You know who would know is Kevin Marks.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.660]   He's probably foaming at the mouth right now.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.860]   I want to talk.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.900]   We use FFM Pig, and FFM Pig does support VP9,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:41.140]   so we could do it if we wanted to.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.660]   We put all our stuff as MPEG-4.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.100]   I think that looks the best right now still.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.220]   Let's see.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.740]   Oh, we talked about it on security now, big story.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:57.260]   Google had a little run-in with China-NIC, the China Internet
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.540]   Network Information Center.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.260]   That's the certificate authority that
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.660]   does certificates out of China.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.060]   And just a little background, if you're not a security now,
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.580]   listen to this might be a little more complicated,
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.980]   but a little background.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.140]   In order to preserve the chain of trust
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.100]   when you use a secure website, the certificate issued
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.860]   by the secured website has to originate
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:25.420]   from a certificate authority that
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.140]   is recognized by the browser you're using.
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.740]   So all internet browsers come with a collection
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.900]   of certificate authorities.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:39.420]   Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Google's Chrome
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.540]   all pretty much use the same batch, I think.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.900]   It's not part of the operating system.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.500]   It's part of the browser.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:50.860]   But a short while ago, Google, which
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.940]   has a lot of instrumentation on the internet, as you might
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.380]   imagine, noted that somebody had issued a certificate
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.660]   for Google inappropriately.
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.980]   They tracked it back to China-NIC.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:08.420]   And what China-NIC had done is issued a certificate that
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.060]   allowed the holder to make other certificates.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.820]   The certificate was issued to a company
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.940]   that promised only to make certificates
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.140]   for its own internal use.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.860]   But apparently, these wild card certificates
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.820]   were somehow released into the world.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.780]   And these Egypt-based MCS holdings, which
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.980]   is an intermediate CA, was basically allowing a man
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.580]   in the middle attacks.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.020]   So Google, Adam Langley over at Google,
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.180]   who's the guy for all of this stuff, investigated.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.980]   And Google has decided to eliminate China-NIC
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.820]   from its pool of trusted certificate authorities.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.820]   That's a big deal.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:02.540]   And Firefox is doing it, too.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.420]   And it used to be the case.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.220]   I would really be paying a lot of attention to this
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.100]   and really stressed out.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.780]   And now I can read it about it with enough distance
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.380]   to find it kind of hilarious.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.860]   But I loved the quote from Mozilla,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.340]   where they basically said, the behavior
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.900]   and issuing an unconstrained intermediate certificate
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.540]   to a company with no documented PKI practices
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.780]   and with no oversight of how the private key was stored
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.820]   or controlled was an egregious practice.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.060]   So they're just like, OK, this qualifies as egregious practice.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.380]   We're going to drop C-N-NIC.
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.620]   Yeah, this is absolutely the way to do it.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.980]   You'll normally read people saying stuff like that.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.380]   China-NIC has responded, the decision
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.180]   that Google has made is unacceptable and unintelligible
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.700]   to C-N-NIC.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.700]   Meanwhile, C-N-NIC sincerely urged
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.700]   that Google would take users' rights and interests
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.180]   into full consideration.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.220]   I think Google did.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.100]   For the users that C-N-NIC has already issued the certificates
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.940]   to, we guarantee that your lawful rights and interests
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.580]   will not be affected.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.820]   Well, that's not exactly true.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.620]   Because if you go to a site with a CA authority that goes up
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.860]   to the chain to C-N-NIC, you will not
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.020]   be able to visit that site in Firefox or Chrome
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.100]   once those are updated.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.100]   Microsoft says we're still investigating.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.540]   No word from the other browser manufacturers, opera,
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.820]   and Safari.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.820]   But I imagine they'll do the same.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.540]   That's a big problem.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:35.220]   And Chrome is, by the way, the number one browser in China--
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.260]   52% market share, 23% for an internet explorer.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.700]   So it's a big deal in China.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.980]   If all of a sudden the number one browser
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.100]   doesn't recognize any C-N-NIC authority.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.780]   Wow.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.780]   It's a big deal.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.620]   If you're a C-N-NIC certificate holder,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.860]   that's a big deal for you.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.360]   Yep.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.420]   What does C-N-NIC have to do with your experience?
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.940]   You can do this thing called public--
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:08.100]   sounds like they'll need to put better controls in place.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.420]   But I love that Chrome uses something called public key
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.940]   pinning, which basically is able to spot whenever somebody tries
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.780]   to do a man in the middle attack without the proper authorization.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.340]   It was-- yeah, and Steve explains all how that worked
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.700]   and all of that.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.700]   It is great, because Google knows almost immediately
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.380]   when this man in the middle stuff starts to happen.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:27.900]   It said, wait a minute.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.340]   This is not our certificate, even though it says it is.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.420]   Google's in talk with mobile operators.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.780]   Where is this Google wireless that we
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.580]   keep hearing about this new wireless company?
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.420]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.300]   I know. Well, I'll have to go back to the Nexus 6.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.780]   I'm fantasizing that we all get SIMS at I/O.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.220]   Oh.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.940]   You think they'll wait till June to--
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.540]   when is it I/O?
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.740]   And in May, right?
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.740]   In May.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.140]   Because the latest is that they're
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.900]   doing deals with foreign international companies as well,
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.460]   which would just be wonderful.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.860]   So you'll also get cheap international calls
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:15.220]   and be able to use your phone abroad at no extra cost.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.900]   That would transform the industry.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.420]   Yep.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:18.920]   Huge.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:25.460]   So we know a word yet about this.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.540]   I had a reason.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.700]   I popped my SIM card out.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.620]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.540]   It was terrified.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.860]   So something like this would be really neat.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.540]   Yeah, I mean, we use T-Mobile.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.180]   And so you get 2G free everywhere.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.300]   But there's always-- phone calls are still very expensive.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.460]   It's just nervousness going on.
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.900]   But again, it's a case where the business doesn't operate
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.220]   properly and as with Google Fiber and as with phones.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:53.700]   I love it.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.620]   And Android, they can just--
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.220]   It's what the screws do.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.940]   --show the way.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:56.860]   It's true for them.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.580]   Just for once, think for the customer.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:06.020]   Say goodbye to Google Moderator shutting down July 31.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.620]   Do you know people that used it?
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.980]   This was a kind of cool idea.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.020]   It's like that old--
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.420]   I think I've said this in the show before.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.820]   It was that old Nick Game Show question.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.740]   Is it dead or Canadian?
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.180]   I had no idea Moderator was still alive.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.380]   It must be a Canadian app.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.260]   I don't know.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.940]   During the election, or actually after the election,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:34.380]   the Obama transition team used Moderator to get input.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.700]   And I have some ad covering up this Venture Beat article.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.780]   Go ahead.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:41.980]   Wow.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.700]   That's good.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.420]   It's an ad for Venture Beat.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.100]   Preventing me from reading Venture Beat.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.180]   This is worse than a paywall.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.660]   It is.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.580]   They had-- they took questions from the public.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.460]   The first series ran for 48 hours,
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.660]   got a million votes from 20,000 people on 10,000 questions.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.500]   That's the power of Google Moderator.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.140]   But I guess we should have used it for some things.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.860]   But we never did.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.940]   We've allowed user submitted questions, suggestions,
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.540]   and ideas.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.060]   You could then rank them and take feedback
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.900]   from a large number of people, not only on their own questions,
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.940]   but on others questions.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.700]   It's a good idea.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.980]   But I guess not enough people used it.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.620]   If you were using Google Moderator,
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.380]   you can't get your data from Google Takeout, of course.
[00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.540]   And you can continue to try using Google Moderator
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.140]   right up to July 30.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.180]   I'm June 30.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.420]   And then they're going to have a month of read-only.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.260]   And then they're going to shut it down.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.740]   Do people at Google sometimes kind of cringe
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.180]   when stuff shut down?
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.300]   I think everybody understands stuff has to be shut down.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.300]   But it's always a little painful for some people.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.860]   I think there's a little bit of a cringe reaction,
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.540]   because sometimes we actually use Moderator
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.780]   for weekly TGF kind of meetings so that people
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.620]   can grill the founders.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.620]   And I've used it for webmaster videos.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.900]   People can vote up the questions that you want to hear.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.260]   But yeah, you do have to kind of earn your pixels.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.500]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.660]   But it does make sense.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.860]   And I think it's been around long enough
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.780]   that people are like, OK, nobody's
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.820]   like super crazy attached to it.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.060]   And they understand it's got to earn its usage.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.180]   And so there's probably other tools
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.140]   that you can use at this point.
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.100]   So I know I didn't see this post.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:43.300]   But according to QZ, Eric Schmidt posted in January
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.660]   on Project Syndicate the story of how Google Image Search
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.460]   was created.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.700]   He writes, "Our founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin,
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.420]   like all other successful inventors,
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.220]   kept iterating.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.260]   They started with images.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.900]   After all, people wanted more than just text.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:05.060]   This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:08.740]   When Jennifer Lopez, JLo, wore a green dress that well
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.980]   caught the world's attention.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.380]   At the time it was the most popular search query
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.900]   we'd ever seen.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.340]   But remember, they don't have image search yet.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.180]   No surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted,
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.180]   which was a picture of JLo in the dress.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.220]   So Google Image Search was born.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.060]   At the time of its launch in 2001,
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.740]   the site offered 250 million images by 2010, 10 billion
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.780]   images.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:39.140]   And of course, QZ knowing the value of this
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.580]   has made sure that that picture and many more of JLo
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.260]   are right there on its front page.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:49.860]   JLo knows how to get attention, and Google
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.620]   knows how to help you find it.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.460]   Wow.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.940]   I think-- is that going to make this show not safe for work?
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.740]   No.
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.240]   No.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.640]   Would you imagine that moment?
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.040]   I mean, that's the kind of great Google--
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.080]   Oh crap, we don't search for images.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.000]   Let's go build it.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Right.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.160]   And it has to survive.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   Sorry about that.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.800]   Matt's a little late.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.520]   No, it's true.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.880]   I mean, we want to help people find what they want to find.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.400]   Right.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.520]   Even if it's JLo's dress.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.920]   Yep, sorry about the lag.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.880]   That's OK.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.320]   Well, just sorry to be interrupting,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.240]   but it's unintentional.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.920]   We have to learn to be patient.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.480]   Yes.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.560]   Oh, that's-- I can't do that.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:40.760]   Google has a patent for a cow avoidance mechanism
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.280]   in their self-driving cars.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:50.720]   This is the patent that actually involves a diagram
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.240]   of bovines, both full-grown in calves, and a car.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.120]   I have a vision that some Googlers get patents just for the--
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.600]   Just for the donlies.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.400]   You think this is just for the lols?
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   Cow avoidance patent.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.920]   Out of the damn patent office could actually patent that.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   Actually, when we were in Hawaii driving the Hana Highway,
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.480]   there was a bull occupying the road
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.600]   and very leisurely paced walking down the road.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.400]   And as much as we'd beeper, yell, he just--
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.680]   he led us down the road at about a mile an hour.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:34.680]   So cow avoidance can be an issue in some circumstances.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.200]   The trick is to develop a system that
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.320]   can tell when you're stuck behind an immovable object,
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.480]   or when you're just in bad traffic or in a parking lot.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.000]   So you needed to take not only that there's
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   an obstacle in the road, but how long it's been there.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.920]   How long you've been there, too.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.520]   This is from popular science.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.880]   Maybe it gets a heartbeat from a body temperature.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.840]   Oh, you could.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.440]   I don't know.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.920]   Do they have a UV sensor?
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.760]   Probably do.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.880]   You should.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.360]   I read the story about the other car
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.640]   that made it all the way across the country.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.120]   And of course, you'll appreciate this.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.400]   I freaked out.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.080]   Kind of because I said, oh, we're going
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.320]   onto a bridge in Philadelphia.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.000]   It's all metal.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.160]   That confuses the car.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.640]   I thought that was funny.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   I didn't think of you, though.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.360]   So that was the only kind of scary moment in this self-driving
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.640]   car that went all across the United States.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:38.120]   It was from a car-- a company that does car accessories.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.000]   But the-- and of course, they had as with most of the Google
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.120]   cars, there it is.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.560]   Is that it?
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.000]   Yep.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.840]   Once we get past the takeover.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.240]   What's the name of it?
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:50.840]   Delphi.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.360]   Delphi.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.400]   That's right.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.280]   And they did-- there were a few moments.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.680]   But for the most part, the car went the whole way
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.200]   on regular roads.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.640]   These cars are getting so good.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.600]   I feel like we're close.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:09.680]   And as you say, the most difficult or most scary thing
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.400]   for the engineers was this metal bridge,
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:19.040]   because they knew that the metal would likely throw the radar.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.840]   Didn't they?
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.440]   They just hovered their hands over the wheel.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.960]   That's pretty cool.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.320]   How many miles did they-- it was an Audi Q5 that was modified.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.160]   What's cool is it looks pretty normal.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:35.400]   Most of the LiDAR and the radar and the self-driving sensors
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.680]   were hidden behind plastic panels.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.240]   In the car went 3,400 miles, 99% of the time
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:47.080]   in autonomous mode, nine days, 15 states.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.280]   The team collected three terabytes of data during the drive.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.680]   I think it's great that it's not just Google that's
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.200]   doing this.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.760]   I think you want-- this is when you get critical mass.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.040]   And I'm sure people are sharing--
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.400]   I hope people are sharing their information and so forth.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   Of course, Audi did this.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   They drove from San Francisco to CES.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.600]   Mercedes has done this as well.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.720]   Now, the thing I wondered was I didn't think
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.600]   that self-driving cars were legal in all those states.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.920]   They were increasingly legal for research purposes.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.560]   But I bet you that's why I took them nine days.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.800]   They said they took a southern route because of snow.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.040]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   It's pretty cool.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.600]   I think we might see them in our lifetime, Jeff.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.360]   You know?
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:36.960]   That'd be amazing.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.240]   I think Matt'll be driving one home before you know it.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.480]   They're going to say, hey, cut.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.720]   If we send you a self-driving car,
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.560]   will you come back to work?
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.240]   Are you bored yet, Matt?
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:49.760]   It's going to be the best.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.480]   Any self-driving cars they have.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.760]   I'm not bored yet.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.280]   No.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:54.960]   Good.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.000]   Been nice spending time with my wife, so.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:58.400]   You know what?
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.480]   I played with the other day, and we really enjoyed it.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.200]   We had the whole team doing it.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.000]   I should show you our--
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.040]   Oh, these were great pictures, yeah.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.600]   --Google+ story.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.560]   We got Segways, which I know sound like an old hat.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.640]   They're still kind of mind-boggling technology.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.560]   And we had so much fun doing them.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.120]   Let me see if I can find you the--
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.480]   No, it wasn't-- no, no, no, no, awesome.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:28.120]   It was a story of our trip through San Francisco's streets
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.040]   on Segways.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.560]   There's Father Robert, Brian.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.800]   Well, this is why Segways didn't take off.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.320]   Let's face it, you look like a dork.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.680]   But it was so fun that I have to say,
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.920]   I feel like-- by the way, this is completely
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.040]   automated, this Google story.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.480]   They did such a good job.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.680]   We had, I think, six Segways.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.400]   There's our producer, Carsten Bondi.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   It was so much fun.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.520]   This was actually cool, because I was able to get--
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.600]   a Segway makes an excellent dolly for video shots.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.120]   Right.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.480]   Look how smooth the--
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.560]   I was just holding a camera phone.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.280]   It's really kind of fun.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.240]   Wait a minute, we detected your video can be enhanced.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.720]   So we're going to fix this video.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.920]   Thank you, Google.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.840]   Thank you.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.920]   They are really fun.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.400]   And then Robert, of course, is the quadfather.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.400]   So he brought his drones and flew them probably illegally.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.080]   Illegally?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.040]   Probably, but near that thing you hate so much
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.040]   that I won't use the B word.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.680]   My palms were sweating.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.600]   No.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.680]   You look at the Golden Gate-- oh, and there's birds saying.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.160]   Mine.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.520]   Mine.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:48.960]   I love that.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.040]   Google even made it black and white, so that's cool.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.800]   I should share this.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.960]   But this was so much fun.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.520]   And you know what's interesting?
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.320]   Once you ride these, you realize that it's hard not
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.320]   to personify these.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.640]   I bet this is the same thing with autonomous vehicles.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   You start to feel like you're riding a horse or something.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.160]   And it kind of--
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.560]   for after half an hour in a segue,
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.120]   you really feel like you just think where you want to go
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.840]   and you go there.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.760]   It completely becomes internalized.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.320]   I'm this close to buying one.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.760]   Talk me out of it, Jeff.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.840]   Oh, god, no.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.440]   Leo, no.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.840]   No.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.240]   So you're going to drive it back and forth from home to work,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.480]   which does sound practical, but you're
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.560]   going to feel like such--
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.600]   I geek.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.200]   You know who looks like a geek?
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.880]   Mike Elgin, because he's wearing a suit
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.480]   on a segue with Google Glass.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.680]   That's beyond.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.320]   That's the height.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.480]   Tourists were taking pictures of him.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.600]   See, it's true.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.520]   They do do this in San Francisco.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.760]   He must work for Google.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.880]   It must be a Googler.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.120]   So I like the other patent there, Leo.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.200]   This is the first one.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.320]   Spoiler avoidance?
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:14.760]   Yes.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.840]   We need to patent that, because apparently it's
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.680]   the worst thing we can do to spoil TV shows for our audience.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.240]   A spoiler is on social media.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:28.560]   This is also from QZ.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.200]   This is an April Fool's joke.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:31.640]   Can't be real.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.160]   April 7th.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.400]   I hate April Fool.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.960]   So the thing about it is there is some logic to it, right?
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.000]   Viewing progress.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.800]   So if it knows where you are and watching a show,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.400]   it can then help you avoid spoilers, which only
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.640]   gives Google yet more data about you.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.880]   Aha, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.760]   We know you are three seasons into the good wife.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.960]   Method comprising receiving activity data, describing activity
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.880]   performed by a first user, determining a first progress
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.200]   stage for subject associated with the activity base, at least
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.960]   a part on the activity data.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.440]   Oh my god.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:04.720]   Right.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.960]   These days must be torture.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.560]   They have people to do that.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.000]   I know.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.920]   That's a long--
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.960]   Holy cow, look at this.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.360]   This is the patent application.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.840]   Where's the figures?
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.440]   I guess we got-- oh, here's the images.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:21.960]   Yeah, I want a little stick figure jumping up and down,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.520]   saying, no, you spoiled it.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.240]   Does Google have a Pittsburgh office?
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.440]   These two guys are in Pittsburgh.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.320]   It's so--
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.840]   I think we do have a Pittsburgh.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.800]   All right.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:38.040]   Content may include a-- so the idea would be the message comes
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.560]   up on Google+, or whatever, but is hidden or truncated.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.600]   And then there's a pop-up that says,
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.120]   content may include a spoiler.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.240]   Do you want to read it now?
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.080]   And then you can click to show the full message.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.880]   That's wild.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.240]   Can you do it to podcasts, though?
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.240]   I could use--
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.400]   I could use that on--
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.600]   I had a Google Now card.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.120]   I was watching the NCAA.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:04.480]   Yes.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.200]   And I'm a Kentucky fan, which didn't learn.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.800]   So it was-- it was hopefully showing me the scores live
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.640]   for the Kentucky game.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.240]   And I was trying--
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.560]   I was like, don't look at my phone,
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.360]   because it'll tell me who's winning.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.080]   And so I could use a spoiler that avoidance just
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.040]   for my own phone.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.400]   So--
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.560]   So sorry.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.920]   I'm so sorry.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.480]   So we know what Andy Rubin's doing after his hiatus.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.160]   I guess he's left Google.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.600]   He left Android and then was working
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.880]   for the Google X folks, right?
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.000]   We thought maybe doing robots.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.120]   Turns out he's become an investor.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.000]   He's launched an incubator call--
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.800]   I guess it's an incubator called Playground Global.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   And it's to support--
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.200]   to provide support advice to tech startups, particularly
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.360]   making hardware.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.240]   That is actually a great area, because that's a--
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.640]   it's well known how to do software startups.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.240]   But a hardware startup is an entirely different collection
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:06.680]   of challenges, including having to go to China and all that.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.280]   Of course, Andy Rubin before he was at Google
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.200]   did Danger and the Sidekick and certainly a lot of experience
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.880]   being a hardware-- working in hardware systems.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.560]   So he gives advice for equity, which makes perfect sense to me.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.720]   The only thing I don't understand here
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.200]   is why he then needed to raise $48 million.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.000]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.840]   I mean, I understand why I'd love to invest in.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.040]   I'd love to have a piece of it.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.640]   I'm like, so--
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.840]   it sounds like some of the investors were strategic.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.040]   So Foxconn, it sounds like, is one of the investors.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.880]   And that's also a company that does a lot of manufacturing.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.440]   So there might be some synergy going on.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:41.960]   Right.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:47.080]   HP, Google, Hanhai Precision Industry, all investing.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:53.320]   And Red Point, of course, which is a venture capital firm that
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.240]   has a past history of investing in Andy Rubin.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.360]   Tencent Holdings, Seagate.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.160]   Interesting.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:09.320]   I like the idea that he was going to go work on robots.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.000]   But maybe he'll still get to work on robots.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.640]   He says his quote is, I will have--
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.440]   I thought the other interesting story about--
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.320]   Why this lag is killing us, I'm sorry.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.880]   The other-- just once you start talking, just keep going.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.600]   You'll just keep going.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.240]   Yeah, there's a story about a Google--
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.320]   OK.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.200]   I will do.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.480]   The other interesting story I thought about a Google alumni
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.720]   alumnus, alumnae, alumna--
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.520]   I'll just say them all.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.040]   And then we can--
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.560]   Alumna is the correct.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.640]   Is Stephanie Hannon, who it sounds like--
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.520]   yes, so alumna, because it's one female person.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.640]   So Stephanie Hannon is--
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.880]   sounds like, according to The Washington Post,
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.360]   going to leave google.org, work for Hillary Clinton
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.840]   as her CTO, kind of like Harper Reid did for Obama.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.080]   And I have to say, Stephanie is a fantastic Googler.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.400]   She'll be really missed.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.640]   Or I don't know if she's going on leave, maybe.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.440]   But she's helped with everything from helping
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.760]   you find your voting location to--
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.240]   Google.org does stuff like Ebola One boxes
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.480]   and all these really useful interesting things.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.080]   And so I'm really excited to see what she does over
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.280]   at the Clinton campaign.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.160]   Washington Post says, Stephanie Hannon
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.760]   is Google's Director of Product Management
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.680]   for Civic Innovation and Social Impact.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.120]   She will serve on the senior staff for Clinton's campaign
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.440]   and oversee a team of engineers and developers, which
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.800]   could include outside consultants
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   to devise websites, apps, and other tools
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.520]   for this former Secretary of State and her staff
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.800]   to engage with supporters and voters.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.120]   Yeah, Harper Reid did so much good for President Obama
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.000]   in the campaign.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.920]   This is now something you cannot do without.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.840]   Yeah, and I love that there's Googlers who are civic minded
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.760]   and are interested in government.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.600]   And so there's a well of people like Mikey Dee, who
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.560]   went to help with healthcare.gov.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.880]   And so you can imagine going off from Google
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.120]   and doing startups or investing.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.360]   But I like that there's this new path opening up
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.400]   if you want to help with US digital service or 18
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.680]   effort or government service in general,
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.000]   because there's a lot of good things that could be done there.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.520]   Well, we need it.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.840]   Yep.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.880]   We desperately need it.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.440]   Let's see.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.320]   A couple of-- we don't have a change log per se,
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.920]   but a couple of features.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.960]   Google Calendar 5.2, which isn't yet on the Google Store,
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.880]   you can do a sideload, brings back the month view on phones.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.960]   Apparently, people really missed it.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.800]   I missed it.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.400]   Did you?
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.120]   Even though everything is so condensed and compact and everything,
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.240]   it's still useful to be able to glance at and go,
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.600]   that's the layout.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.080]   I don't know.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.120]   I found myself wanting it many times.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.240]   I'm happy to have it.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.400]   I just pretty much always use the agenda, the list,
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.320]   because anything else I just can't see it on a small screen.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.240]   Anyway, the angle here, the article,
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.440]   I'm sorry here from Android Police,
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.160]   has an APK that you could download.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   I would wait.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.520]   There it is.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.440]   You couldn't wait.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.960]   You know, no, I can't wait.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.680]   I saw a month view.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.160]   I saw a month view.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.000]   I saw a month view, and I was like, sold.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.880]   Wow.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.520]   But yeah, so it's all jam-packed in there,
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.440]   but it's still usable.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.160]   I mean, I totally find this useful.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.200]   I use it to kind of look at the-- to find out
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.880]   what day April 2030 is, things like that, I guess.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.120]   Well, you can get it if you want.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.440]   Android Police has the link, although if I were you,
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.280]   I'd wait for the update.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.880]   And Google Vault--
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.000]   What are you laughing at?
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.240]   What is-- I don't even know what Google LAP Vault is.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.960]   In general, it's a good rule of thumb to--
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.520]   Huh.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.960]   That might be the archiving for enterprise to make sure
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.120]   that you save things for legal discovery.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.880]   Ah!
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.400]   They should call it your sock vault, your sock's vault,
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.800]   to now cover his hangouts for work chat.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.000]   So you can keep your organization's chat history
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.360]   in the vault.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.040]   And when the feds come calling, you'll have a copy of it.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:42.920]   That's something only enterprise cares about.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.160]   Android Wear now has more than 1,000 different watch faces.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.080]   Boy, as the Apple Watch comes out on Friday,
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.000]   there's, of course, a lot of attention on Apple.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.080]   But I got to say, Android Wear has such an amazing ecosystem.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.840]   You know, I just-- I really love my Moto 360,
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.880]   and that's going to be tough for me
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.600]   to give up my Android phone and my Moto 360,
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.480]   because I'm going to have to-- starting on the 24th of this
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.240]   month.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240]   Do a watch.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.040]   When can you order?
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.280]   Can order Friday at midnight.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.200]   Is there--
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.160]   You really believe they'll get rid of the lines?
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.320]   You know, that's one of the things--
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.000]   we talked about this yesterday on MacBreak Weekly.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   Angela Arrence, the new president of Retail,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.160]   head of Retail at Apple, has decided,
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.000]   and I think rightly so, to encourage staff, all the folks
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.440]   at the Apple Store, to tell their customers,
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.080]   don't try to buy it here.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.400]   Order online.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.320]   We'll get it to you.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.200]   The lines are great marketing for Apple,
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.040]   but they've-- and we talked about this yesterday.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.800]   They've really become kind of not a great experience.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.040]   They've been fights in Apple stores.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.800]   The lines are filled with homeless people and riff-raff.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.200]   I think the roof-raff, the lines.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.280]   People being-- people who are not Apple fans,
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.800]   but are being paid to buy stuff, or do we at least hold
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.040]   a place in line, or to buy stuff to ship overseas.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.920]   And so it's just not the wonderful experience it used to be.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.720]   I think the employees loved it because it was exciting.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.440]   You applaud.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.280]   There's a countdown.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.360]   Over time.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.320]   Over time.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.160]   Yeah, they work all night.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.040]   But the experience of buying the watch
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   is going to be so very different, I think.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.480]   You have to make 15-minute appointments.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.080]   They have a special table.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.200]   You cannot touch the watches.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.320]   They're under glass.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.560]   They're sealed.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.160]   And unless you have an appointment with an Apple employee
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.360]   who has then this card, they can swipe the table
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.960]   and a magic drawer appears and they pull the watches out.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.720]   And they stand there watching you while you try them on
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:49.640]   and help advise you and encourage you to upgrade your iPhone.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   I think that this is a very different experience.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.960]   And so they're telling people, Angela
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.200]   says, this is a new mindset for us because--
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.320]   remember, it wasn't so long ago.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.920]   Maybe less than a year ago, that Tim Cook said,
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.680]   we want to get people back in the Apple stores
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.800]   buying their phones.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.720]   They didn't like it that the phones
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.520]   were being sold by the cell phone companies
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.600]   and not in the Apple store.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.840]   But now, I think they're backing off.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.080]   But look at this.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:12.560]   I love this.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.800]   This is an Android mosaic with 1,000 Android wear faces.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.080]   Most of them are horrible.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.240]   Let's face it.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.160]   What's your face now?
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.560]   I use a program called Facer, Android programs
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.080]   in the store called Facer.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.600]   And then there are big repositories of Facer.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.760]   You can make your own, of course.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.840]   But then people have made their own,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.400]   and they've uploaded them to the Facer repos.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   And so there's some beautiful, I think,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.920]   really nice watch faces.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.520]   You can now, in your watches-- and Apple's
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.840]   going to do this, of course, much more elegantly.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.400]   Well, Apple's going to do two, typically Apple-ly things.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.480]   First of all, only Apple can make watch faces
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.600]   for the Apple watch.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.520]   And two, they have a very elegant way
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.600]   of adding what they call features to the watch.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.840]   They call them complications to the watch face.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.600]   So you pick a watch face, and then you spin the knob,
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.160]   and it adds different complications
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.680]   to different parts of the watch face and all of that stuff.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.880]   So you will be able to create a custom watch face.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.800]   You won't have this variety of bands, either.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.560]   The bands are nice.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.400]   They have some nice new bands.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.720]   Lots of nice new bands.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.480]   Of course, you'll have to buy your band from Apple,
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.600]   at least for the time being.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.520]   Well, that's what Google's all about, choice.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.320]   Android's all about choice.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.800]   Apple's all about a curated experience.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:30.000]   Matt, what do you wear?
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   How do you wear?
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   I wear, for the most part, a $30 Timex watch.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   But I'm still holding out hope for Android wear.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   So I'm not young enough that I don't wear a watch,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   but I'm holding out to see what's going to be the best watch for me.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   I'm going to flick it.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   I'm just going to-- I think we can go to the picks of the week
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   here in just a second.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Turkish government blocking Twitter, Facebook, and Google
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   over photos of an assassinated prosecutor.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   What I love about that story is that as soon as they block Twitter,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   Twitter users in Turkey know how to get around now.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   And so they make-- you know, something like blocked in Turkey,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   the trending hashtag.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   Google's last Christmas-- or maybe it was two Christmas
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   ago-- suffered a split in the past.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   Google has teamed up with NORAD to do the Santa Tracker every year.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.080]   Keep-- you know, because NORAD's got those early warning radar
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.360]   stations all over the world.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.560]   And so they can see, as Santa approaches each region of the world,
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.480]   NORAD started doing its own tracker.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.120]   Google has the Santa Tracker, which actually is a fun website.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.400]   In fact, there's a Santa Tracker watch face.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.400]   But they've decided to open source it.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.400]   I'm waiting for porn to come on that.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.400]   I'm not so sure.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.400]   So it's on GitHub, Google/Santa Tracker web,
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   and Google/Santa Tracker Android.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400]   So you know what?
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   If nothing else, this is a great opportunity to look at the source code
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   and see how Google does an Android app and a web app.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.400]   I think that's super cool.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   And of course, you can customize it.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   That is nice.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400]   When a company does something like that, it just says,
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   "You know, we're going to put the source out."
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.400]   Very rare.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.400]   I think partly because programmers realize how ugly their source code is,
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.400]   and they don't want to clean it up.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.400]   But the Santa Tracker on the web was built using a library
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.400]   from the Chrome team called Polymer.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.400]   You may remember that from Google.io.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.400]   I think they talked about it last year.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.400]   So it's, in a way, it's an ad for Google development technologies.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:57.400]   And the Santa Tracker for Android, I said, using Polymer.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   No, I don't know.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   And they have all these cool components and stuff.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   So it's actually really a good idea to open source this,
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:10.400]   but it don't get up and let people download it and look at it.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   And the software engineer in charge,
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   Enker Kottwe says, or Kottweil says,
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.400]   "He hopes developers are inspired to make their own magical experiences."
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.400]   What else could you do?
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   You could have an Easter Bunny Tracker.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400]   Exactly.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.400]   Did you do the Easter egg hunt and all of that?
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400]   No.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400]   I just remember.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   No.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   You know, you're getting old when you buy yourself your own candy for--
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   That's sad.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   That's sad.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400]   No, we don't need a break.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.400]   We're going to go right through.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   I see you.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   Do you ever win a minute?
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   Jason Howell is pulling the microphone.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   No, well.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.400]   I was just going to confirm.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   There is no break.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.400]   No break.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   The show goes on.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.400]   The show goes on with our traditional tool number.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.400]   And Matt, I'll let you do a thing of the week.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   Let me just show you my new tool.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   You're going to be a little jealous.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:25.400]   The Galaxy S6 from Samsung came yesterday.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   And I'm kind of liking it.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   This is the edge.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   This is the one with the curvy edges on both sides.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.400]   They've somehow figured out how to take a screw--
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   Because this is all one screen and just bend it around.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400]   And in fact, the screen does go around the edge.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.400]   You can see the edges.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   The edge is they use the edge not as much as they did.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400]   Oh, by the way, one of the things I really like.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.400]   They've got a fingerprint reader that doesn't require a swipe.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.400]   It's very much like the Apple fingerprint reader.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   It works really well.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   It's very fast and snappy.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:59.400]   It's got Samsung's own X10O 8-core processor in it.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   And by the way, that means they've got a glass back.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   And that means no removable battery anymore, no SD card.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   But it does come in big memory variants.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.400]   There's 128 gig versions.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   And I've got the 64.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   The 64 gigs is enough for me.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   People are raving about the camera.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.400]   And I have to say so far, and I've only had it a day.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400]   I've been getting great pictures.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   I'm not sure about battery life, though.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.400]   I'm a little worried.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:25.400]   What I've been told is that Google-- I'm sorry.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   Samsung is using-- it's an 8-core, but it's really effectively dual
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   quad-core processors.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   One running at a slower clock rate, one at a faster.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   Unless you need it, it doesn't kick in that second processor.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.400]   But if it does kick it in, this is going to get hot,
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]   and it does get hot when I was downloading all the stuff to set it up.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.400]   It started getting not burning hot, but pretty warm.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.400]   And it just clobbers battery life.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   And I'm a little nervous about battery life, but again, I haven't had it long enough to know.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   It's one of those things that's so beautiful that you play with it a lot at first.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.400]   How's the Samsung Croft?
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400]   It's craftable.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.400]   It's crafty.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   In fact, let me change the-- it's crafted.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   Definitely heavily crafted.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   Croft delicious.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   Let me change the home-- I use a Nova launcher, which I really like.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.400]   Where do I change the other applications?
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   Let me change the home launcher to TouchWiz, which is, of course, Samsung's own launcher,
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   and show you.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   I don't know that woman.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.400]   She's just strange wallpaper.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.400]   I don't know why it's there.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   That's not Samsung's wallpaper.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   They do have themes on this.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   It's got a lot of-- this is from T-Mobile.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   It's got some T-Mobile stuff.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   It's got a lot of Samsung-y stuff, although I don't find it offensive.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:01.400]   It also has-- this is like, you know, the Google Now launcher is swiped to the right.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.400]   You get Google Now on HTC Sense.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   You get Blink while Samsung's doing that now, too, only a special version of Flipboard,
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   which actually is pretty nice.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   And it also demonstrates how fast the processor is because I can scroll this puppy like nobody's business.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:25.400]   And once you start reading stuff, it does a lot of-- you see those little special effects and things like that.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.400]   I'm actually kind of fond of it.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   This phone is 577 dots per inch, which is crazy.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   Crazy.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.400]   Wow.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400]   It looks like a sticker.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   It looks like a poster.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]   It looks so good.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.400]   I mean, just-- I'm using a-- I love this.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:53.400]   The 500 PX wallpaper app, so I just pull in at random new wallpaper every 30 minutes.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   The camera is, I think, going to be the real selling point on this.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   They've made it-- if you're used to the Samsung cameras, they've made it a little more subtle.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   You know, they used to have these big pictures and stuff.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   Now, it's just very simple.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   The different kinds of cameras.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   They've cleaned it up a little bit.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   It's lollipop.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.400]   It's Android 5.02.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   But you don't see-- I mean, it's, you know, this bugs the heck out of me.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   S finder and quick connect.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   You can't-- I don't know why when you do that pull down to get notifications.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   You can't get rid of that.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.400]   It drives me crazy.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   I don't even know what they do, and I don't want to use them.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   But it takes up all that real estate.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   On the other hand, I love the quick launcher, and you can customize that, you know, and that's
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   kind of nice.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   It's just not-- it's not lollipop.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   If you want lollipop, though, besides the Nexus 6, I think the new Oxygen OS on the 1+ is very
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   cool.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   You're a lollipop.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   Both Jason and I have put it on our 1+1.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   Are you still using the 1+?
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   No, you went to the Nexus 6, didn't you?
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400]   Yeah, Nexus 6 is for my current jam.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   And you two, Jeff?
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   So you already have a nice, clean lollipop experience.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   Such a big phone, though.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   This is so elegant.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   So, eh...
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   I fix it, gave the S6 Edge a 3 out of 10 on repairability.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   You know, what--
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   You know, what--
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   For obvious reasons.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   Nowadays, who cares?
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   Right, did you--
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.400]   Okay, so your Nexus 6, which I'm sure is very repairable.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.400]   What did you do when the screen broke?
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   Well, yeah, no, the fair point.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   Did you repair it?
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]   Not myself.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   I'm not gonna do that.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   You got a--
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.400]   I got time for that.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.400]   I got a no-one.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400]   Exactly.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   I contacted Motorola, got a new one.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   I had to pay for it, but that's all right.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   So people do.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   My only concern at all, 'cause in every respect, this is the most elegant, beautiful.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   It just feels nice.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   It looks nice.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   It's snappy.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400]   It works well.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.400]   Gorgeous camera.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   It might be the best--
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400]   Arguably the best camera on the market.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   Certainly the best Android camera out.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   But the battery life could be a makered or breakred.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   But I'm really happy with this.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.400]   There is a fair bump for the--
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.400]   It's so thin, there's a fair sized bump for the camera on the back, but we're seeing that
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400]   more and more now.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.400]   Some people are wondering whether they should buy the edge or the regular.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   You don't get much extra functionality with the edge.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.400]   There is kind of a cool thing you do with the edge, which is if I slide it in, you can
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   assign colors to up to five people in your life.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:35.400]   And if you get a message or a call from them, and this is face down, it will glow with that
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   color to let you know that--
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   Whoop-de-doo-da.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.400]   Whoop-de-doo-da.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   There's a night mode which will show the time and weather and date on the side here on the
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   left or the right side.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   So since it does come with both Qi and PowerMat wireless charging, I have it in a little
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   wireless charging cradle.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.400]   So that's kind of nice.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.400]   I can look over and see the time.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   Not a big functional thing, frankly.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.400]   So I think it's more aesthetics.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.400]   I like the aesthetics of it.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.400]   It's so weird because we're used to curved backs and flat fronts that I frequent-- I have
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.400]   not yet conditioned myself to think-- to realize this is the back and that the curved thing
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   is actually the front.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.400]   But that's my tool of the week.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.400]   I'm actually pretty excited about it.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.400]   I'm enjoying-- this is the Samsung Galaxy S6.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   I bought it from T-Mobile.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:35.400]   But of course, I think all the companies are carrying it and we'll have it soon.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   Do you buy it unlocked?
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   Normally what I do is I don't buy it from it.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   This is the first one I bought years from a carrier.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.400]   That's why I'm asking.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.400]   Usually I just buy an unlocked version.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.400]   But what is happening with Samsung when you get an unlocked version on like Expansus or
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   somewhere is-- like my note for is the Hong Kong model.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.400]   So I thought, you know what?
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.400]   I should get a US model.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.400]   We'll just try it.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   And I'm a T-Mobile customer of all of them.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.400]   Team Level is my preferred carriers.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   Yeah, now there's a strange baby on the phone.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   I don't know.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   I love this wallpaper though.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   This is 500px wallpapers.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.400]   It's awesome.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   It's coach-roaded.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.400]   Isn't that cute?
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   You get to pick which categories and 500px you want and it changes it every-- whatever you
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.400]   want, five minutes hour.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400]   Really fast, really nice.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.400]   I'm a little nervous about battery.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.400]   I'll tell you what's-- the one way they've handled that, they does support fast charging.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:43.400]   I was able to charge the phone to 50% from 0 to 50% last night in half an hour and fully
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.400]   charged in under an hour.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   So that's one way to get around it.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.400]   But you need the fast charging capability.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   You cannot get that on a battery as far as I know.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400]   Not yet anyway.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   Jeff, you got a number?
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   Let's go with this one.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   So business inside are speculated, merely speculated, but what the hell?
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   It's what we do in journalism now.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   That if Apple does drop Google from its default search position, they then speculated that
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   Google would no longer have a split revenue with Apple.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   So they did some figuring and figured if 50% of the users stuck with Google, which would
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.400]   be I think a conservative estimate of how many would, Google actually earned $1.2 billion
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   in revenue by being dropped from Apple and dropping Apple's share.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   Wow.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   Oh, who knows what the truth of it is, but I found it interesting that the way the economics
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   could work in this case.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   I don't think that's true.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:43.900]   I don't believe that because the reason Google spends the money, $1.2 billion, and sends
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:49.400]   it to Apple is it's a-- I would guess a percentage of the money they make with those-- it's a--
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400]   Rep.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.400]   It says they get to keep that percentage.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.400]   They're losing whatever it is four or five times more than that in revenue.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:05.400]   It's like saying, oh, this is great.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   If I don't use a realtor, I will save a lot of money, but you don't also don't get to
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:13.400]   buy the house.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   Isn't that--
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   Man, help me out in the math here.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   Isn't the money that Google pays to Apple percentage of the overall traffic Apple brings
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.400]   to Google, the overall revenue?
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.400]   You could certainly do it that way, but imagine that Apple leaves Google, and now Google's
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   not paying that large amount of money, and now Google makes its case to all the users
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.400]   of Apple devices to Firefox users with Firefox switch to--
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   Wait, that's the point.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.400]   To change it back.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   If those users change it back, now we get to keep the money from all those ads without
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400]   paying anything down.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.400]   Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.400]   Yeah, but that's a big if.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.400]   Mathematics could be-- yeah.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.400]   That's a big if.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.400]   Remember, the tyranny of the default.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.400]   People never change their default search.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.400]   Google's Google, though.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.400]   I would change it.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.400]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400]   So that's the key.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.400]   It just depends.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:10.400]   I've chosen a lot of people on-- yeah.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.400]   And nobody's telling anybody the actual numbers, so we just have to--
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Of course it's just business insiders quickly.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.400]   There's no question, though, Google is making a point because when you do us--
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.400]   I can't remember when it comes up, but they do--
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.400]   When you do a Google search, they pop up.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   Oh, we noticed that you were not the default search in your browser.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.400]   Would you like to change that?
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   Right.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.400]   It's important to do that not so often.
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400]   You don't want to annoy users.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   But a lot of the times, if somebody's a Firefox user and all of a sudden they're searching
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.400]   on Yahoo and they don't know why, letting people know, hey, if you want to come back to
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   Google, here's a simple way to do it.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.400]   It might make it easier for them.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.400]   I guess the real question is how many people would notice the difference and hate Bing
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   and Yahoo so much that they say, oh, God, what's gone wrong, I need to get back to Google
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   search.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   They look a lot alike.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   I bet you half of the people don't notice it.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.400]   There's a reason--
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.400]   There's a reason Internet Explorer was the dominant browser for so long.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   I'm sure there's a--
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.400]   But I also think there's probably a lot of people at Apple and it being--
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.400]   And Yahoo and at Google who are doing all this analysis and trying to figure it out.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.040]   I think one benefit from Firefox switching to Yahoo, I like competition and I like diversity
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.400]   in the search space and that lets everybody try out different options.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.480]   But it also probably gives Google a little bit of insight about what percentage of people
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:34.400]   would switch back and all those sorts of things.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400]   Right.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   Having had that happen once now they know maybe how many people stick with the default, how
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   many people will switch back and then they can mix.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.400]   Then they have-- What it is is you need the information so you can negotiate a fair price
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   in future going forward.
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   Yep.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.400]   So I don't know if Business Insider knows any more than we do on this.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.400]   No, they don't.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.400]   They're just speculating.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.400]   But hey.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:02.400]   Well, there's some point where-- There's some percentage of people that will go back to
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.400]   Google that will make it worthwhile.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.400]   Yes.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:08.400]   We just don't know what that is.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:16.400]   Mr. Money Mustache, that cuts his pick of the week.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.400]   So at the top of the show we were talking a little bit about just trying to make great content
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   and you will succeed and not thinking that much about SEO.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.400]   And so I wanted to highlight a website that I've been just really enjoying the last few
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.400]   months or so called Mr. Money Mustache.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.400]   It's a Mr. Money Mustache.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.400]   And highlighting that a good name is very important.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   Yes, it's very brandable.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   And so he's basically a tech worker.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.400]   He's worked at tech companies.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   But he saved a ton of his money, a large percentage of his take-home money.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   And he's early retired.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400]   And so now he's got financial independence.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   He can do what he wants.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.400]   But he's got a whole philosophy.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.400]   And the philosophy is stuff like move closer to your work so that you can commute with
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   a bike instead of with a car or a second car and learn new hobbies like woodworking or plumbing
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   or working around the house to save you money.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.400]   And then that not only saves you money, but you also get good exercise.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.400]   So he's got a whole philosophy about you can take the money that you would use when you
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.400]   early retired and use that to make the world better.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:31.400]   And for anybody who's ever been like, oh, I should save more than 10% of my paycheck
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.400]   or anything like that.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   It's like a little bit of personal finance, but more about trying to emphasize all the
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   fun things you could do if you were to learn a few new skills or not just sit and watch
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.400]   TV every single hour of the night.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400]   I love this one, muscle over motor.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:55.400]   You know, if you just mow your own lawn, blow your own leaves, walk instead of ride a segue,
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.400]   you won't need that expensive gym membership.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.400]   I hated the truth.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400]   This is good.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:07.400]   So and what is the SEO lesson to be learned here?
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:14.400]   I think the SEO lesson is this is a guy who started in like 2011, 2012 and has built a
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.400]   very profitable sort of business on the side, although he's already financially independent.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   And all he's done is try to provide the best advice, no nonsense that he can.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.400]   And he's there's been a couple times where, you know, somebody has come to him as an
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.400]   advertiser and said, hey, can you tone down this post or take out these curse words or
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.400]   something?
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:38.400]   And he's like, no, the whole point is that, you know, by being a little financially independent,
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.400]   I am able to turn down those things that I keep my voice.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.400]   I'm the master of my destiny.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.400]   And it's he's got a forum.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.400]   It's like a whole thing.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.400]   It's like as a hobby, it would be a lot better for you to get into this sort of stuff because
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.400]   you're biking to the store and that sort of thing instead of, you know, a lot of other
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   different ideas.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   I love it that the ad banner instead of being at the top where we ignore it anyway is at
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400]   the bottom.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.400]   That's that's fine with me.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.400]   Forbes just redesigned its site and got rid of the, they're not a banner, but they got
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.400]   rid of all the other stuff at the top, all the, all the, if you just go to a story page,
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.400]   after you get through that, you still have this.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.400]   And now they're doing a countdown, which was, so just pick a story.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.400]   Clunky apps, hold back Apple.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.400]   Everybody, you know, is everybody, oh yeah.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400]   Well, so see, there's this big ad.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:34.400]   Yeah, but they got rid of navigation at the top.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.400]   I think no, it's here.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.400]   No, they didn't.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.400]   Well, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:44.400]   I'm very aware of all this now because we're in the midst of a redesign.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400]   It's, it's tough to balance.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:52.520]   You know, you always want to make the site to be the most welcoming to users, but it's
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.280]   hard to know what's the best way to do that.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.400]   And it's really, it's actually a great thought experiment.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.840]   And we don't have the luxury of being able to do a lot of A/B testing and stuff like
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.840]   that.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.520]   So I'm just going to trust my gut.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.160]   Here's the input in right now in the chat.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160]   Oh, I got it.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.160]   I just got the gap ad.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.160]   Okay.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.160]   Don't do anything.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:28.480]   Oh, disabled notifications from D2i4NXEJA and HW zero H dot cloud front dot net.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.440]   Oh, cloud fronts and advertising agency.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.440]   A lot.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.440]   Matt's loving it.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.440]   Wow.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.440]   Okay, we found him.
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:35.440]   We get them.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.440]   Yes, we began the show with the command.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.440]   Okay.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.440]   We landed it.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.440]   I lost it.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.440]   Little dad.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.640]   How do I get that back?
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.640]   I lost.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.640]   I lost it.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640]   I lost it.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640]   I lost it, Matt.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.640]   Jet Jeff Jarvis has some work to do and we'll let him go do that.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.640]   How do I get that back?
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:00.720]   There's a disabled notifications thing from how do I get that back?
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.640]   Cloud front is the key.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.680]   Not the, not the big numbers at the beginning.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.240]   It's cloud front dot net.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.560]   That's what you want to know about.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.040]   So where do I go?
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040]   So you go to setting.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.400]   I don't know how you, if you can disable them.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.440]   Settings, it's in the advanced at the, you know, the second page and it's under web.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   Content.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.400]   What is it?
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.400]   Privacy.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.920]   It was a whole nice, there was a nice thing.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.920]   Content settings.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.920]   Content settings.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.040]   Content settings.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.880]   Pop ups.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.520]   Now what I would do is do not allow any exceptions.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   Oh, not pop ups.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.520]   It's notifications.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.120]   That's the one where, what, what you do anything?
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.560]   Do not allow, well, just click that.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.120]   Do not allow any site.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.120]   I already did.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.200]   And there's a whole bunch that are there and won't let me change it.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.120]   So you can't delete these.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.120]   I can't, there it is.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.400]   I found that you're right.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.920]   And it just is, is, is in there as an allow.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.920]   Click it.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   I got it for you.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:04.920]   Click it.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:05.920]   You'll see there's an X on the right.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.400]   No, there's not here.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.200]   That's why he doesn't have that.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200]   Oh, yes.
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.480]   See the ones that are in italics have no X's.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.480]   Exactly.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.480]   But the ones that are, yeah, because these are special.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   Bug.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   Most of them are from Google.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.480]   It's not a bug.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:26.240]   Most, but why am I getting game dash so kaband.com allow and it's asked, let's learn more.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240]   Right.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.000]   I've got, I've got, I've got Amazon.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.200]   I have flash cards.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.920]   Hand spot wordpress.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.400]   What are these?
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.200]   Okay, Google's whoever's watching at Google, they're still here.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.320]   What are these italicized ones?
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.920]   And why can't we delete the italicized ones?
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.560]   Oh, we got it.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.400]   Got you.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.120]   We can delete the unitalicized ones.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   You get an X.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.840]   But these are somehow they've gotten themselves protected.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.600]   Power watch power.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.440]   Yeah, but then we're.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:00.320]   But no, Matt, then the same thing was happening.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.960]   It'll sink from some other one.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.960]   Six.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   It's six.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:05.880]   Do notifications get synchronized?
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.680]   Hmm.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:08.680]   Notification settings.
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.360]   They may not.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:14.400]   They shouldn't because you would want different notification settings, perhaps, on different
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.400]   machines.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   I want to see it.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   I'm going to go on.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   Now, though, since I have two machines.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.440]   So what that is, and we should explain, is one of your extensions or apps is monetizing
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.240]   using CloudFront.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.560]   Yes.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.400]   And so, what you really want to do is find out which app is using that.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:36.320]   And it's not, it's not, um, power watch won't do it, Matt, because it's, it, it did sink
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.760]   it to the Chrome on my other machine.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:45.040]   So you, you, I still think you have a, not a rogue extension, but you have an unfriendly
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.800]   extension that is using, uh, notifications to pop up ads.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.640]   And I think you want to find that extension by deleting everything.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.960]   We were doing something, but it's doing something more.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.080]   It's doing something to the notifications, exceptions, and it's making them exceptions
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.080]   to exceptions.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:07.840]   Well, it may be that those, uh, italicized, uh, uh, notifications are, uh, driven by extensions,
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.200]   for instance, and you can't.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.960]   You're not by websites, but cloud convert, whatever the heck.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.080]   Oh, I, I used that one.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:22.960]   But cloud front, it somehow got in here and I can't set by app popular on Netflix.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.960]   Oh, cloud front is a CDN.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.120]   Cloud front is Amazon.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.360]   Not an advertising agency.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.080]   It's a CDN.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.000]   And it was set by popular on Netflix.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.720]   So it managed to sneak in that way.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.160]   I hope there's some good CSI Googlers right now.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:46.000]   So, um, apparently the italicized exception, the italicized notifications can't be deleted
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.440]   because they're associated with apps, not extensions.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.520]   So there's this new thing called apps, Chrome apps.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.880]   So see if you have a Chrome app.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.080]   So I've got apps.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.280]   I got to go through and kill them, but we talked about that last week where I, you know,
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.920]   I go through everyone's wall and kill them.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:04.920]   And cloud front.
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:09.440]   And it came in through, it says here, it came in through Netflix.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.200]   Now, the weirdly about Netflix is what I want to get into.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.800]   What's happened back on?
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.200]   It didn't actually create an app.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:21.920]   It was just a redirect to a web page for Netflix now on Chrome.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.560]   There used to be a part of AWS.
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.840]   It's their CDN.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.800]   Hmm.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.360]   But it said Netflix.
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360]   Well, then I think we're right.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:39.600]   Apparently, it's actually a different address at cloud front than the one I just read out.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.040]   Oh, you're not, you're not doing popular on Netflix.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.040]   Are you?
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   That's it.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.680]   Why do you say that?
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.680]   Are you?
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:52.680]   Is this, is this the one you're doing?
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.680]   This is not from Netflix.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.680]   You know that, right?
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.640]   Did I, did I mess that up?
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:57.800]   No, I didn't do that.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:01.200]   See if you have, there are several extensions that will do things like say stuff that's
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.200]   leaving Netflix.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.480]   No, I see.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.920]   I have an actual Netflix one and it goes to Netflix.com.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.600]   That could be how it did it.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.320]   I don't know.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.840]   We'll know soon.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:18.320]   You might want to check not just the extension of popular on Netflix.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.760]   It's a little popular on Netflix.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.360]   It's there.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.160]   The lead popular on Netflix.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.160]   You don't need that.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160]   You don't need that.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160]   You move from Chrome.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160]   Okay.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.520]   Let's see it again.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.440]   You sure is not going to clean it up?
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:38.600]   You're never going to see it again.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.680]   Sometimes I want to go through all of our extensions.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.720]   What do you, what do you have any favorite extensions that you use on your Chromebook
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.620]   format?
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:46.920]   I do have a few.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:49.760]   Let me see what extensions I've got.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.960]   Oh boy.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.800]   There's a few that there's one that I've written by hand.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.800]   Oh, you have you.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.800]   He writes his own extensions.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.800]   Oh my goodness.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.240]   Well, I use Facebook.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.240]   Well, there was one.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.880]   It turns out you can actually run a Chrome extension off of GitHub.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:14.200]   So you can like download something off of GitHub, you know, unpacked it into a directory,
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.200]   change like three lines.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200]   Ah, that's cool.
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:17.200]   All I did.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   That's cool.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.520]   And then you know, from your local download.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.760]   That's a great idea.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.760]   Yeah, it is.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:28.760]   Like, I found something that takes Twitter, Twitter usernames and makes them links to
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.120]   the Twitter username, which is kind of fun.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.920]   I think I wrote a blog post about it.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.920]   I want that.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.480]   Okay, I'm going to find your blog post.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:37.480]   That's great.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.400]   That's correct.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.880]   And let's see.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:49.680]   Oh, something that makes Hacker News where it's all read so that you can keep track of
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.280]   what you've seen on Hacker News.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.360]   I love Hacker News.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.640]   That's become my product hunt.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.800]   My version of product hunt is Hacker News.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.360]   I think it's news.Y Combinator.com.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.640]   It's really great because it has upvoting.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:08.560]   So it's like Reddit, but it's Reddit for really smart people.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:15.920]   So the number one story on Hacker News right now is announcing Git, large file storage.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.960]   For a while, people were trying to game Hacker News and it was kind of junky.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.720]   And I think they realized nobody cares.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.280]   Number two is Microsoft announces Hyper-V containers.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.040]   But the third one is the one I was talking about.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040]   That's probably where I found it.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.040]   I quit.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:38.480]   What really goes on in Apple, it was that blog post about how life at Apple was so, so challenging.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.280]   Hacker News is so good.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.280]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.280]   Love it.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.400]   By the way, user reviews for popular on Netflix.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.320]   One says it adds advertisement pop-ups in the Google desktop notifications.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320]   I think we've found it.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.920]   Yeah, I think you found it.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:52.920]   Good work.
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.920]   Detectives.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920]   Good work.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920]   Hot dog.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920]   Hot dog.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920]   Woo.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, this, how about this?
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.800]   Teaching Haskell to a 10 year old, day one.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:15.480]   You know, I found a great site on Y Combinator and on news called how Istart.org.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.560]   It's kind of geeky.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:23.400]   It's a bunch of coders, most of them very well known, who work in various programming
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.520]   languages, how they like start a new project.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:34.080]   So Peter Borgon, who is a Go Evangelist and SoundCloud engineer, talks about what you should
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.760]   do, how he starts every new project and go.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.720]   It's awesome.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:42.920]   And then there's some of them are really fun.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:48.520]   The one I like is Fred Hebert, who wrote the most amazing programming book ever, "Learn
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.880]   You Some Erlang for Great Good."
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:56.880]   And he, so if, I don't know if anybody's interested in Erlang, but it's fun because the project
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:03.960]   is a Homer Simpson's nuclear power remote control simulator.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:10.640]   So if you want to blow up Springfield, this is for you.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.000]   And in the process, you learn how somebody who's truly an expert in the language, in
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.520]   this case Haskell, you know, works.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.200]   It's amazing how many people code in Vim.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.720]   It's like, why?
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.720]   Come on.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.520]   It gives you a Vigga.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.680]   Vim and Vigga.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.200]   Are you a Vim guy?
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.200]   I'm a Vimmer.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:33.920]   I'm a Vimmer.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.400]   I'm totally a V-I Vim guy, yes.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.760]   Why do you do anything different?
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.240]   That's all you need.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.360]   Fred is also a Vimmer.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.320]   He says, "Use the text editor of your choice.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.680]   Mine is Vim because I'm a terrible person."
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.160]   You too, Matt Cuts.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.720]   You know what my project is to this last couple of weeks is learn Emacs.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.920]   It's going to take me years.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.320]   But yeah, I always used Vim.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:05.840]   But I want some a little, I know, crazy, right?
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.840]   Just fun.
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840]   You know, keep some mind.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.840]   You didn't have enough carpal tunnel syndrome?
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.960]   It's all key stress, man.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.120]   But you can do anything.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:19.280]   It's like running a nuclear power plant with medicies.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.840]   All right, everybody.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.840]   We should wrap this up.
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:25.000]   It's so much fun, but I think we've got to let everybody go.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.040]   His blog is BuzzMachine.com.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.000]   His books are Legion.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.760]   And he is blessed us every week.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.760]   And we just love it.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.760]   Thank you for being here.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.120]   So I got to give a quick shout out.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.160]   I was doing this event for Quartz magazine, which we quoted on the show twice today, by
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.560]   the way, in Nashville only yesterday.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:51.160]   And Monday night they had a party because it's a sales conference at the Big Brewery
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.360]   in town.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.520]   And the big guy behind the bar, I have recognized this now.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.480]   He looks at me, looks me again, and he said, are you Jeff Jarvis?
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:04.480]   So I want to give a shout out to our fan, Lucas Hendrickson, a Twit and Twig fan.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.480]   And a bartender?
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.160]   And a bartender, it happens everywhere, everywhere.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.160]   I love it.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.160]   It's the power of Leo's.
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.160]   We always agree.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.160]   No, it's not me.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.160]   It's you.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.160]   It's you.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   It's not me.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.160]   It's you.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.160]   It's you.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.160]   It's you.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.160]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.160]   I saw that tweet.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.080]   No, it's mad.
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.040]   It's mad.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.760]   That does have the best laugh ever.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.760]   Matt cuts.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.760]   We love you.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.680]   He said, I just, thanks so much for having me on.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.280]   I just wanted to say very quickly.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.760]   I've had at least two people come up to me and say, hey, I really love you on this weekend
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.760]   Google.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.760]   So it's really fantastic.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.760]   Wow.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.560]   You go pat on the back that way as well.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.520]   So I've experienced what Jeff has talked about.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.840]   That's impressive given that you're one of the first hundred Googlers and all that stuff.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.240]   Anyway, we love you, Matt.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.240]   Keep up the great work.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.600]   And I'm so glad you didn't go to work for that SEO.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.600]   Thanks for having me.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600]   All right.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.440]   So this weekend Google every Wednesday about 1 p.m. Pacific daylight time.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.440]   That's 4 p.m.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.440]   Eastern daylight time.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.440]   That's 2000 UTC.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.240]   I hope you'll tune in and watch live.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]   We love it if you do.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.640]   You can be in the chat room and we can interact with you.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.080]   But if you can't, don't worry because we do make on-demand audio and video available after
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:21.760]   the fact at twit.tv/twig, youtube.com/thisweekengoogle.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.360]   And of course, wherever you get your podcasts, your favorite podcast app on your favorite
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:31.600]   device or like iTunes or the Zoom or whatever it's called, Xbox, or, you know, I use it.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.400]   I think I use it.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.600]   So I want to see pocket casts now on Android.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.120]   That's the one I use.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.120]   In any event, we also have great apps on all of the platforms.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.240]   Thanks to our community of third party developers.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.240]   We don't do it.
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.240]   We'll see you next time.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.840]   Thanks for joining us on this weekend.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840]   Google Belong.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:57.880]   [Music]
