[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff's here, Stacey's here, Ant's here.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.400]   We're going to try our best to explain why GameStop's stock is through the roof.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.000]   It's actually a pretty wild story. We'll talk as always about Google's change log, new things, and things going away from Google.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And a new $60 doorbell from Ring. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   It's time once again for our annual survey here at Twit. We don't want to miss your feedback.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Go to twit.tv/survey21.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Take it now. It's going to close in a couple of weeks.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   The survey helps us understand you so we can make, or at least get to know you.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I don't know if we'll ever understand you. We can get to know you.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   So we can make your listening experience even better. It also helps us with advertising.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   It only takes a few minutes. Just go to twit.tv/survey21 and thanks in advance.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   [music]
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is Twig.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   [music]
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 596, recorded Wednesday, January 27th, 2021.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Squeezing the shorts.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   This week in Google is brought to you by privacy.com.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Instead of having to use your real ones, protecting your identity and the bank information on the Internet.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Right now new customers automatically get $5 to spend on their first purchase.

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   This week in Google, which has nothing to do with Google unless we feel like it.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's really about this ineffable thing we call...
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   What do we call it? The world.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Life.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Don't talk to me of life.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Stacey Higginbotham is here.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   She's the IOT and microprocessor guru on the show.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   The nerdy one at staceyoniot.com.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Hi Stace.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Hello y'all.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Hello.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I was just reading...
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You probably... I don't know how you'd feel about this.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I was reading a blog post by a guy who left Silicon Valley to move to Austin about how awful...
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I always just put one on Insider.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Is this an idea?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I tried to read it, but I don't have a subscription.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You know what? I get it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Austin is not for everyone.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He said it was really hot.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It is hot.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So hot.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And the water was expensive.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   He says, "Yeah, there's no state income tax, but the property taxes and the water and the power are really expensive."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Water power...
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Well, we have a city-owned utility.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Although, I will say my city-owned utility charged me more per kilowatt hour, but it stayed up more often.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Because there were tree lines...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   The city was in charge of trimming the trees, whereas up here, no one's in charge.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And it's just...
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   That's why you had no power trees.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Two.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Now, we have that problem here, which is a PG&E, which is a for-profit utility, has decided when the state gave the money to trim the trees to give it to their executives instead.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So the power lines run through tinder dry brush and trees.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And so that's why they turn the power off when there is windstorm or dry conditions.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   They figure that's better to do than burn the state to the ground.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So there you go.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   There you have it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You know, I read it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It sounded kind of like a whiny blog post about Austin.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I didn't judge Austin.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And then I read the comments on the Hacker News about it.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And everybody was mad at the guy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So I just thought it was funny.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I thought I'd bring it up.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Hi, Stacey.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Good to have you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I mean, I left Austin, so...
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Well, that's what...
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Mostly because it was hot.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   She moved to the Pacific Northwest.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Is that a raccoon on your shawl that you took before you left there?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   What is that?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Oh, this...
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yeah, that's Daniel Boone's hat tail.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   This is my mouse.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Oh, it's cute.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's really...
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That looks so cozy.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   She's wearing a beautiful gray shawl.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Is that a Pashmina?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It looks like a Pashmina.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Is that a shawl?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It's a wool wrap.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   A wool wrap.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   A wool wrap.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Because Pashmina wasn't enough.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And it's actually brown, but...
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It's brown.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yeah, you look like a hobbit.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Let's face it.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the legendary Taapafest.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   That's a chronic former employee of Conde Nast.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   That's why I note the raccoon on her outfit.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You see, that's the way I think.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   That's the way I go.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Leonard Taap, professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Newmark.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Newmark.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And from Hands-On Photography.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Hey, man.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Hey, man.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   In the downtown.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Hello, Anne.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I'm laughing so hard because I'm just waiting on Miss Stacy to reach through that camera.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Unfortunately, I know it won't work, but, Anne, I am with you.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   If I could just text you.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   If y'all were in the studio...
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   You guys behave like...
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   We're going to play nickel back.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Before the show began.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Shandy was on it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Unless you're nice to us.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We were torturing Stacy with Shandy songs.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But Stacy, we can also torture Jeff Jarvis because we can go ahead and show Jeff's room.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We can add a little interloper into Jeff's room.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   You see it there?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You have to go full-screen on Jeff.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Can you do that?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Apparently we...
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Oh, no.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   He disappeared.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Oh, no.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Oh, no.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   He disappeared.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Oh, no.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Oh, no.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He's teleporting in.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   He's teleporting in.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Hi, Bernie.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He set up a little folding chair for Bernie.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   That's the greatest.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Is it my imagination or did these memes burn out faster than usual?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   The shanties and the burnies?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   No.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   No, they...
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   No, they...
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We're still talking about them.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   We're still talking about the dadgum shanty stuff.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Yeah, but only because we're so not with it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Yeah, I think everybody's sick of it.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And and I are trying to move you on, but you're just just sticking in.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Well, the...
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   The Bernie one.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You have it in the rundown, but there was an update.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   If you go to the page where you could make your own Bernie meme, turns out he ran through his
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   API time like crazy.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   9.8 million Bernie memes made.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Wow.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I bookmarked this when I could still use it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He was merging the picture of Bernie at the inauguration with Google Maps Street View of whatever address
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   you put in.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And so you could put Bernie anywhere.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And as you say, Jeff, 9.8 million memes were created, but it was so expensive.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He had to shut the thing down.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And at the bottom, he says, if you'd like what I do, can you buy me a cup of coffee, please?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Nick, Nick's sonny.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   What did you give his name?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Nick's sonny.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Well done, Nick.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Very good.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Outstanding.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But again, the meme has run its course.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So what is that?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Stacy, you think a week is a normal five days when a...
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   When is a meme done?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Oh, I am not Taylor Lorenz.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm old.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   There are.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I mean, for the meme of the guy with his girlfriend looking over his shoulder at another woman.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Oh, that's what we're going on.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's been going for years.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So that's a half-life.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   It's like a nuclear waste.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And you could always, for a well-done meme, you could always bring it back from the dead
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and pull it into timeliness.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Then it's nostalgia.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Right.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I think it's been so bombarded by it.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's like the equivalent of like when hot songs, like the top ten radio songs of the summer,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   when you had to listen to the radio.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Right.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It was always playing.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Always playing.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Night Rangers.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   You have a case of Christmas.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You have a case of Christmas.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And now, by request from Bedminster, New Jersey.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   We bring you Gloria.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Laura Vannegan.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Okay, I can't do it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I don't want to do it.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Let's explain Stacy.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You used to be a financial reporter.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Let's explain what the hell's going on with Reddit, the Securities and Exchange Commission,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   and GameStop.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   By the way, not just GameStop.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Now, Reddit's GameStop traders are turning their attention to AMC stock.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Well, there's two AMCs and they're getting confused between the two of them.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Oh, that's crazy.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.360]   My mom, she gets confused between Best Buy and Bed Bath and Beyond because their stock
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   stickers are so similar.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.000]   So she'll be like, can you give me some sheets from Best Buy?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And I'm like, no.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   No, not Best Buy.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.640]   This also is happening because of platforms like Robinhood, which encourage, because it's
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.000]   free, you know, commission free trading.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   He's free trading.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.880]   Yeah, but really they're making the money on the spread and people don't aren't sophisticated
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.280]   enough to know that you're getting a bad buy price because they're making money on the
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   spread.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.360]   But anyway, it's complicated.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:24.320]   But because that app is so popular with young people, you've got a whole generation, people
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.440]   like my son, who think it's possible to make a quick killing and are attempted to.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.000]   And actually, some people did make a quick killing.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.720]   So we got to explain this starting with, in order to understand this, you have to understand
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.280]   what shorting a stock is.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Stacy?
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   Yes.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.960]   So when you short a stock, you're making a bet that it is going to go down in price.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.080]   So what you do is you usually borrow money, you buy the stock at the higher price, and
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.520]   then you're, okay, hold on.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.520]   Yes, you're sorry.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.280]   I borrowed you for the stock.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   We said it was confusing.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   I hate it.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   I hate it.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.240]   You're borrowing the stock, aren't you?
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.320]   You're borrowing the stock.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   Yes.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   So the bet is it goes down in price.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.120]   So you borrow against the stock at the high price, and then when it goes down--
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.280]   You pay it back at the low price, and your profit is the spread.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   And it speaks to the low price, and it speaks to the low price.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   Okay.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.960]   But if you bet, if you make that bet and the stock price goes up, you have to, they do
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.240]   a margin call, and you have to pay to stay in your short, and that's real money you're
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.440]   paying out.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.000]   And that's what happened with the hedge funds, and that's how they're being bankrupt, because
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.760]   instead of the stock for GameStop, or GameStop falling, it's going up, and the hedge funds,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.240]   they're being called on their margins.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.440]   So they have to pay out.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.040]   This is called a squeeze.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.640]   So when you squeeze the shorts--
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.440]   I love the terminology.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.600]   When you squeeze the shorts, you force them to sell, but when, of course, that pops up
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.200]   the stock, because the stock price goes up, because the squeeze--
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   They've got to buy more shares.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.960]   They go, oh no, quick, quick, quick, get out of the stock, and it goes up.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   So--
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:12.920]   And this has been called the squeeze of a lifetime.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   The Reddit--
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   You believe, well.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:22.960]   Folks, and this is a Reddit subreddit called Wall Street Bets/R/WallStreet, Spellout Street
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.800]   Bets.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.600]   And what the Reddit-- it was kind of a conspiracy to squeeze the shorts.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.040]   They said, oh, all right.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:38.760]   What we could do is essentially it's a meme with real money behind it.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.720]   So these guys basically squeezed the shorts, forced the price up.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.680]   Some people probably made a lot of money, right?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.440]   If you weren't shorting it, if you were going long-- in other words, what most investors
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.360]   do buying the stock expecting it to go up, you would have made some money-- the SEC, which
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.760]   is basically at this point going, whoa, what happened?
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   How do you spell that?
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   What the hell's going on?
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.400]   Steve Reddit, the guy you--
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   Who was it?
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   Who was it?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   Rachel, is that who it is?
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   Steve Reddit, is he doing this?
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.160]   So I want to get-- you know who I want on the show or somewhere to talk about this?
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.400]   I want Patrick Byrne, who is kind of legit gone crazy, but he is the former CEO at Overstock
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.560]   and remember how the hedges came after him.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   Yes.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.520]   And he was squeezed by the short sellers.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.400]   He would be an excellent person to be talking about this.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.680]   I'm going to say, and you're right, this is what hedge funds use to hedge.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.760]   But in general, I think short sellers don't do anybody any favors.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.440]   Remember, for a long time, people were shorting Tesla.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.960]   And in order to kind of preserve their position, they would publish terrible stories, they
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.520]   would downplay it, they'd go into forums and--
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.080]   Oh, this Tesla's terrible.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.400]   Because they really wanted that stock to go down.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.720]   In fact, Tesla stock ended up doing very, very well, and I'm sure they got squeezed,
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   mightily.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.080]   But for a long time, Elon Musk complained, look, we're doing fine.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.360]   All of these bad stories you read are from short sellers.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.840]   Now, I will say, I will say, there is an argument for short selling.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:16.160]   And that if you know something is-- if you really fundamentally believe someone's making
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.960]   a stupid mistake and you can get that out there, then yes.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:27.000]   And so the rationale for short selling is that you believe that something is overvalued
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.080]   and you think that someone else is going to see that too.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.640]   Now, the question, the lines get crossed when you start doing crazy stuff like calling
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.240]   your favorite friend at the Wall Street Journal and planting false rumors.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   Right.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   But I mean, there is--
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   No, it's--
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240]   Some stocks that are trading too fast.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   There's another thing.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   There's another thing.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.840]   It also even-- it also-- I mean, it has a legitimate purpose in the ecosystem.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   But--
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.520]   Well, but people resent it.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.760]   So somebody was saying today, whether it's manipulating the market, I said people think
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   that--
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   Because their payers--
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   Short sellers are manipulating the market.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   Exactly.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   They are.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   So let me explain--
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.840]   Let me give you the chronology so that we can tell you what's going on.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.360]   You might assume, if you just, you know, an unsophisticated person, that a company that
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.440]   was made up of brick and mortar stores selling video games in malls might not have a glowing
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   future, right?
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Right.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.680]   They have 5,000 stores.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.440]   People aren't going into stores anyway because of the pandemic.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.920]   Many of them are in malls that are shutting down.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.680]   And frankly, the video game industry is moving to downloadable content.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   There's really no reason to buy a physical copy of a video game anymore.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.560]   So GameStop became popular with short sellers.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:45.840]   A lot of people took a bet that GameStop was going to go down.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:52.440]   So because a lot of hedge funds were in it and a lot of these people on the Reddit Wall
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   Street, bets don't like these guys.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   Right.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   It does.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:07.280]   And because an analyst at Bloomberg said that maybe GameStop, which isn't expected to even
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.160]   term a profit till 2023, might be a good buy.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.480]   He made what they call a bull case for GameStop.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.400]   And so for the last two years-- I didn't realize he's been going on that long-- this
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.160]   bullish case for GameStop had been showing up on the subreddit and bubbling up.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.880]   I'm reading from a Vox, by the way, really good Vox store.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.400]   If you want to kind of understand how this happened, Emily Stewart did a good kind of
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.240]   explanation of all of this.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.360]   So as Reddit and retail traders started to take notice of GameStop, they also noticed--
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.400]   and I guess you could figure this out-- how heavily shorted the stock was.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.760]   And they figured out-- and this is where you get in trouble.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.320]   If they all acted in concert, that's the key.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.720]   And no individual buyer is going to have enough clout unless you're more in Buffett
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.320]   to move the market.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.160]   But if everybody on Reddit said, hey, guys, this is exactly what happened with storming
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.960]   the capital, except it's storming the stock market.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.560]   It's an orchestrated event.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   Hey, guys.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560]   My Wall Street.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.360]   I'm going to go to shorts and make a profit.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.280]   That might be a pretty good thing.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.560]   So this started about four months ago.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:34.160]   There was a post bankrupting institutional investors for dummies featuring GameStop.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:42.520]   The GameStop stock price went from $20 to $148.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.320]   That's more than 700% growth.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.200]   Now, of course, there's a lot of zigs in that zag.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.920]   And that's the Redditors who buying it, selling it, buying it, selling it.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.080]   Redditors are pissed off also because several times during this process, trading was halted.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.400]   And it's their contention.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   They halt trading to protect the hedge fund, guys.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   They don't care about individual investors.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.680]   They don't care about us making money off of these guys bad short bets, but they are
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.320]   going to protect the hedge fund, guys.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.480]   You don't want to piss off a Redditor even worse.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.480]   Yeah, that's probably the case.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.880]   It's like pissing off a bunch of crypto boys.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.400]   Yeah, you don't want to do that.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:31.160]   A short seller named Andrew left who works for Citroen Research announced on Twitter,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.840]   they'd be hosting a live stream laying out the case for shorting GameStop and saying
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.720]   anybody buying this stock at this point is our suckers.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.440]   They say it's going to go back to 20.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   Don't worry.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.520]   Immediately there were attempts to hack his Twitter account.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.320]   And now he said, I'm not going to comment on GameStop because of the angry mob that
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.240]   has formed against me complained that he'd quote, "never seen such an exchange of ideas
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.360]   of people so angry about someone joining the other side of the trade."
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:10.480]   So basically because of places like Robinhood where a large number of people at no cost
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.720]   in effect, at least no commission cost to them, can trade stocks.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.320]   And because of sites like Reddit where people were able to act in concert, they squeezed
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.200]   the hell out of the shorts.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.000]   And in the process, some people probably made money.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.360]   Now, some people probably also lost money.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.160]   One of the things that's important to understand about the stock market, and I don't know if
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.920]   everybody gets this, it's a zero sum game.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.960]   For every dollar you make, somebody is losing a dollar.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.760]   The only time that's not true is when there's a new issue.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.680]   A company sells stock.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.120]   They get a lot of money.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   You're giving them money.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.600]   That's not totally true to you.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   Where's the whole world?
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   It goes up.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.960]   I was like, if I sell my stock at 15, for example, I have made, well, okay.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:05.240]   This is zero sum game because somebody bought your stock at that price.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.880]   So that dollar that you made...
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.720]   Well, the market tends to go up.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.520]   Well, that's the one thing that probably just changed a little bit.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.520]   It's not...
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.520]   It's not true.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.280]   If I bought it at five, it went up and we're ignoring the time value of money because
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   we're not doing those...
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   But I bought it at five.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.280]   I sell it at 15.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.280]   You made 10 bucks.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.280]   Right.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   Someone else buys it at 15.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.440]   As long as that stock keeps going up, they're fine.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440]   Right.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.200]   I hate to tell everybody because we've been in such a bull market for so long.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   What goes up...
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   Eventually it stops going up.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   It goes down.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.920]   So this is why here's Stacey's free investment advice.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.840]   Always put a set of...
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.280]   Like find some money.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.280]   Your money.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.960]   Allocate a certain percentage, even if it's like 50 bucks a month.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.000]   Allocate that by mutual funds.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.680]   Don't try to chase individual stocks.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   It's stupid.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   Right.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.520]   And just let it go forever.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.200]   Or as long as you can.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.160]   And you will have great months.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.920]   You will have bad years.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.400]   But eventually it should even out and go up.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Dollar cost averages.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   You should index my call up.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   Exactly.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400]   Dollar cost averages.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.800]   But you can say that about some certain stocks too.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.880]   I mean they all have their moments of peaks and valleys.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880]   Just sit on it.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.680]   If you chase the peaks, if you chase the peaks, you're going to find the valleys too.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.760]   No, I'm saying some different, which is investing the stock in a whole different long
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760]   term.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   Right, Aunt?
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   That's actually a good idea.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.600]   There are things that I just bought them all the time ago, but I didn't expect anything
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   that I would appreciate.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   I don't want to get in the business of investment.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   Five.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   No.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   I was like, no, no, Aunt.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   No, no, no.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.680]   It's basically my philosophy that anybody who's giving me investment advice, if they're
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.720]   not already a billionaire, I'm not going to take it.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.920]   Because if you're that smart, why the hell are you telling me?
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920]   You know?
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   Who's not a billionaire over here?
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.520]   Why is such a high standard?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   All right.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   A hundred million.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.080]   In other words, if you're still working for a living, you haven't figured out the stock
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   market.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.080]   All right.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.080]   Anyway, it's-
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.320]   We'll keep going with the tail.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:17.640]   The real point of this is the value of the GameStop stock, whether 20 or 142, had nothing
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.720]   to do with the inherent value of GameStop.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.280]   It was really all about this thing that was going on.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.680]   And it was being propped up or gone up and down.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.320]   You probably could say that the long-term prospects for GameStop aren't that good.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   I don't know.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.760]   I'm not an expert.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.320]   That seems like a fair guess.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.200]   But that has nothing to do with the 700% run up in the value.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.160]   Today, today, it's a low because of red.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   What did it close at?
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.800]   It closed at $348.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.920]   Up 135% from Tuesday's close.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.640]   Market cap of $224 billion.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   The stock traded as high as $380 today.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.720]   Don't you explain something to me?
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.160]   So it's not ended.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.440]   That's the historical thing.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.600]   So let's say I have 1,000 shares on short.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   I can get out.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   I'm going to pay money.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.360]   But it's a question of when I choose to get out, right?
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.800]   Or my squose forever.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.760]   I can just say, okay, I'm walking a lot.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.600]   Yeah, you get out by walking a lot.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.400]   Why does it keep going up then?
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.240]   If people are saying, okay, I see the game, screw it.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   I'm getting out.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.600]   Because not everybody gets out.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.800]   Because not everybody gets out.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.080]   So what also brings up the price is these short sellers as it goes up and up and up,
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.840]   they go, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.120]   If they all got out at a price, then it'd be over.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.600]   And then there's also momentum because people see the price going up.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.240]   And now you get long buyers saying, oh, game stop must be a great stock.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.840]   And that's the warning I want to give people.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.360]   Okay, it's not a perfect zero sum game.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.160]   But if you don't be a chump, don't be a chump.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   And now this is legal as gambling as long as this.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.960]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.480]   So let me ask one more double question.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.400]   So now the stock is at 3.48.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   Geez.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.560]   Logic would say that there's no logic in Reddit or the internet.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.680]   Logic would say now is the time to short the stock.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.280]   Except that it will go up.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   Here's the problem.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.080]   Say here's the problem.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.520]   Here's the problem.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.640]   Your margin can get called.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.920]   So when you go short, you can't just go short and sit.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.640]   If you go, you have to put money down.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.480]   Yeah, at some point, your margin gets called and you have to, you could lose a ton because
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.080]   you're not only is it short, it's generally leveraged, right?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   Stacey.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.320]   So you're, that's why it's so scary.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.840]   So your margin, yeah, you have to put in more money.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.400]   And once you've done that, you're also, you're, you're basically losing more than you thought
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.960]   because you've also borrowed against it.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.840]   So you got to pay that back and then pay the continuing, the continuing spread.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.600]   So there, you don't, you can't just say, I'm going to, I think it's, it's really over
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.200]   value to 300 bucks.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.960]   So I'm going to, I'm going to go short and buy a ton of shares.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.280]   At some point, it might continue to go up and you will get, you'll have to pay the piper.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   You can't just sit on it.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.280]   You'll have to, you'll have to pay back.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.680]   I swear there was a, what was that called?
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.040]   That guy from Homeland was in it.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.040]   Billions, no succession.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040]   Billions.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   Billions.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   There was a whole plot line around a short season.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.600]   You can actually get a lot of, learn a lot about finance from watching billions.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   Okay.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:44.080]   But Bank of America just raised its price target to $10.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.760]   So great because they have a good plans.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   So here's the thing.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.920]   I think this, this is the thing that makes professionals, cuckoo, is that you have all
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:59.280]   of these young people who don't really understand what's going on buying this stock.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.840]   And that's why it's very, now it's gotten really unpredictable because of, I don't
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.160]   know if it's, they don't understand what's going on.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.680]   I think they're just saying, F you.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.920]   No, well, maybe put, let me put it another way.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.840]   When you play chess and you're a good player and you're playing another good player, you
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.360]   have certain expectations.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.320]   You kind of know how to play that person.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.680]   It's actually sometimes hard for a very good player to play a terrible player because they
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.720]   do completely stupid things.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   They're not prepared for.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   It's like, same with poker.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.640]   Poker is a very, actually poker is a better analogy.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.560]   It's a lot easier to play poker against good poker players than it is against a fish who
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.800]   has, you know, you don't know.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.120]   But Stacy's added in something else here, which is, which is righteous anger.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   Yes, yes.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   But I'm saying that.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.640]   In other words, all of these new people coming in the market are unpredictable because they're
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.680]   not acting in a way that a normal trader thinks is rational.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   Right.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   And that includes revenge.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.840]   I think, I think the difference here is normal traders never pay attention to retail
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.760]   investors because they don't have to.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   Right.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   Right.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   That's right.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   Institutional traders, you mean?
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.760]   Right.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   Right.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.880]   They created, yeah, they, I mean, they just, they don't exist.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:20.480]   I mean, so what's happened here is they have given the power to, oh, it's like mass media.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.960]   They've given the power to the bosses to actually hedge funds have to pay attention.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.560]   I'm so sorry, Jack.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.720]   Well, where stock markets started was individual, you know, in the Hudson's Bay Company.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   And individual could buy shares.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   Didn't take long before institutional.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:41.040]   Yeah, it didn't take long before institutional traders in 1789 ruined the whole thing.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.240]   So this is actually a really good point, but from this Vox article, the GameStop episode
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:52.440]   is a mix of factors, both serious and silly part retail traders demonstrating actual power
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.760]   in the market to your points, Stacy, part accepting that some of this makes no sense
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.160]   to my point whether GameStop took off because it's a meme stock, a stock in which interest
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.800]   is as much cultural or social as it is financial or because it's possible there is something
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   in the business case that's unclear.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.360]   There is a business case.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.160]   There is a cultural interest.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.800]   The balance between the two and driving the price, it's unknown is indeterminate.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.720]   Part of it might basically be a joke.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.360]   What is clear is a lot of what's happening with the stock now is not because there's
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.240]   a potential turnaround.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   It's merely because the trade went viral.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:37.880]   But if, and here's a craziness, GameStop somehow got their hands on a container full
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.320]   of graphics cards and they're going to put them on the market.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   And you know what?
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.000]   If anybody would know that, it'd be it'd be Reddit, wouldn't it?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Exactly.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.920]   So then their valuation would be totally assured.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.480]   And that's the answer to your question, Jeff.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.800]   How come the stock keeps going up?
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.880]   It's, you know what it is, in some ways it's the financial market version of QAnon, of
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   conspiracy theories.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   Wow.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.120]   And this kind of viral spread of information and misinformation.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   And the very difficult job of prying one another.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.320]   I think there's any actual information that's there.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   But we don't know.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   There might be.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   That's what Emily's saying.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.440]   Well, Bank of America actually raised the price because they said they actually have
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   a good business plan.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.840]   Yeah, but 10 bucks is not.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   So, said about Visa.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:32.120]   So, American Bank of America is doing this as a salve, as a salve to some of its big investors.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   That's all it is.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.320]   It's like, oh, we still want to be parts of your deals.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.280]   We still want your relationships.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.280]   We're not crazy.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.680]   We're not going to say 3.48.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.120]   But you know, if I can cut your losses a little and give you 10 bucks, I will.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120]   That is all that is.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.600]   And call me cynical, but it's true.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.840]   Should also play out that was sold two weeks ago.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   I'm happy.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.680]   Well, some that's the point.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.800]   And as with any pyramid scheme, the earlier you get the more money you make.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.520]   And while I'm in school here, you would expect it as a zero sum game.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.560]   I mean, you know, that's the problem.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   Go ahead.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   While we're in W school here, I always get confused between call and putt.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   Financial reporter Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.760]   Oh, man, I got to look that up again.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.760]   See?
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.760]   Excuse me.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   Everybody, right?
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.560]   Call gives you the option to buy a stock and a putt gives you the option to sell a stock.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   Right.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.920]   Don't ask me about collars because I will come out there, Jeff, and yell at you.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.560]   Honestly, what Bull and Bear always get those next stuff.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.840]   If you don't know the difference in call and putt, you should probably not be buying
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.320]   stock on Robinhood and Webull and all these others.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.440]   Which interestingly now are way higher up in the rankings in the app stores.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.640]   People are jumping on this.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.200]   But I'll explain Robinhood and why that fuels this.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.880]   You started before, but finished that.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:58.680]   So Robinhood has got a lot of people into trading, especially young people with the promise.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.720]   What email was to spam because of the post office?
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.640]   That's what Robinhood is to trading.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   It's free.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   Sorry.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   Okay.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.560]   Leo's trying to- It isn't really free because you have to spend money to buy the stock,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.080]   but you don't pay a commission.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.280]   The thing is, and the thing that people don't understand is that Robinhood makes a lot of
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.360]   money without charging commission.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.400]   The way they do it is in effect by giving you a bad price for the stock.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.960]   So it is- That's not terribly bad.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.080]   It's just a little bit bad, but scale it adds up.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.720]   You would- I'm about to keep, see all.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.080]   Before you use Robinhood, you should probably compare the price that you're buying or selling
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.360]   with some other places.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.560]   Just to make sure a broker.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   You're getting- Yeah, regular guy who charges commission.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.840]   The problem is now because of the success of Robinhood, all of Schwab and Etrad and all
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.200]   these are starting to follow suit.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.240]   So you have to kind of learn about what the spread is, which is the difference between
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.480]   the price you're paying for it and the price the person buying is paying for it.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.040]   And the bigger that spread, the more money Robinhood's making and the less money you're
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.040]   making.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   So-
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   Did we see this-
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   Can I understand more about this?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.480]   Michael Lewis's Flash Boys is a great book.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   Highly recommend it.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.520]   It talks about the value of a millisecond in trade.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.920]   The whole story starts out.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.200]   They're building a fiber optic connection between Chicago and New York that is as straight
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:32.520]   as possible because if there's even one bend in it that slows the light down.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:39.920]   And that's how time- Because if you can get a millisecond ahead of the trade that happened
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.600]   in Chicago and take advantage of it in New York, you can make money.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.080]   But it's that tight.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:53.040]   And that's what caused those flash mobs, those flash selling- Remember there were some big
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.360]   crashes because all of these automated, it has to be automated.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.520]   Human can't do it.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.240]   So these automated trading systems are very, very volatile.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   It can be very, very volatile.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:10.440]   This is why the finances, financial markets and banks are such big spenders on cloud computing
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.040]   and the latest in networking.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.960]   Just to bring this all back to technology.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   Well, so it was-
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.960]   Could we say this?
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   Could we say this?
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   There's the same thing about this whole network effect about two weeks ago, I believe, with
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:27.680]   Bitcoin, Litecoin, and all the other cryptocurrency just sort of taking a huge spike.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:35.040]   Everyone could jump in and get a piece of Bitcoin going through the likes of PayPal
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.160]   and just put a couple bucks there.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.640]   And people were thinking they had Bitcoin when they pretty much didn't have Bitcoin because
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.440]   it wasn't $13,000.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.240]   Yeah, I lost a lot of Bitcoins since then.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:53.360]   There are a couple of- Of course, there's the Wolf of Wall Street where Margot Robbie
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.240]   explains shorts, which is really a great moment in that movie.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.400]   There's The Big Short itself, which was an excellent film about five years ago, which
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   is based on actually Michael Lewis's earlier book, The Big Short, which is a very good
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   book.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.160]   That's the one that got him started, I think.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.960]   I love- What was the one-
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   Because Michael Lewis was a trader.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   Money?
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.200]   No, no, no, no, it's before Money Bowl.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.120]   It was the one where he was talking about the big swinging D's.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.200]   Yeah, Liars Poker maybe.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.520]   He's an excellent journalist storyteller.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   He really has that.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.760]   Well, and he worked in the industry.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.160]   So- Yes.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.680]   He knows where he speaks.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:40.960]   Liars Poker, his first book, was about his own experience in the financial markets, but
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.280]   also the Big Short is great.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   Money Ball is great.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   That's about baseball.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.680]   Oh, Liars Poker was his first book at the time.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   Yeah, Liars Poker was great.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.280]   First, first, notable book.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.640]   If you want to kind of insight into what it was like to work in the 1980s and 90s in
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   the Wall Street, it's really hysterical.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.840]   Very, very good book and very- I don't pretend to understand any of this, by the way, and
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.880]   you don't have to email me or complain on Twitter about art.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   We've done our best.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   No, you did a good job, I think.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   I don't know what you think.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.880]   Yeah, because you were- I don't know anything.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.920]   I guarantee you, there are people listening going, "You guys don't understand this.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   No, no, no, no, no."
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:23.080]   Well, that happens a lot in the financial markets because they're like, "You don't believe
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.240]   the same things we do.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   You look at it differently.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   You're so naive."
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   You're like, "Am I?"
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.880]   Or, "Am I just smart or not?"
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.720]   That's where it really- It reminds me so much of-
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.240]   I make the deposit and leave it, just and be at peace with it.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.720]   I'm not as stressed out as you folks are about this stuff for a good reason.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:46.200]   It reminds me so much of QAnon and conspiracy theories in general, because a lot of it is
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   belief and faith.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.280]   No, no, no, no, no, no, stop.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   Okay, that's not true.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.040]   There are fundamental values, but what it is is gaslighting.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   It's like- Yeah.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.040]   There you go.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.480]   And it lends itself so well to the modern meat and the-
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.760]   No gaslighting like financial gaslighting.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   Ooh.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   Believe me.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.920]   I have had a mini-a-trader argue with me on things, but yeah.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:16.080]   So it's not a conspiracy theory though, because there is actually fundamental value in most
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.560]   of these stocks and issuances, and maybe it's not where it's at.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.680]   There's always the- I think there- If we really want to get into this, I think there's some
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.880]   really interesting things coming.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:35.080]   One, intangibles like IP are becoming much more important in valuations, right?
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.680]   And we don't really know how to value an intangible, because it's not a hard asset, right?
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:44.960]   Two, I think we've been optimizing for decades for profit margins and efficiency, and we
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.680]   need to start thinking about resiliency.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.080]   And I actually- I tweeted this recently, but this was in response to Intel's- There are
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.200]   some activist hedge funds coming after Intel.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.440]   And one of the issues is they want them to- Intel makes a lot of their own chips, not
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.520]   all but most, and they have- They need to invest in manufacturing still.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.200]   And the argument is, let's not do that.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.900]   Just go to TSMC and- T- Taiwan-
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:14.900]   TSMC?
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.340]   Yeah, it was like TSMC, is that it?
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.380]   Yes, Taiwan- Semi-Kedector Manufacturing Corporation.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.620]   And Intel, you don't need to be in the business of making this, and they're like, "Well, it's
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.620]   part of national security."
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.580]   I don't know if we want to go get on the national security horse, but there is something to
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:36.220]   be said about auto chip makers right now, auto companies can't buy chips from TSMC right
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.540]   now because other companies have ordered them.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.540]   So there's something about resiliency and having a little bit more slack in your supply chain
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.940]   that probably makes it very important for Intel to have their own manufacturing and not
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.300]   outsource all of that.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.940]   The point here is that Wall Street thinks in terms of efficiencies and eking out profit
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.020]   margins, and I don't think that fits in today's world.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.980]   That was a really long thing.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.020]   But since we're talking about financial value in Wall Street and conspiracy theories, I
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.580]   figured I'd throw that in there.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.580]   Done.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.580]   If we could go on and on...
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.580]   It's Stacey Will.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:19.180]   No, about honestly, there's some real structural issues in general in our financial markets,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.980]   in the intersection between our financial markets and our politics.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.700]   I mean, and the problem is where there's a lot of money to be made.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.020]   You can never trust people's motivations.
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.380]   Integrity goes out the window sometimes, if there's a lot of money in there.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.020]   Any system that can be game will be game.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.020]   That's the fundamental law of life.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.380]   Markets prove it, the internet proves it.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.860]   It's being game proves it.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.460]   That's actually perfect synopsis.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.460]   That's exactly right.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.060]   I first learned that when my friend Kevin Rose was running Dig, which was a great idea,
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:58.220]   brilliant idea, brought to its knees and eventually dismantled by gamers, by people gaming the
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   algo.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:05.060]   And our friend Matt Cuts, that was his full-time job for years, was block...
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.660]   Effectively blocking gamers from gaming.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.860]   The fundamental mistake that the platform was all made was not doing, especially.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.420]   Google did it better because they were dealing with information, not people.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.300]   They had Matt Cuts, who was brilliant.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.060]   Hi, Matt.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:23.540]   They dealt with spam and things like that.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.540]   When you deal with people, gaming people, that's the problem with Facebook and Twitter.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.980]   It's just much sicker in some ways.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.220]   And I put myself in this boat.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.300]   I was too optimistic.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.740]   And certainly the founders of these companies were, and they didn't build in enough systems
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.620]   to detect and counteract the gaming.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.020]   They thought there was such a thing as neutrality.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.340]   You can't do that.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.820]   That's the beauty of people is we'll work around.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.820]   They'll get away around.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.820]   They'll like ants.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.820]   We're the worst.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.820]   We're the worst.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.820]   We're awful.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.820]   We're awful.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.820]   The problem is me acknowledging the problem is not me, by the way.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:06.980]   Yeah, and so if you look at that, sorry, not you, Anthony.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.980]   The little one.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.340]   You have a sugar spill and you put something in front of them.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.020]   They will find a way.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:22.100]   And if I were the kind of person that wanted to build giant edifices of conjecture and
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.780]   cause an effect, I would say that's because ants, in effect, work like network.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.420]   They're not individuals.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.140]   They act in concert.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.660]   And so they're very able to get around things, flow around things like water.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.580]   An individual might be stymied by that barrier, but they signal to one another.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:45.420]   They're very clever.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.540]   It's so hard for me not to despair.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.820]   I just say humans are awful.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.820]   Anything with a critical mass of humans is going to go downhill.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.380]   At the same time as, yes, it's not false.
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.380]   It's true.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.940]   But at the same time as we're awful, we're amazing.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.740]   We create amazing works of art.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.940]   I mean, we went to the moon.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.860]   I mean, we're amazing.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.180]   We're both at the same time.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   We are such a contradiction.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.180]   We have choices.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:17.140]   That's the whole point is that we have choices and it's not all of life hasn't gone to hell
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.140]   in a hand basket.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.900]   All of life is not utopia.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.100]   And every turn we have choices to make and we need to make those choices informed.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.020]   Oh my God, we're back at the Garden of Eden.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.020]   Holy mackerel.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.020]   We now discovered.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.540]   I could argue against that because I don't know if we do have choices or maybe we make
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:34.540]   all choices simultaneously.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.540]   No, we have.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.780]   I feel like you should be saying we have the ability to make choices.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:45.580]   Yes, whether we actually do that effectively is another matter.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.580]   And I think-
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.660]   It does part of the fine though.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.700]   That's another argument, long time argument about free will versus determinism.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.700]   Oh boy.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.700]   Oh boy.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:41:00.020]   You believe this week you believe we have free will.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.820]   Maybe we don't.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.780]   We should do this week in Calvin.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.420]   Who was that sponsor?
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.660]   Anyway, I'm thanking you for indulging our conversation about this.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.660]   I find it fascinating.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.940]   This whole game stop thing.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.420]   And now it's happening in AMC.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.940]   And now that these people have felt their oats, this Reddit subreddit and others, I expect
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.940]   to see more of this kind of behavior.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.180]   Will there be a healing function?
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:31.580]   A lot of times when you get these, they always talk about not marching in lockstep across
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:35.780]   a bridge because the resonance of all your footfalls will actually break the bridge you
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.780]   have to break step.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.780]   Don't say that to me.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.780]   Don't say that to me.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.780]   That's scary.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.180]   So you have to break step.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.540]   Is there some sort of, I don't think it's the SEC.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.860]   I think SEC just went, what happened?
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.540]   There's nothing illegal about this, right?
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.620]   Reddit it is all public.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.540]   There's no insider information, right?
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.540]   Is there anything possible illegal?
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.540]   This is not illegal.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.780]   This is actually how hard it is.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.500]   Pump and dump is illegal.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.500]   Pumping and dumping.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:08.100]   And there is manipulation through like sending people, seeing false information about short
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.980]   sellers because that's what Patrick Byrne was so upset about.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   That's right.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.740]   They just told the line in that Reddit group, right?
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.740]   They were right up to it.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.740]   They're not dumping.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.740]   They're just pumping.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:30.260]   I should warn you that there is a risk, a guy on Twitter who started posting in 2016,
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.220]   his real name, he posted it on the name Ricky Vaughn, you might have seen his tweets, his
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.100]   real name Douglas Mackie of West Palm Beach, Florida, has been indicted by the Department
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:45.500]   of Justice for conspiring with others to spread election misinformation, not stock misinformation,
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   but election misinformation.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:52.220]   Designed to private individuals of their constitutional right to vote, he's been charged with violating
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.140]   the civil rights conspiracy statute.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   The penalties for that could be up to 10 years in prison.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.060]   So I think that there are.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.060]   Okay.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:09.060]   No, no, no, no, that's, but the legal argument there is related to voting rights, not related
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.660]   to anything regarding stock.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   Understand.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.660]   Or peddling this information.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.660]   I understand.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:17.740]   And it's probably a civil, I don't know what pumping dump is that a civil or criminal?
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:22.300]   Pumping dump is civil and pumping it up actually doesn't have anything to do with short sellers
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.740]   necessarily pumping it up.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:30.540]   Anytime you pump up, it's usually with OTC stocks, it's when you give false information
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.220]   and you talk up a stock and then you.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.860]   So that you can sell, you can get a higher price and sell it.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   Right.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.380]   So as you pump up the price, the dump is, you sell it as soon as that price goes up.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.180]   It's a form of fraud and it's been absolutely, you know, used to be a lot harder to do.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:50.580]   But now thanks to social media, it's a lot easier.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.940]   And those kinds of things were why we had, you know, we, we have state, most states have
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:01.300]   regulations and the SEC has regulations, although they are being dismantled by the venture capital
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.780]   industry, believe it or not, against common people and common people.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.700]   It's unsophisticated investors.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.580]   Well, that's what the Wolf of Wall Street went to jail for, in fact.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.780]   And when I used to work at a, I worked at a local business journal and you would actually
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:24.580]   see companies created go on the OTC market and pitch their, pitch their stocks.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.140]   Now those were public.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.380]   So you, anyone could buy them, you didn't have to be sophisticated, but you could also
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:36.460]   see how it would be very easy for someone to go, you know, go to a bunch of old people
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.020]   and pitch this great, like, Hey, I'm going to do COVID testing.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.180]   And then we're going to go public.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.380]   So I just need you to invest, you know, 10,000 today.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.620]   And you know, you've got your file, you've got your papers for incorporation.
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.620]   You've got all this.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.260]   And then people give you the money and then you just run.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.820]   And that's, that's why.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.820]   That's called Kickstarter.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.460]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, don't get me.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.100]   I've been, I've been pumped many times.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.780]   And then dumped.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.500]   I'm supposed to get a briefcase.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.580]   I ordered two years ago this week.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.580]   Oh, Lord.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.220]   That's my target.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.580]   Take it where.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.380]   Every time I do that and I, you know, I get the, I get like a package two years later.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.380]   I go, what is this?
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.860]   Oh, God, I definitely remember ordering this.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.980]   And then it turns out it's like made a plastic.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.700]   It's like you feel so stupid.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.700]   Yeah, stupid.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.060]   I fall for that stuff all the time.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.060]   So, so, wait a minute, we, we, we, we, you know, one of my, one of my sports on the show
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.900]   is to get you to buy something occasionally.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:44.980]   Can you buy a one share short on GameStop and just see how it plays out today?
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:45.980]   Oh, don't do that.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.980]   Don't do that.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:47.980]   Don't do that.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:52.900]   Please don't, don't discuss this on here.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.660]   How do you know I haven't already?
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.660]   Oh.
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.660]   No, I don't.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.660]   I don't buy individual stocks.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:59.660]   He doesn't do that.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.660]   He doesn't.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.100]   Yeah, for a variety of reasons.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.180]   Wasn't there some sort of penny stock story?
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.180]   I don't know if it was in our, yeah, let's talk about Google run down.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.500]   Let's do an ad and then talk.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.260]   No, no, no, no, no, I want to talk about this.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.780]   Any stocks?
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.780]   Nothing good comes from any stocks.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   Nothing good.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:20.780]   All right.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:26.340]   I, I felt like I read something in the news recently, but I will, I'll stop.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340]   I'll stop right here.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.340]   Yes.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.260]   Let's, let's mention, yeah, Quibi.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.980]   Let's, let's mention one of our fine sponsors.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.980]   What do you think?
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.980]   How about that?
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   Good.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   I love it.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.900]   Actually, this is one that you will really appreciate.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:47.940]   This is one everybody should know about and one I can say I've been using for a long time.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   Privacy.com.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.940]   Have we talked about privacy on the show?
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.100]   So here's the idea of privacy.com.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.860]   Write a credit card that can, and there's two ways you can do it that can only be used
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.860]   once.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.700]   Boom, it's a burner or and I do, this is what I do all the time, locks to an individual
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.340]   merchant.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.140]   This is so cool.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.700]   A lot of companies used to offer this.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.700]   A number of credit card companies used to do this.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.420]   They stopped, most of them for some reason, I'm not sure why, but this idea of a single
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:24.900]   use credit card is something I use on the internet almost exclusively at privacy.com/twig.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.740]   Privacy.com is named privacy though because it's more than just protecting you from fraud,
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.380]   misuse of your credit cards.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:37.540]   It also keeps your personal information, your bank information from the retailer.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:42.660]   It's a great way to, how many times have you bought a subscription online, a recurring
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.820]   charge?
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.500]   And then you forget and it goes on for years and blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.060]   With privacy, if you use a privacy.com card, you can pause the card.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.620]   You don't have to figure out how to cancel something, you just pause the card and it can't
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.780]   be charged.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:02.660]   Furthermore, with privacy, you will automatically get notified about any declines.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.140]   So if somebody tries to misuse your card, you'll find out.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.500]   If somebody tries to charge a card that you paused, you'll find out.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:16.420]   You can set limits, you can say this card can only be used for $50 a month or a year
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.420]   or whatever.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.900]   So you'll never get overcharged, you'll never get charged twice or upgraded to another service
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.940]   without your consent.
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.700]   And if you subscribe, I wish I'd done this, I subscribed to a gym a couple of years ago.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.300]   When in officially canceled my membership, didn't pay any attention, they continued to
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.020]   charge my credit card for six months.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.940]   And I finally contacted the credit card, they said, "Well, we can only reverse charges for
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.100]   three months."
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.420]   And we have to investigate.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.460]   It was very frustrating.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.020]   Next time I'll use privacy, I don't know why I didn't.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:51.380]   And then you don't have to jump through customer service hoops, you just block the charges.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.860]   And they'll notify you anytime that somebody tries to charge over the allotted amount, you'll
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.420]   always stay within your budget.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.460]   There's a Chrome or Firefox extension.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.460]   So you can instantly create a new card and fill it in with one click.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.140]   Privacy doesn't require that to use the charge.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.300]   The merchant is great.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:14.020]   So when I charge an Amazon or Audible or I can go on and on, Nest, all of those are
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:17.420]   using single merchant privacy cards.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.940]   So no one can steal that card number and use it anywhere else.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.300]   I love that.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:27.580]   It's really easy to safely share a card with a friend, a family member, or co-worker.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.100]   I wanted to buy my mom dinner.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:36.820]   So I set up a DoorDash account using a privacy.com card so that I was able to share it through
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.500]   privacy so there was no risk of you don't even have to email it or text it to her.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.540]   It was very easy, no screenshots, copy or paste.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:45.540]   I shared the card.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:50.340]   There's a button on it and you give my mom's email address and it's done.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.140]   They handled the rest.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.060]   They give complete reporting, which is great.
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.900]   You get an account summary so it's easy for you to track how much you've been spending
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:57.900]   this month.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.300]   There's now a new summary page for budgeting.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.300]   You can filter by date, see how much you've spent in a month, no guessing where your money's
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   going.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.500]   I just go on and on.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:12.740]   I've been using privacy for several years now and it's the only card I use when I buy
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.740]   online.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.580]   It's just so convenient, so easy.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.300]   Just so you know, it isn't a charge card.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.740]   You can't build up a, actually to me that's a benefit.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.980]   I can't build up a balance.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.380]   It comes right out of my bank account.
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.700]   You can attach it to a debit card or bank account.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.860]   But there's no temptation there for me to overspend.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.820]   I actually really like that.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.500]   I can just go on and on.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.420]   It's been a lifesaver for me and I think you're going to love it.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.820]   Protect your financial identity.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.260]   Don't give out your real credit card numbers.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.300]   Use virtual cards.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.300]   Privacy.com/twig.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.340]   Sign up for a new account and you'll automatically get $5 to spend on your first purchase.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.540]   It's not a lot but it's a little thank you from us and an encouragement to use that special
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.940]   address because then they know you saw it here.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.300]   Privacy.com/twig.
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.380]   This is just a no brainer.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.500]   Use virtual numbers.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.420]   Mask your bank information.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.780]   Keep yourself private and secure.
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.660]   A great way to start the new year.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.420]   Little digital hygiene.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.420]   Privacy.com/twig.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.340]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:23.740]   This week in Google and we thank you for supporting us by going to privacy.com/twig.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:27.180]   Are you old enough to remember the charge plate as opposed to charge?
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.020]   They call it a plate.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:35.180]   Yeah I remember I'd go to Macy's and it was a funny shame and they put it in the machine.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.180]   You do.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:40.180]   And they call it a plate.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.180]   We used it.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.180]   I said so much.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.180]   And it had notches in it.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.180]   Yeah when I worked with the first one.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.180]   We had one notch.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.180]   We went our power.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.180]   We went our power.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.180]   We went another notch.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.180]   Oh.
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.180]   Oh.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.340]   And it was a metal plate like an address the graph plate.
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.340]   That's what it was.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.980]   Your name and account number was raised.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.980]   Bossed on it.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.980]   Was it raised?
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.980]   Right.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.980]   And so the carbon paper, I have to explain that to you kids.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.980]   What carbon paper is.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.860]   The carbon paper would come down and make the impression on the paper which is how they
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.260]   would bill you later on a paper receipt.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.780]   Are you old explaining this?
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.780]   And tonight both of you.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.780]   Really?
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.780]   I am old.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:14.780]   I know all about that.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.780]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.980]   I used to use them when the power went down at the grocery store where I worked there.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.980]   Wow.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.500]   So I stopped explaining that.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:28.380]   My mother used to be a buyer for a retailer there in Carolina's.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.220]   So I saw all of that stuff dealing with her and her job.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.820]   So yeah, I remember that stuff man.
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.940]   I got a new guy explaining.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:41.420]   So you see this when you're watching the NFL all the time or I said a lot of the inauguration
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.940]   where people wear their mask below their nose.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   That's pointless.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.940]   It's a new cut.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.980]   Instead of it's the new man spreading.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:54.260]   It's called mask spreading.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.060]   I have now masked spreading.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.060]   All right.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.060]   New term.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.060]   I just.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   All right.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.060]   What's next?
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.060]   T.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.460]   He wants to talk about Google announces plans to tackle privacy issues and online advertising.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:12.900]   What it really means is that Google is like Facebook terrified by the new IDFA rules on
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.300]   the iPhone.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.220]   The new privacy rules are really given it.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:23.420]   It's estimates like it's cost and Facebook like 15 million a month or something.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:27.980]   So Google is trying to figure out a way to in fact, I think they're going to do it.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:34.180]   They've announced they're not going to use the IDFA, the ID for advertisers from Apple.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:39.180]   Because if they do use it, they have to pop up a thing on the iPhone that says, Hey, we
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.620]   would like to use this to track you and give the users a chance to turn it off.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.220]   Of course they know.
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.220]   People are going to just decline.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.220]   They're going to say, You're right.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.220]   I don't want that.
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.340]   Turn it off.
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.940]   So Google has been working very hard to figure out a way around it.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.820]   They've decided not to use IDFA.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:01.180]   So they don't have to do that announcement.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:05.740]   They're basically their plan is to create a new way of tracking you.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.580]   They're not going to call it that.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.940]   They say privacy first.
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.900]   So this is from the Guardian, Google's new plan to tackle privacy issues.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.140]   I just wanted you to have that background.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.820]   I'm a sick and online advertising.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:25.980]   I know this is the same, but what about it?
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:31.820]   It makes me think of the whole GDPR when it started up a couple years back and look at
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:38.060]   what has it given to us as consumers nowadays other than that annoying pop up that people
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.460]   don't read and just hit it set.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.980]   Well, I think it empowers users in this case on the iPhone.
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:50.060]   You don't use an iPhone, so you don't see this.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.860]   I wanted to smart ones.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.260]   Kidding, kidding, kidding.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:58.780]   When you look at apps in the App Store, there's actually, it looks like a nutrition label,
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:04.220]   a privacy label that tells you, you certainly are aware of the fact that there has been
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.460]   an exodus away from WhatsApp, right?
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.340]   And signals going through the roof.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:13.300]   That is exactly because of Apple's new privacy policy.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.980]   People, that and the fact that WhatsApp and, you know, felt obligated to say, and by the
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.780]   way, which we've always done, we're going to share this information with Facebook, but
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.580]   the thing is it's now explicit.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.060]   And so people are going, what?
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.420]   I know, I don't know why they're surprised.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.420]   What?
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.740]   You're sharing my information with Facebook and they're going to somewhere else like signal.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.500]   Signal's gone through the roof.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.380]   Telegram's gone through the roof.
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.100]   So if you ask me, what's the impact?
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.940]   I just have to point to that by itself.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.780]   And that's just one of many.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.780]   Fair.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:49.940]   Google has been avoiding this by not updating their apps.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:53.700]   We talked about this before since the middle of December.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:56:01.100]   And they did say initially, oh, we're going to do it, but they have announced a plan to
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:06.620]   as the Guardian puts a chart a middle ground between Apple's privacy first approach and
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.380]   the needs of advertisers.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.780]   So let me explain what Google's trying to do.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.820]   They will use AI.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.220]   This is actually kind of what Apple's already doing.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.020]   Apple calls it differential privacy.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:29.620]   They'll use AI to bundle your information, individual information, with similar people.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:33.020]   In an attempt to convince users they don't need to block all tracking on the internet
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.820]   to preserve their privacy.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:41.900]   It's going to use a-- and the Guardian puts this in quotes-- "trusted server to store advertisements
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:45.260]   without needing to connect to hundreds of providers across the wider web."
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:46.340]   That is a problem.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:51.020]   In fact, advertisers often ask us if-- because we have some banner ads on our website, if
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.380]   they can serve them.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.540]   And we always say no for that very reason.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:01.460]   Because in effect, if a third party is serving an ad on a website, that third party has access
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.700]   to everybody who goes to that website sees who it is, right?
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.620]   So Google's going to use a central server.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:13.460]   They're also going to use crypto to ensure that advertisers only find the information
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.060]   they need to pay websites.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:21.940]   We believe this is Chetna Bindra, Google's head of user trust and privacy for advertising.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.060]   That's got to be a tough job.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:30.540]   Chetna says, "We believe the notion that its privacy or its advertising is a false choice.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.820]   We really do believe there's a way to meet user expectations and protect their identity
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.940]   while allowing for ad-supported content."
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:42.700]   I think-- so relate this, if you would, to the post-cookie Google Sandbox.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.700]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.380]   It's the same exact thing.
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.300]   Google says it's going to start experimenting in Chrome with how to do that a new privacy
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:56.100]   sandbox bundles together five proposals with bird-themed code names.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.100]   My favorite is--
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.100]   What?
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:09.220]   My favorite is Flock, F-L-O-C, Federated Learning of Co-Horts, Fledge, which is first locally
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:18.460]   executed decisions over groups, and Turtle Dove, which is not an acronym, to uncorrelated
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.060]   requests than locally executed decision on victory.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.060]   Oh, it is.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.060]   Sort of.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.060]   Yes, it is.
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:33.100]   Incorrelated requests than locally executed Turtle, decision on victory Dove, noe.
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:43.740]   These are all designed in effect to separate the user's identity with the user's information.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:50.220]   They think preferable to Apple's system, which is just say, "You can't track them."
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:54.700]   Publishers are freaked out.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.260]   Yeah, well, this is Google's business.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.700]   This is how they make money, period.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.140]   Well, the publishers too are freaking out.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.580]   Why are publishers freaking out?
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:09.500]   Because a lot of them basically aren't doing very well at selling their own ads.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.980]   They've never done well at getting first-party data.
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   So they depended upon these networks that required third-party, and they had to produce cookies
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.340]   to serve to these sellers.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.620]   They never got their act together to create first-party.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.740]   So they're going to see a fallen value.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:32.300]   I have to say, for people like Stacey and others who have advocated regulating, there
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.740]   should be some nice governmental solution that would make this all work out.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:41.060]   This is a good argument for the power of regulation, because they're only doing this because
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:48.020]   of EU, GDPR, the Investigations from the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.780]   This is them and Congress.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.780]   This is them.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.780]   Yes, but what they are doing in Congress is here.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.580]   Maybe if we do this, everybody will be happy.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.580]   But the publishers said, "regulate them," and then they regulate them, and then there's
[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.580]   unintended consequences.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:05.300]   So what happens too is that there was a Guardian story not long ago that regulators
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.700]   looking into Google getting rid of cookies.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.460]   Well, you told them to get rid of cookies, and cookies were evil, so they get rid of
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.540]   cookies, and then, "What do we get rid of cookies?
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.700]   You have too much power.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.500]   It's the old can't win too."
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:22.920]   Well, Google did say publishers may see, will see, a palpable impact on their Google ad
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.860]   revenue on iOS once this happens.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.380]   So you're going to try to capture again.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.540]   Google can afford this.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.540]   They can do whatever they can do.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.180]   You want us to re-regulate how all of advertising works?
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.860]   Okay, we'll do that, and we're going to end up stronger than we were before.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:41.460]   It's way all of these things, GDPR, all of these things have made the platforms stronger
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.700]   in the end.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.820]   And Allison Schiff writing it at Exchanger.com says Facebook could take a multi-billion-dollar
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:57.060]   revenue hit from Apple's IDFA changes as much as 7% of total revenue in quarter two.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:03.700]   Actually, she's quoting a consultant, Eric Sufert of Mobile Dev Memo.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.260]   That'd be about $5 billion based on the current revenue.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.940]   That's a significant.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:15.020]   So to answer your question, this is more than a cookie checkbox.
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.860]   This is a big-
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.060]   It changes the architecture.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.460]   You think in a bad way, Jeff, do you think it's going to harm publishers?
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.460]   Well, no, no, I know it's going to harm publishers.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.460]   Yes.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.460]   That's because they don't have the data.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.460]   Google has the data.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   They don't have the data.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.460]   And they can't share-
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.460]   You never have the data, though, right?
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.860]   Because they were in networks of third-party data.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.860]   So when you demonize third-party data and you never had your own strategy to get first-party
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.020]   data, you're screwed down.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.940]   I'm not saying that that's necessarily a bad thing because the publishers should have-
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.740]   I've argued to them for 10 years now that they should have created the means to get their
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:55.180]   own first-party data by creating things that were customized for users rather than just
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.180]   a mass.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.860]   But they refused to do it.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.860]   They absolutely refused.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.420]   They just didn't know how to do it.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.820]   And so they're dependent upon programmatic networks.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.660]   And one of the pioneers of programmatic was at an event that I had at my school.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.860]   And this person scolded the publishers in the room and said, "Why the hell are you
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.860]   on programmatic?
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.900]   You're commodifying yourself.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.100]   There's no value to your environment.
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.980]   There's no value to your brand.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.220]   You're just putting your stuff out there as a commodity."
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.820]   And they said, "We got to.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.100]   We got nothing else, basically."
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.420]   And plus, that's where the advertisers are.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.980]   So the publishers could have, 20 years ago, built better strategies.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.540]   And then this wouldn't be an issue for them.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.100]   It's an issue for them because they didn't do that.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:43.900]   Oh, this stuff was also a move in target too back in the day.
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.860]   So it's, we can't really say they planned it poorly.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.220]   It's not like moving target.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:52.700]   Well, no, I'll disagree to this extent.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.180]   You're right, Ant, when it comes to understanding, putting your figure to the win and predicting
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.180]   where the ad technology was going to go.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:03.820]   But in terms of a basic strategy of saying, "If I know my users and I have a direct relationship
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:09.380]   with my users and I serve them in a high value way through knowing them, then they would
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.860]   have been set up properly and they would have been ready to buff it through lots of storms."
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:14.860]   But they didn't.
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.580]   They just said, "We got all those inventory.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580]   We can't sell it.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580]   Let's fire the salespeople.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   We'll put it up on programmatic and..."
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.740]   And what did they really have a choice now looking back then?
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.740]   Looking back, did they have a choice?
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.740]   Yes.
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.740]   Yes, they absolutely did.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.340]   They had started then to build these platforms.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.340]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.700]   The New York Times did that because it's the New York Effying Times.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.780]   So the New York Times built its food, app, and food business just for this reason.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.260]   So they know you're a foodie and they can sell you high value things.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.260]   They just started that like two years ago.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.260]   I mean, or...
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.700]   And then the New York, well, I think actually longer than that, but they're the New York
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.380]   Effying Times, so they can do that kind of thing.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.780]   They have the money to develop it.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780]   They have the brand.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780]   They can convert.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.660]   They can do all that.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.540]   But yeah, newspaper companies could have done this.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.100]   They could have done it locally.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.140]   What town do you live?
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:10.260]   I tried the hell I went through to try to get newsrooms to merely geotag content with
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:16.020]   a town or county, even the county, just geotag it so we could serve it to people based on
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.460]   where they're coming in from.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:21.660]   Or I wanted to set it up so that you would have your own little feed and I'll tell you
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.020]   where I live and where I work and we'll give you a feed.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:30.180]   I could not get a single newsroom in my company or other companies ever to do that.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.980]   They just make one product for everybody and they want to find new ways to pay for old
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.260]   ways to do the business.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.260]   All right.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.020]   But let's talk about the present because it's too late now for that.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020]   I know.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020]   I know my grandpa moment.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020]   What do you think?
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.300]   At least it sounds like Google's trying.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.860]   So Apple has been...
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:51.060]   And honestly, I support Apple, but Apple finds fun ways to kill the ad business because
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060]   it's not in it.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.060]   It's not in it.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.060]   It's not in it.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:58.940]   And there are going to be consequences to this.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:05.900]   Google's trying to do the best it can, balancing the interests of advertisers and the requirements
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:11.140]   from Apple and the interest, let's point out from its customers in privacy.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.860]   What do you think of Google's attempt to do this?
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.220]   It seems like a good start, yes?
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.220]   I think it's a...
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.220]   And they're trying to bring the publishers in.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.700]   They're trying to train the publishers, but publishers are still going to lose a fair
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   amount.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.700]   But yes, this is...
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:28.700]   But again, let's not forget.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:33.100]   If you're a Google find, if you're a publisher who has political club find, let's say you're
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.100]   a Leashmo...
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.100]   But the Indianapolis...
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100]   But the Indianapolis...
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100]   You're fine.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:45.340]   Well, or you're a travel search engine, a small travel search engine, right?
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.180]   And I don't know what happens to you.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.660]   An entirely new architecture of advertising.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.660]   Or a third party...
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.060]   Because what you did before was, I could generate data.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.820]   I could say this person came...
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.660]   This person's getting to my site, they looked at boots.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.660]   Now I can put a cookie on them to say, "This is a boot-interested consumer, and the boots
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.580]   are going to follow you all around the internet for six weeks, even if you bought the damn
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.680]   things, right?"
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.220]   That's how it operated.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.540]   And I could get money by generating that data or I get money by serving that ad.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.220]   I could play in a couple of ways.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.660]   Well, now I can't really play in either because third party data is outlawed.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.940]   So people can afford their own.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.500]   They know where you've gone on the internet.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.260]   They know how to do this.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:28.100]   But little tiny Leo's travel site...
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:33.100]   No, you're at a subtle luck.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.100]   I would say...
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.100]   Sorry, Stacey.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.100]   No, no, no.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.540]   I'm just going to throw something out here.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:43.940]   I know we're focused on advertising, display advertising.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:50.060]   But I think as technology moves deeper into our lives and you look at things like digital
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:55.420]   assistance and you look at voice...
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.500]   We get into this weird place where...
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.780]   And there will be fights over this.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.340]   When I ask for something, I get it.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.540]   And I don't know the business model behind it, but it's not advertising.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:07.860]   It's not what we see today.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.860]   Yes, I agree.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:17.900]   So, I feel like to go forward, you've got to think about how do you charge for these
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.900]   things?
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.740]   How do you not alienate your user?
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.380]   Because that's where...
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   And I was talking to my husband about this, Andrew, and he was like, "Well, I think companies
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.420]   like Google's assistant will say, 'Hey, it's your wife's birthday next week.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.740]   Do you want to order flowers for $39?
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.540]   Do you want to order these flowers?"
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:44.340]   And then what happens is, Floris will bid for the chance to get you to serve you that,
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.940]   which is a different type of programmatic market.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   Yes.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   And isn't really as based.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.740]   As a permission-based market.
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.700]   Yes, I want flowers.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.180]   Show me the best you got.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.180]   And so we're getting to that.
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:08:00.660]   So I think it's really like we're looking back at what the mistakes that we made, but
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.580]   we need to be looking forward to like, what does privacy look like under that framework?
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.580]   Amen.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:11.260]   come from yes yes and and take advantage of new opportunities you know I who
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.380]   might might I have you know my a vuntular uncle jeff obnoxious standard lines for
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:22.040]   my students you can imagine one of them is that when journalists face a problem
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:26.380]   they report on it and go to the bar when engineers face a problem they try to
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:31.020]   solve it and and when one player is facing problem they try to exploit it
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:37.620]   right and and so the problem is we need to pay for these services in new ways
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.780]   my business hasn't done that but there's lots of new ways but but beyond that
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:46.160]   there's new services like what you just said I the the by the way my sister
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.420]   scared me the death two days ago she texted me and she said isn't today your
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:55.860]   wife's birthday I knew better but it's just it's next month damn it and she
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:02.020]   gave me a heart attack so yeah I could use that service right I think you know
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.860]   you've heard by spiel in the show before I think that the internet thus far has
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.700]   been built to speak and I celebrate that because we have black lives matter and
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.420]   we have me too but it hasn't been built to listen so I think there are services
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:16.580]   to be had to help me find who and what are worth listening to and maybe to
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.860]   verify things right as I've said there is still the line of of what are you
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:26.140]   willing to give up for the you know for these extra benefits and it's just
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:30.300]   gonna be some give and take it is a market there'll be a market for these
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.620]   things and we'll see how it works out but there's all kinds of new services to
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:40.340]   envision but publishing is stuck in trying to pay for what they always did
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.940]   and actually I would argue I think Stacy the larger point you're raising to is
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:49.660]   that Google and Facebook are also stuck in the old ad market and the
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:55.060]   attention-based ad market and they haven't really started to reimagine that
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:00.900]   kind of service and that kind of middle role in marketing and they're still
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:06.820]   selling attention they I think I'm sure they know what's coming
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.580]   they know it's coming they're working on it that's why you see their deals to
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:16.620]   buy all kinds of like more data and hardware deals like the Fitbit deal I
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.020]   think like getting that context they're trying to build up their
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:25.300]   understanding of people's context and surroundings self-driving
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:31.260]   those services yeah self-driving cars right so you're gonna sit in R&B
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.020]   entertained I'm gonna take you somewhere draw for us paint for us a
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.740]   picture and doesn't have to be you Jeff it but certainly you have an
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.980]   opinion but everybody in this whatever it is I'm sure I do in this world where
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:48.140]   Google's doing this some sort of differential privacy Apple saying you
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:55.660]   know as kind of an absolutist on privacy most users now Corey Dr. O'Call's at the
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.660]   largest consumer boycott in the history of the world most users many users are
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.100]   running ad blockers privacy blockers what is what are the consequences of
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:10.100]   this kind of privacy focused world I mean this is the world we're gonna have
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:17.540]   so it's not like you could at this point advocate for anything else what are the
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:20.540]   what are the all that you start to know you've been thinking about this what is
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:25.700]   the one who wants just this you want you to have a vault of your data and that
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.460]   you can choose whether to negotiate with somebody you can say what's the
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.340]   consequence what's the con I'm asking about the consequence does do all the
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:42.300]   small town papers go out of business yeah that means local news is no longer
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.700]   collected the nobody's gonna know it doesn't mean that at all it means there's
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:50.260]   new ways to do it go ahead to Stacy what do you think Stacy you go well I don't
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.780]   think that's actually what's gonna happen because it's too much work for
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.300]   consumers I think what's more likely to happen and but if I follow your thought
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:05.260]   experiment one of the losses will be things like a greater understanding of
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:10.540]   population so if you think about like pulling together algorithms or AI you
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:17.020]   know to understand health outcomes right soliciting me I trust the system I'll
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:22.020]   give you my data like so then that influences the algorithm but think about
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.900]   people who may not trust the system they're not gonna give it that's gonna
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:31.380]   influence it again so I think there's a loss associated with some of this at
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:36.500]   different levels I don't think people are prepared for the minutiae of
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:42.580]   information that is collected about them to go places like for a split second in
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:49.340]   time you know an advertiser might care that I went to I don't know my local
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:54.260]   bakery but they're not gonna care about that forever and right now this is built
[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:58.740]   on the free flow of information when that comes to be a decision point we're
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:05.180]   gonna have we're not gonna have as much we won't have advertising in certain
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.660]   ways but we also you know you'll have to convince people of the value of a
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.100]   service like ways right and it'll be interesting to see who can build
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:18.380]   services because a lot of people build services that they can't afford early
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:24.340]   on with advertising dollars sometimes they never give it up but you know
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:29.260]   sometimes they do so there there's but I don't think we're ever gonna get there
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:35.020]   so do do podcasts pick up the slack does who picks up the slack for the oh there
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.740]   was this great article on one zero oh sorry aunt you go no no you had said
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:46.180]   something and then we'll give it a chance don't don't talk about news new
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:49.940]   local news going to next door did you read this Jeff I thought of you when I
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:55.380]   saw it's all about people but the problem is next door is a platform only
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.700]   for people actually live in a certain area so people can't if you were outside
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:03.100]   that area you can't join and refute arguments made is kind of one of that
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:08.260]   but I met with them trying to bring in newspapers into next door but they
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.580]   kind of they're suspicious of other brands this is a Will O'Rameis's article
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.740]   from yesterday next door is quietly replacing the small town paper while
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.020]   Facebook and Twitter get the scrutiny next door is reshaping politics one
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:25.820]   neighborhood at a time certainly next door does have that information but it's
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:30.340]   written by your neighbors right it's not written by yes there's there's there's
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.460]   there's the stuff you could imagine in there there's things that are wrong my
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.820]   wife has gotten this one guy kicked off a next door about three times that's
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.780]   these are my half with this is it's sometimes that neighborhood is not
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:48.020]   quite the sharpest group you know I think let me just say that I'll think
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:53.020]   back to the one of the neighborhoods that I lived in years ago and all of the
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.620]   horrendous information that they would share amongst themselves and it would
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.980]   eventually come back to me because I didn't want to associate with some of
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:05.700]   the idiocy and this right here it I get their approach of trying to keep local
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:10.460]   news alive because it seems like local news is starting to sort of fade away but
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:15.260]   if you just putting it down to the people and having them being in the
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:20.180]   source I don't think that at all so it sounds like that we should all join next
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:26.220]   door to fix it though right I mean if you you can only fix it in the small area
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:31.900]   where you live so if my neighborhood's cool but there's some flaming racists the
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:36.780]   next neighborhood over and there are more of them making decisions that affect me
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:41.420]   as a whole community then and they're like spouting their conspiracy theories
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:46.380]   over there I have no way to know it or in no way to refute it or go in and do
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.700]   anything about it I mean it's the same issue like you know India has had this
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.660]   issue with misinformation spreading on WhatsApp and they were like screw it
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:59.660]   we're gonna just not let you go on WhatsApp so I mean I can't play how many
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:05.260]   times about well you can't I can't help the people not next door they're gonna
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.340]   have to work on their own issues but shouldn't I participate in my next door
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:14.060]   as a good neighbor yeah because they asked questions like I started my next
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:19.180]   door group after Hurricane Sandy and okay we needed to find out things together
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.660]   we needed to share things together was a platform that was built for that and
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.820]   it's verified identity so they're truly my neighbors but the problem was they
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.580]   said you have to have like 72 neighbors well I live on three-acre zony now to
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.260]   hear in the country I said to get some of you people I've got people who are
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:38.220]   five miles away I don't know who they are right but they kind of did it anyway
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.060]   they have I have a little old neighborhood but now they've spread it out
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:46.460]   to get enough traffic they have the next two towns over so somebody's I care
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.300]   about something I don't care about but it's it's another input like LinkedIn is
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.420]   not my whole life but occasionally LinkedIn is useful occasionally next door
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:58.380]   is useful you know but let's write though occasionally also my neighbors are
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.020]   real dorks you know I just signed up for next door in my neighborhood and this
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:07.820]   is the first thing I see is a good neighbor pledge to be helpful do not
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.020]   discriminate we do not tolerate racist and worse counts that's the same
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:16.540]   terms of service no one there no one ever reads okay so but but honestly by
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:20.700]   doing this and having community guidelines they could clean it up I mean
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:24.300]   you've sat you know the store is the home of racist people and next door
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.980]   moderators are normal people who live in your neighborhood yeah it's almost
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:34.940]   like you don't want to really realize who's living near you it's like it's
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:43.500]   yeah go on now you were asking for us to paint a picture in my picture
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:47.820]   part of it I see just a bunch of silos and
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:52.220]   one side of me likes things being sort of siloed off and just because I'm
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:56.380]   introverted and sort of like to keep away from myself but at the same time it's
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.820]   not good to have things siloed off where people aren't able to get
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:04.220]   good valuable information and this whole next door thing
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:08.060]   let me give you my perspective I'm the new guy here you know the perverts we're
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.700]   the new new people here in this particular
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:14.700]   neighborhood and we were told about next door
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:20.780]   logged in and got verified yada yada yada and oh my goodness I couldn't do it
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.340]   I couldn't stay in there I couldn't read through it it was a racist
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:29.260]   well it's not racist stuff but it's just a lot of people that just doesn't have
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.380]   they don't have a lot of common sense with some of the stuff that I've seen
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:36.300]   but yet if I walk outside physically walk outside my front door and look at my
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.060]   neighbor to the left absolutely loved them I have the best
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.860]   neighbors in the world I mean they made me shepherd's pie last week
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:50.860]   oh you know that's that's really sweet so next door doesn't really show
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:55.180]   that part next door is showing me all this other underbelly that I
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:00.540]   I won't know part of yeah I'm looking at my next door now that I signed up
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.660]   and it's all pretty good like how much rain did you get
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:08.620]   hey here's a guy's doing irrigation somebody wants to know hey I want to
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:12.780]   donate my body to science 63 comments from that's awesome
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:17.900]   explaining how to do that where do I get a vaccine
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.540]   stuff like that oh scroll down on your vaccine see how many anti-vaxxers pop
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:26.620]   oh that's good that's here 73 comments does anybody know anything
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:30.460]   about vaccines now how do I I'm trying to see the comments
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:34.460]   how do I see that okay I'm in mine so the same thing well it says see
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.780]   previous 44 comments or whatever yeah but I'm clicking it nothing
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.020]   oh so there it is see so Stacey in mine oh there they are
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:47.340]   oh boy let's see if we get any anti-vaccine mine is entirely about the details of
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.900]   getting it that's great it's not and about I haven't
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.980]   seen anybody yet vaccine update here's where you go
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:01.420]   if you're over 75 here's this oh I got one I got one I got one
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:06.140]   yeah I'm in Northern California I'm in Northern California
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:10.220]   I'm not gonna probably get a lot of it what happens is you get a bunch of people
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:14.300]   too I know you're in Rona Park that's a very different town the
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:20.380]   betaloma you you get I should have warned you about that aunt
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:23.740]   no I'm just teasing um you get a bunch of people who are
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:27.420]   normal people and then you get the one person who's not normal
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:30.700]   and then other people try to engage and they double down being extra
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.180]   awful and anytime someone's a jerk you notice it way more than you do
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.780]   someone who's like a nurse so my premise that everybody you know
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.300]   that the good people should participate join and drown out the bad people
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.980]   that is that a false premise no I think I mean I think that's fine
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:49.500]   information yeah yeah I'm just saying that
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:55.740]   go that way in Austin my next door would start with I mean in
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:00.140]   granted we would we would go to it for much entertainment like especially
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:04.220]   around Halloween in appropriate decorations came out
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:09.660]   um but you you also did like you know there was definitely people in again
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.700]   this was two years ago but they were like letting you know
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.580]   there's a black man in a hoodie walking down the street yeah
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.940]   yeah that neighborhood had that problem big time
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:24.140]   that was a really doorbell thing yeah and and sometimes you know or
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:29.820]   someone will say something you know borderline or I mean this happened to
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.420]   Texas people would you know the lawn signs for various politicians
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:38.140]   that was always it gets heated but most of the time yes it's it's very like oh
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.580]   hey I've got I've got two meetings with kitties anyone
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.620]   why yeah come get them okay I went through the whole vaccine
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:48.220]   thread not one person said oh don't do that it'll kill you or anything like
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.980]   that it's all like here's how you do it whereas
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.300]   it was very helpful stuff so maybe I just a little better neighborhood than you
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:57.660]   do I don't know yeah you do because I logged in and the first thing that I
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.300]   saw was something quite nice and then the second thing
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.420]   says just move on I've come to realize you can
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.460]   you can't just block annoying people and move on
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:09.740]   you know it's that extreme does it have blocking
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:14.300]   uh it really looks like a form I mean again they actually
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.580]   this is my wife has gotten this one guy out I think he's out permanently now
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.180]   because there was three strikes yeah um and he was being a jerk and she
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:24.220]   and she reported him and they did something well we have bad neighbors
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:26.620]   I mean it's not that we don't have oh lord knows yeah I don't need the
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:29.020]   internet to have my bad neighbors they've been bad for long before the
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:31.820]   internet sometimes people get blocked for like
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:35.740]   teasing people you know like next door isn't a forum for teasing people but
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:38.460]   man sometimes people just you know and I can
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.900]   there's no irony on that did yeah so you gotta
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:47.260]   you gotta know your audience huh I don't know okay all right all right
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:50.140]   yeah we gotta do something okay hey speaking of the ring doorbell do you
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.380]   see they have a new guy this is a good one for you Stacey
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:57.660]   they have a new $60 entry level doorbell and the way they save money is they
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:01.340]   don't put a battery in it but I have a wired doorbell I don't know if most
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:04.060]   people do but I think that's not uncommon
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:08.460]   it's not uncommon it's super easy y'all you don't eat okay I
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.020]   well I'm not gonna tell you this that would be responsible I was like
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.500]   most of the time you don't even have to turn off the power to do a doorbell
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.540]   because yeah because it's not it's low voltage but you still should
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:20.220]   probably I okay I did like somebody's gonna have normal
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:24.060]   yeah they're gonna be blasted yeah shooting nasty grams for Stacey
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:28.620]   Higambotam no but so you know what turn off your power to be safe yeah
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:33.500]   a lot of times so I put it in um uh the rundown I put in Stacey's uh
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.940]   four bears did you see that one you've watched this video we have a
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.220]   wait let's just finish up on this okay oh I'm sorry I think we're done oh
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:45.820]   well I don't know oh okay I don't know uh oh democracy sorry
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:49.020]   yeah just let me let's finish one before we go to the next one how about
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.020]   that I thought you were done with that one I was okay never
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.460]   what did I raise my hand and say anybody I apologize anybody else I just
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:58.220]   wanted to ask you I apologize already I think this is a good this is a good
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:02.620]   doorbell I'm not gonna steal ants they are we scared of uh are we scared of
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:09.740]   are we scared of Amazon in the ring or is that I I don't like I mean this is
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:12.300]   super cheap and the reason why I think is because
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:17.580]   WISE has a doorbell right too um so we're seeing prices get lower good
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:21.180]   you know I don't like ring simply because I don't want to pay a
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:26.300]   subscription to get access to my feed right and that's that's by the way
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.780]   which is what is that cost the subscription to get your data
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:35.740]   well is it's to see videos after a certain amount of time that's very fast
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.940]   like if you don't catch it in the first two hours you're done
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.140]   what I'm asking Stacey is that is that their primary or they're a secondary
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:45.020]   revenue stream is this about so is this the long
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.660]   call is this about subscription money or is it still harder this is about
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:52.060]   sustainability for a connected device so you know you can sell it on hardware
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:56.620]   and your margins are probably okay I might well they're less on a 60 dollar
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:00.060]   if you have one ring doorbell or security camera three dollars a month
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:06.140]   thirty dollars annually if you want to have more than one
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:09.740]   then it goes up you could have as many as you want for ten dollars a month a
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.340]   hundred dollars annually so it's actually a better deal than the nest
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:19.020]   nest protect it's not that expensive and for free you get ring and motion alerts
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:22.700]   current the custom motion detection
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.940]   interacts what you don't get is you get your live video on demand
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:29.980]   but you can go back to that thing so I can see what their
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:34.140]   plan is you get 30 to 60 days if you pay for it you get no
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:38.700]   recordings if you don't right so basically if you miss that person at your doorbell
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.300]   you can't see them steal in your package right
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:46.060]   and for the hundred dollars annually you get monitor professional monitoring as
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:49.980]   well which is any idea what proportion subscribe
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:53.020]   I have been trying to get that data forever oh but what I was thinking about
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:56.460]   sustainability is when you have a connected product you're constantly
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.540]   having to pay to update it with like security updates the software associated
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:04.220]   with it and then the cloud costs associated with the video going to the
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.820]   cloud and getting stored is just constantly accruing so
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.580]   that's why connected project products always try to have a subscription plan
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:16.060]   because you can't pay for them all up front because the costs accumulate
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:20.140]   over time the wise camera is not yet available but it's
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:24.380]   uh it's out it's half the price is 30 dollars
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:29.340]   right and it's local so it it has both cloud and you can pop an SD card in it
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.300]   yeah that's a nice thing then you don't have to pay any subscription with the
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.820]   SD card they do also have an optional subscription
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:38.700]   though don't they I believe yes yes they do yeah you can get home
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:42.060]   monitoring and all and all of that but people did not like the 30 dollar
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:45.500]   wise video doorbell I did not test it because oh interesting
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.740]   I know for testing doorbell so the basic plan which is free with
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:53.180]   all devices for wise again the 30 dollar camera
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.700]   and john said he he's is on his way so we'll ask john when you get yours how
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:01.740]   how you like it tomorrow 12 second video events five-minute cool down period
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:06.380]   motion triggered but no face detection pet detection
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.940]   and it sounds it looks like if you're going to do recording you have to do it
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:12.380]   yourself cam plus which is cheap it's a buck 25 a month
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:17.420]   when you buy a year gives you vehicle detection package detection
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:21.580]   uh fast forwarding through events you can record events so
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:25.660]   wise is really making their name in the business by completely undercutting
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:29.340]   the big guys and I love seeing it bring prices down
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.860]   even for the big guys so that's you're right I think it's this is wise
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:36.620]   this is the response to the wires yeah yeah
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:41.660]   um okay now we can move on jeff we well no no no no no I don't want to know
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.540]   it's still nevermind
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:47.260]   start a democracy you picked
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:51.740]   no it is and I wait no it's one of the reasons that from time to time I'll say
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.780]   is there anything you guys would like to talk no but I just you're being forced
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:58.300]   to do it I don't want you to be no no no no no no no no you pick up this looks
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:04.060]   like a story you put in here google play bands video app for standard
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:08.780]   dot ask subtitle report did I how did I know
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.980]   so was what a s s stands for advanced substation
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:16.060]   alpha files it is not a naughty word for the butthocks
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:20.860]   area but google of course you know when they were coming up with that standard
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.060]   they were like let's call it ass
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:32.300]   okay so the alternative is srt correct there's a variety I think of these for
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.900]   these subtitles yeah I think srt there's there's others like
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:44.940]   ass like ass ass like uh s s sa uh which is yeah
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:48.620]   sub substation alpha and then there's advanced substation alpha
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:53.740]   which really should be asha but you know and then you're right srt
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:59.820]   ttml vtt there's quite a few of them reminds me of a great sign filled
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:04.060]   which man license plates oh yeah that's right
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:09.900]   that idea lunes balloon has popped have we done this story
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.580]   nope it's all the air going out sunday yeah I taught it's the problem is I have
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:20.220]   different shows and different calendar so uh astroteller best name ever
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.180]   the man who runs the x google's x they're uh they're uh they're uh what do they
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:33.340]   call the moonshots or other bets uh he says it's not a failure
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.740]   it's not a failure we've we've learned uh these are the balloons that we're
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:44.380]   going to provide 4g internet access anywhere in the globe
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:49.260]   remember uh uh facebook had their own version of this these drones called
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:54.460]   achila drones which they killed about a year ago a while ago yeah
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:30:01.420]   lune was founded in 2011 um and it was used it's been used in a number of ways
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:04.620]   it was used in in peru after i think an earthquake
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:09.180]   it was used after hurricane maria and portarico in 2017
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:15.180]   um they have uh been using it in kenya they as a commercial service
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:21.260]   for lte 35 balloons covering a 50 000 square kilometer area over the city of
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:26.380]   nairobi uh so but it was never going to turn a profit
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:31.340]   and i have to think that things like elon musk starlink uh which was
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.700]   which is going to use satellites to do the same thing actual full internet
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:40.300]   not just lte maybe each one eat is lunch right yeah maybe
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.660]   oh is that it oh okay you got two competitors in that field yeah
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:45.100]   with yeah basos
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:53.100]   and the balloons were expensive 10 000 tens of thousands of thousands
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.060]   of dollars and they died after five months yeah
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.940]   um in people who were in this pocket change for google
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:02.300]   yeah but they yeah but not or not under roof poor it yeah they don't want to
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:04.540]   spend the pocket change they want to keep it
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:08.220]   they said yeah a hundred million a year that it was it was losing a hundred
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.100]   million dollars a year there was also there were apparently
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:16.700]   regulatory hurdles um there's always yeah so why do they do it in the first place
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:20.780]   well because providing broadband to places that don't have broadband is a
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:24.300]   public good oh it's not about all it's not always about
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:28.700]   the privileged people you know but i you know this is not one of
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:31.500]   them to succeed but was this a bad business plan could
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:36.060]   if it's bad now then why wasn't it bad nine years ago is what i'm just trying
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.220]   to do it was but they they were trying to get
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:42.140]   i mean the hope was that they would come up with some way to build
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:45.740]   economies of scale so maybe the balloons would get cheaper over time
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.780]   maybe governments would help fund it to bring
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:53.100]   you know and that just does it still important work it's still vital and it's
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.260]   still good for their business the more people they can get on the internet
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.500]   it's it's gods work all around well and Stephen Levy got
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.300]   talked to astra teller about it and uh teller said look this is this is
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:08.700]   he said it's not a failure it's a successful experiment
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:11.580]   leave he says i asked him what an unsuccessful experiment might like
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:17.500]   might look like real failure is now real failure says astrotalers when the
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.740]   data tells you what you're doing isn't the right thing and you do it anyway
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.740]   it's a right you know it's his version of uh insanity is doing the same thing
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.060]   over and over and expecting a different result
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:32.460]   i love that response yeah you know you all talked about that sunday i believe
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:36.620]   it was that's right lance and yeah that brought it up and and it makes
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:41.100]   perfect sense it you look at a lot of businesses heck you can just look at
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:45.260]   uh production people to produce shows and podcasts and things like that after
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:48.780]   a while you know you see a certain way of your content is not really
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:52.060]   growing you say okay i need to pivot you don't just
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:58.060]   believe in yourself my wife lisa loport is the roost pore out of twit
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:03.580]   and yet we're still on the air and we're still crushing it yeah
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:07.020]   no but uh you know and i'd appreciate it admire it because i will never get
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:11.100]   rid of anything i will do a show forever but if it costs us money to do it
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:15.580]   something right now huh are you trying to tell us something
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.260]   we have sponsors gotta blame lisa for it is that it
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:23.180]   yeah it's lisa so the other thing that i thought was interesting this is steve
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.820]   from steve and leave he's uh story unwired
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:30.940]   is that when lune was started internet availability was 75 percent of the
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:35.340]   world now it's 93 percent of the world really
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:40.140]   yeah and satellite um or you had just finally people
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:44.140]   wiring up the world global and then the remaining areas leave he says are
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:47.260]   primarily populated by either those who can't afford
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.700]   the forg phones lune requires or aren't convinced that the internet
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:57.420]   is worth the effort there are the six percent like even at the event
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:02.780]   deniers yeah well no they just so here's one
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.980]   there's a large portion who just don't have computers right so that that was
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:07.980]   why they didn't get on they didn't see the point
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:12.460]   in it right there was actually like one or two percent who were very focused on
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:16.700]   porn um they were just like that is how porn gets into your house
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.700]   oh they want the forecast on keeping it out oh
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.780]   yeah sorry this is why they don't have it
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:24.620]   it's not to get the opposite
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:28.700]   and in the rest we're just like you know it just it may no sense that a lot of
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:33.500]   these people were older um some people had it at the office and felt like
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:38.380]   that was sufficient i mean there's nugs and nugs who aren't on the
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:43.100]   internet you know i think there are days when i wish i weren't on
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:45.580]   the internet
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:49.980]   yeah there they were just the internet was i were both of it is what do you say
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:53.420]   is like 90 how much 93 coverage now
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:57.900]   in uh that's amazing it did make that that makes me think about my sister
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.060]   my youngest boy i'm trying to think how it is
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.260]   all right so it's been at least 10 years that my sister in south carolina
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:09.900]   her residents didn't have internet access just just didn't have it they just
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:13.980]   got it about two weeks ago they just got wow out there
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:18.860]   for about 10 years no internet now i have no reason why google killed
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:22.220]   tilt brush this was i didn't know what the heck tilt
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:27.180]   bronze it was one of the best vr painting games
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:32.700]   that four people played well and now it's open source yeah at least that's
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.580]   you know what i got i got a praise in for doing that
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:40.460]   that's the way if you can uh to to kill any software project
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:45.740]   open source it let me reader reader yeah i wish they'd done a
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.540]   centering reader ages ago or wave you know open source it because
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.020]   if you know it an open source project doesn't have this have to have the same
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:59.020]   metrics as a commercial project by google to survive and
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.820]   right i bet you anyway we'll see you know what we'll watch and see what
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:05.580]   happens with tilt brush this is an example though of google product google
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:11.500]   bought in 2015 praising its innovative approach to 3d painting
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.100]   it even had tilt brush artists in residence
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:21.180]   but Ruth poor at it's been poor added can we use that as a verb
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.220]   it's been poor added i don't even know if it was Ruth but uh

[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:27.340]   actor wife who chartered a private plane
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:30.620]   to a remote community near the alaska border

[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:37.420]   lord

[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:40.700]   uh
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:44.860]   the tribes up here there's a tribe actually on the peninsula that actually
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:47.980]   they had too many doses they they vaccinated the tribes and then they were
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:51.420]   like opened it up to the community and this was not that this was not that
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.740]   ronnie and ekatrina baker traveled by charter plane to beaver creek a community
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:39:00.460]   of a hundred in the yukon territory a mobile team was administering the
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:05.260]   mo dana more dana vaccine to residents uh particularly elderly members of the
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:09.500]   white river first nation at the mobile clinic the bakers claim to be workers
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.860]   at a local motel
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:18.380]   oh it's son of a but then they asked for a ride back to the airport
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:24.460]   unbelievable they called the motel and they said no they don't they don't work
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:30.460]   work for us so uh enforcement officers that's what they call the mouties in
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:34.060]   canada enforcement officers searched a couple
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:37.260]   searched for the couple at their quarantine location and white horse
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.580]   found they'd already left they were discovered at the airport
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:44.460]   preparing to fly back to vancouver they were both fined for breaking public health
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.420]   rules but they didn't do any jail time but they had shots
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:52.220]   they got 500 bucks fine big deal did they get the lance yeah they got the
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:57.500]   shots so it was worth it for them so you're trying to sign up for it you have
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.660]   to be just the right minute and then i saw them and i thought okay i'll
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.220]   talk i took it and i went back a minute later all all the
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.660]   signups were gone so now i've got to worry about getting the second
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:12.380]   appointment because there's no times in there i went to the fire academy and
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:15.260]   i was very well run by middle slex county
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:20.700]   um it was i've got to say that one thing that disturbed me was that it was
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:23.980]   almost entirely white
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:27.900]   yeah because you have to sign up on a freaking app or a computer in most
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.940]   yeah that's not right you have to have the time to sit here and he's just not
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.980]   right you're absolutely right no it's not you know why i'm
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:37.900]   feeling funny about having gotten it uh there are teachers there are bus
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:40.860]   drivers there are grocery store people you know who
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:45.020]   there should have been prioritized in that way it wasn't and so i got a time
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.820]   and i got it uh and i am vulnerable and so
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:52.220]   fine but uh there should have been prioritized against people who
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:57.180]   um are exposed and vulnerable one thing that people are having to fit
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:01.500]   about in new jersey is that you make the current list
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:08.300]   if you smoke oh that's terrible well okay hold on hold on it's a legitimate
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:11.020]   health impact yeah but it's a style choice i don't think
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.140]   you should be rewarded
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.780]   all right okay i knew that would cause a fine
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:24.460]   do we do we do we talk or are you fine i happen to like to i happen on sleep on
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.380]   a bed of nails every night can i get the vaccine
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.020]   i might get it you know that could be that could be a health
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:34.460]   if you take that line of thinking then what you're going to start doing is
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:37.980]   demonizing people who make unhealthy choices and not everybody makes unhealthy
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:42.540]   choices because they're i know i have a family member it's a fascinating
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:44.620]   debate smokes and it makes me mad
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:52.220]   also asking someone to give up smoking in the middle of the freaking pandemic
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:57.740]   that's right i took up smoking are you kidding i got myself i got myself a hook
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:01.820]   a trigger yes that's the smoking i took up i got a
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:04.860]   trigger i smoke your brisket i smoke your ribs
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:12.300]   get a trigger forever yeah i wonder if i get in line on a very
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.420]   effective vaccine i smoke i smoke i got a trigger i it's a
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:19.980]   pellet i know it's not really a wood smoker but i smoke i'm a smoker all
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:23.260]   right i'm a smoker
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:33.420]   susan mojiski her first letter of 2021 addressing youtube's priorities for the year
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:41.020]   um let's see here's i go ahead
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:45.660]   go ahead i forgot what she wants to grow the creator economy okay
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:49.900]   she says this is actually amazing according to oxford economics
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:56.620]   youtube's creative ecosystem contributed 16 billion 16 billion to the united
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:03.100]   states gdp in 2019 340 000 the equivalent of
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:10.940]   345 000 full-time jobs the uk 1.4 billion pounds the equivalent of 30 000 full-time
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:13.740]   jobs in france five hundred fifteen million
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:18.780]   euros 15 000 full-time jobs so you know this is these are the same kind of
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:22.540]   stats apple says about their app store about how many you know people are
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.900]   employed by it but yeah i mean it has it has an impact
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.380]   you're fine you're gonna want to wait tomorrow a lot of people have problems
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.500]   yeah um
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:37.100]   sorry stacey oh no i was just like i'm feeling very cynical about PR today
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:42.220]   yeah me too always am always like uh
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:46.540]   um i guess that's the the main you want us you want a facebook story
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:49.420]   hold on uh yes we we have actually some big ones but before
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.620]   i'm just scanning scanning through the letter because i forgot i had
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:54.780]   bookmarked some stuff but i forgot what it was
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:59.900]   um now we turn our focus to the possibilities ahead with vaccination
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.900]   in october we expanded our covid 19 medical misinformation policy on youtube to
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.580]   remove content about vaccines that contradicts consensus from health
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:12.220]   authorities in other words anti-vax stuff i think there is
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:18.140]   absolutely a burden on places like facebook twitter and and youtube to
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.660]   make sure that uh they because one of the biggest problems is
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:25.020]   going to be you know as we slowly work through this supply
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:31.420]   issue uh is going to be vaccine deniers vaccine yes yes uh you know uh
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:34.940]   or doubters doubters who aren't going to get the vaccine and and it will keep us
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:38.140]   from getting to that critical 75 to 80 percent
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:41.980]   for herd immunity uh so i think it's appropriate that there be kind of a
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:46.220]   drum beat of you know it doesn't have to be aggressive or uh you know it's not
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:49.980]   about banning it's about just this kind of generalized drum beat of it's good
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.020]   you got to do it it's safe please you know it's going to help so it's a
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:55.980]   fascinating thing to leo i i asked this with
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:45:00.140]   with journalism right if if there are a large number of people in this country
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:04.860]   who refuse to wear and even burn masks i take that as a failure of journalism
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:08.220]   now if you play that out that says the job of journalism shouldn't be
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:13.180]   convinced you to wear a mask and so am i an educator my a propagandist i don't
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:17.660]   know if journalism should be an advocacy forum oh i think i think in this case
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.900]   the science is clear and if if you don't know the value of a mask if you're
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:25.900]   ignorant to it we failed we failed well you know i got
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:29.740]   knows i uh intentionally very visibly wear a mask
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:33.500]   when i'm coming into the studio i've blocked written many blog posts about
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:38.540]   masks kind of promoted early on the my own you know homemade masks and that
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:42.300]   kind of thing all with it was my intent to subtly
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:46.060]   reinforce the notion that masks are good masks are safe
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:50.060]   masks are positive you know uh it's a good thing
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:54.780]   but um that i don't feel like that's advocacy as much and i don't feel like
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:58.860]   i'm a journalist as much as a uh opinionist opinion person i'm
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.660]   upon this also youtube is making a decision here which i think is the right
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:05.260]   decision it's an advocacy position it's a judgmental decision
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:08.540]   but i think it's the right one to say we're gonna get rid of this stuff that we
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:12.300]   say is wrong and we're gonna do this yes yes i think i agree
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:16.460]   facebook's done the same right yes facebook always gets a lot of heat
[01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:20.220]   because they aren't they it's so big it's hard for them to be completely
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:24.140]   perfect in this but i think they've made i was generous of you
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:31.420]   uh they they have uh referred the trump case in the oversight to the oversight
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:36.060]   board the oversight board has accepted it this is clearly what the oversight
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:39.180]   board was designed to do how long is that going to take though jeff it's
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:42.060]   nighty day up tonight eight days i talked i talked to the people of facebook
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:46.780]   beforehand um and they have um up to 90 days to do it
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:50.540]   facebook could have made it a rush but they didn't want to rush this decision
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:54.460]   it is by the decision we will be binding in regards to donald trump
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:58.700]   see i'm surprised because i thought that the the oversight board lacks teeth
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:02.300]   but apparently it does have the teeth oh no no this is binding in terms of if
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.660]   if if oversight board says you were wrong to take down trump put them back up
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:09.740]   they will put them back up okay um now clearly this has implications
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:12.780]   again it's just it's restricted to the case of Donald trump
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:17.660]   but clearly the discussion goes on to you know duteraté and and and and
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:21.820]   right you have the hunta have uh me and marv all that
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:25.740]   yeah well i so i got called from a london journalist doing a story about
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:29.500]   how there's an activist trying to get the kobe knee down
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.460]   because of human rights violations so you're going to find this in all those
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:35.660]   places at the same time you have miracle and
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:41.180]   macrall saying oh uh twitter should have taken down ahead of state no we might
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:46.460]   have to you have a law about that poland is now has legislation going through
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.780]   that would forbid the platformers to take down any legal content
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:54.220]   would give them it's the opposite of 230 we give them no choice at all
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.180]   but to keep everything up the people want up there and make them all into
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:01.180]   parlor how's that huh um so we see that there's there's
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:05.340]   i think there's implications to this case it'll be fascinating to see
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:09.660]   whether the oversight board raises this up to a level of principles
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:12.380]   or or not uh we can all make public content
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:18.060]   comment to them if you want to have you know i noticed on twitter the lack of
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:22.460]   president trump's tweets uh actually not just on twitter but also
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:26.940]   in the general national discourse and news yeah uh that that absence has been
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.140]   beneficial have you noticed that on facebook is there
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:33.980]   i didn't at my senses he it wasn't the same on facebook like that wasn't the
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:37.420]   same yeah it wasn't getting quoted the same media but but it was there and you
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:40.780]   could you know you could you can find it but it's not there now but of course
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:45.580]   they didn't take him down entirely they froze his contributions to the
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:48.780]   speaking of youtube they have decided to continue to block
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:53.660]   his videos um they're good this is gonna they're gonna have to make
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:59.900]   a decision at some point because i it's it depends if trump fades away
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:05.020]   i don't think he's going to or if he decides to take the national stage again
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.900]   and become active uh then that's going to be
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:11.980]   interesting to watch if he decided to hold a press conference at mara logan
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.700]   tomorrow uh you know there'd be reporters there i don't know
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.860]   they should be because he's a has been but yeah um you know they'll be there he
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:22.460]   has a voice if he wants it he's not he's not silenced yeah
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:27.740]   any more than josh holly's silence josh yeah you can't you can't be wild
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:31.900]   josh as we went on the air yeah so to speak air quotes around air

[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:18.220]   thing oh it is no you said you had a story oh no jor does work quite much
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:21.980]   so so two things related facebook says it's going to dial down
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:26.140]   politics now because it's just such a pain obviously and and they're gonna
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:29.660]   be politics in general they don't need it that's all dialed down
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:34.060]   same time at the same time line number
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:40.300]   one 16 um political reports that that new campaigns are
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:43.900]   suffering badly because without facebook and twitter and
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:48.060]   being able to put a political ads they don't have a way to reach
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:50.860]   the voters and their peace who they'll figure it out
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:54.780]   that's what the world i mean that's aw they're stuck with their stuck with mass
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:59.180]   media no maybe they can figure something else out maybe they can do door
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:02.380]   knockings maybe they can do a kickstarter for their campaign maybe
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:07.020]   make i agree with you you are still expensive
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:11.500]   yes girl figure it out i mean the reason the reason we have
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:17.820]   i am i am so unsympathetic also this idea that facebook i mean
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:21.580]   maybe they just shouldn't have like the algorithmic reach maybe they should
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:24.700]   just let people post i mean i know that's their whole business but
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:27.660]   it's kind of like maybe this is acknowledging that their business
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:32.060]   isn't doing the best it can for people and the other option is then what are
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:35.100]   they going to show us it's not our messages from our friends because that
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.580]   doesn't make a money it's going to be stupid
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.900]   instagram gigas and whatnot anyway i'm i'm interested in this fact you know
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:44.940]   newsletters of the hot new hotness right sub stack
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:49.180]   for this week or so yeah well i think there are a lot of people like shanty
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:52.940]   songs i think about you think it's the life of the lifespan of a
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:57.260]   birdie shanty song uh uh i feel like that a lot of people are
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:02.780]   looking at ways to monetize via companies like sub stack twitter has just
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:08.140]   acquired a small uh company called uh from from holland
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:13.180]   called uh review rev ue it's a newsletter platform for writers and
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.780]   publishers that probably didn't cost him much
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:20.860]   there's it's a six person team but it does i think it's telling that
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:25.660]   twitter acquired them i think it'd be very interesting
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:30.140]   uh to see them create a platform for creators involving newsletters
[01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:32.780]   they say it'll work seamlessly with twitter
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:37.020]   twitter says they plan to create new features it'll make it easier for
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.500]   writers to connect with their audiences allowing people to sign up for
[01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.980]   newsletters from people they follow on twitter
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.460]   adding new settings for writers to host conversations with their
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:47.580]   subscribers on twitter i think there's a lot of potential here i think
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:54.140]   that's very interesting agree you agree yes agree agree
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:57:01.340]   twitter is opening up its firehose to researchers this is good news for free
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.420]   good news yeah very good news because i think it's become clear certainly
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:09.900]   was clear in the last four years that twitter is an important resource
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:14.940]   for what's you know kind of the zeitgeist not just on the internet but
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:19.820]   you know just nationally twitter used to require researchers to pay
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:22.700]   for full access instead they're going to make the full history of public
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:27.180]   conversation they refer to it as its full archive search and point available to
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:31.420]   any researcher a developer who applies as part of the launch of a new academic
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:34.540]   research track they're also going to improve the twitter
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:39.900]   api uh you know something that's been a source point
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:45.980]   point with third party developers um to make it easier to do this kind of
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:51.260]   thing so big news big big news uh that's the right thing to do
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:56.540]   twitter is also uh doing a few other interesting things
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:00.300]   one is bird watch which is kind of like
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:05.340]   a forum to combat misinformation it's crowd it's crowd source crowd source
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:09.420]   learning yeah uh bird watch allows people to identify information and
[01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:12.700]   tweets they believe is misleading or false
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:17.020]   you know it's it's one way to you know palm this off on on other people instead
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:20.460]   of having to do it yourself but i mean they're like a forum like an online
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.580]   forum it's kind of like that report you have to apply
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:30.300]   to be a bird watcher um i applied did you good they haven't said yes
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:35.100]   yet twitter says it will be available to a small set of users at first largely
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.220]   on a first come first served basis you don't have to be a high profile
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:43.260]   jeff javis type or a traditional fact checker
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:46.860]   but you will have to have a real phone number and email address okay
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:50.700]   you can if you're a bird watcher you can flag tweets from a drop down menu within
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:56.940]   the twitter interface um but any discussion you start
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:59:00.140]   about the tweet will remain exclusively in the bird watch
[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:02.620]   section
[01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:06.620]   plus people will rate each other's i don't know what they're going to call
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:12.220]   them chirps um uh and so that way we'll get some kind of
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.180]   karma system going i think it's good this is a good experiment
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:18.780]   yeah that is uh we talked a little bit about blue sky
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:22.620]   which is something that jack dorsey talked about last year
[01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:27.900]   as a i don't know federated uh twitter open source federated twitter yeah
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:31.900]   yeah um interesting post i guess this is a
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:36.380]   report yep from uh twitter on the a review of the
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:42.220]   ecosystem uh and you know hired basically researchers to work on this
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.940]   this is this is the report of what this looks like including
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:49.980]   i'm pleased to say gargon gargron who is uh Eugene rochko he's the creator of
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:54.700]   mastodon which is the fetaverse instance uh software that we use at twitter
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:59.580]   you the what verse fetaverse the cheese verse by the way
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:05.180]   you started stacy you get it we do now officially on twitter social call it
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:11.820]   the feta verse with a tea i love it uh this is this paper is good because
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:15.340]   it talks about you know indy web and activity pub and all of the
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:20.380]   you know uh open web protocols and things so i i don't know what twitter is
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:23.660]   going to do with this there's a lot but still
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:26.460]   kicking he has people working on this i think this is i think this could be
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.380]   really this goes back to what i was trying to say earlier i think there's a
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:30.860]   chance for the for twitter to be open source
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:33.900]   and for value to be on top of that yeah we're going to find you the good
[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:37.660]   tweeters we're going to find you the good i'd love it if twitter would become
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:41.100]   a map an instance on ganu social on the social
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:44.140]   uh graph i think that would be a really interesting
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:47.900]   plague then i could on my twitter social feed follow
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:53.180]   twitter uh posts from you know you jeff and stacy and and right that would be
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:57.500]   fantastic it would allow me to have my own server my own control
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:01.900]   not see the general twitter noise but follow the people i'm interested
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:06.300]   i i hope very hopeful they also talked about matrix
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:10.220]   in this which is an open source kind of discourse like
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:15.500]   platform i'm very excited about matrix i think matrix is is really strong
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:20.780]   um there are a number of matrix clients that are end-end encrypted like element
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:26.060]   um it's very interesting so good i'm glad twitter's putting some
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:30.140]   yeah i like that one some effort into this and thanks to jason putting the
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:33.740]   rundown up earlier i saw it at the end of last week and oh like i'll
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:36.540]   forget this yeah that's where we have the rundown
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.300]   yep
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:42.700]   uh all right i think we could quickly do a change log stacy is really running
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:45.420]   out of steam i can tell she's running out of cherries
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:48.940]   problem no i'm so i'm still here i just was getting
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.220]   worried because we were like almost two hours in and we'd only done one ad and
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:56.220]   i was like yeah you were right you were right i was
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:02:01.820]   i was i was i was a lager show hallway go stretching out into eternity
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:08.780]   never earns although uh i think this would be a good time
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:13.260]   to scare jeff with the first item in the google change log
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:20.540]   the google change log yay i'm sure you're familiar jeff with a very useful
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:25.660]   page everybody should know about the google my activity page
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:37.180]   it now has dark as it should as it should this is the place you go to
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:41.100]   monitor your google activity myactivity.google.com
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:45.740]   and it looks so nice in the dark jeff the benefit of dark mode is
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:49.500]   really great when you're on camera because every time you go look at a
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:52.540]   site that's in dark mode your lighting doesn't change but i
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:57.580]   prefer it i'm still blizzing out because the pink or orange no matter what it
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:03.900]   doesn't help laptop closed laptop open google has redesigned
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:08.140]   mobile search on android and ios to be easier to read with dark mode no i'm
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:11.820]   just kidding just teasing it is just cleaner and
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.140]   easier to read uh significant redesign of how search
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:21.100]   looks on mobile so if you you know if you if you say hey that looks different
[02:03:21.100 --> 02:03:27.820]   yes you're right and uh very visual lots lots more of those carousels that
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:34.060]   google loves so much very pretty um which unfortunately the side
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:38.700]   effect of this is fewer results wait what is happening on that page what
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:41.340]   what was that that's three different that's three different uh
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:46.220]   pages but you see yeah and different controls and stuff
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:50.380]   yeah scrambled this is what whales yeah what was that yeah no
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:53.820]   scrambled whales this is more what so if you search for unpack well you see
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:57.980]   the entire first page is taken up with a knowledge card
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:01.180]   uh if you search for running spots in san francisco
[02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:06.060]   you don't get websites you get well i guess you kind of do
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:10.540]   um it's just it's a little different it's a little different
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:14.700]   more cards basically is the answer to that
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:19.180]   uh chrome uh let's see now hides notification content when screen
[02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:24.380]   sharing to keep alerts private thank you thank you very much for
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:27.020]   that because uh i don't use chrome but if i did that would be a
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:29.340]   problem i always have to go in here and turn off
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:33.900]   notifications so you can't see it when lace stays
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:37.820]   stacy's yelling at me it's time for lunch let's go come on hurry hurry
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:42.780]   no she doesn't do that uh it's dinner anyway she has a red
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:46.380]   she has a red button on her desk like trump and she pushes it and cherries
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.660]   arrive it's amazing i want the diet what is it diet was it
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:52.300]   diet pepsi diet coke i want the diet coke
[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:54.860]   you're actually boing boing had something saying that
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:59.180]   a the button was still there b he didn't use the button and c there's another
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:04.140]   button in other places just in case so the button story was apparently all
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:06.540]   blown out of yeah you know they didn't really know
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:09.580]   what the button was it was a couple of reporters who looked at this button
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:13.260]   next to the phone big wooden box presidential seal and said
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:16.700]   we wondered what it was until the president president trump pressed it and
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:20.700]   a butler came in with a diet coke i think he bragged about it too i think he
[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:24.220]   like whoa whoosh this he says everyone gets a little nervous when i press
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:26.700]   that button
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:31.420]   so um according to boing boing
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:37.340]   uh the button actually multiple buttons are apparently back in place but their
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:41.180]   purpose has not been disclosed a white house official unfortunately this is
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:45.100]   from political wouldn't say what biden will use the button for
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:49.100]   the official said i don't have anything for you on that he didn't know probably
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:55.180]   uh according to political biden is a big fan of orange gatorade
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:59.580]   oh god i please don't make an orange gatorade button
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:04.940]   i like that m&m's peanut and it's not looking at my body i respect that
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:08.780]   uh former official said there's also another similar button next to the
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:11.900]   chair by the fireplace but he said trump actually didn't use it much he just
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:15.260]   said the valets are always around he says give me a coke
[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:18.620]   you don't have to you don't need a button for that right you're the leader of the
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:22.940]   free world for crying out loud you don't need a button
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:27.020]   uh google hides notification content oh i said that
[02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:32.220]   chrome os 88 is here but but but but but but but but but but um
[02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:36.780]   smart display like screensaver with google photos and weather
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:40.300]   i don't really need a screensaver on my chrome os
[02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:47.820]   nope but now you can youtube.com is now available as a progressive web app
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:51.580]   i like that just in time for mosey leto announce it's not going to support
[02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:56.140]   progressive web apps those are the those are the web pages you can
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:07:00.620]   download and use offline or you know i have a dedicated
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:05.340]   icon for so if you go to youtube.com and chrome
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:11.100]   you'll see the the circle with a plus in it directly in the omnibox you can
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:16.140]   click it to install the app and uh then you'll get a large red play logo in
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:19.020]   your app launcher for opening youtube in a window
[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:22.060]   it's a it's a chrome-less window no no buttons no
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:27.740]   ui that's nice i'm a big believer in pw ways i i like that idea
[02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:33.260]   yep google lens for android rolling out offline translate capability nice good

[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:41.420]   optimized interface just in time for google not to release a tablet
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:50.540]   and that's your google change law
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:57.100]   jeff wanted you to see this i have a feeling this was from jeff
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:02.780]   this is for stacey westinghouse presents this is stasis the all electric
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:08.940]   home heating cooling appliances hi Betty in all my years with
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:12.140]   westinghouse i've covered some pretty interesting stories
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:16.620]   but here is truly the most wonderful and exciting bitty had a hard time walking
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:21.260]   a straight line on my point i was like i wonder okay never had this
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:24.140]   it was a long lunch you can fast forward anywhere
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:29.180]   it's just longer automatically lower a protective screen
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:34.140]   this is your new fireplace working is really a joy in the food preparation
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:37.260]   center we don't call it a kitchen anymore it's a
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:42.060]   food preparation center here you have a refrigerator that looks like fine
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:45.980]   furniture not really it looks like a refrigerator
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:50.860]   was like on your counter just like a fine furniture
[02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:55.660]   little bit of an exaggeration for convenience the upper unit of the
[02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:59.660]   refrigerator opens from both sides and that's
[02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:02.620]   convenient so you can peek at your friend in the other side
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:07.980]   low are handy spacious refrigerator and freezer drawers
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:11.500]   then too there's the miraculous electronic oven
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:16.940]   that will cook these appetizers in six seconds it's from june and it's only
[02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:19.740]   fifteen hundred dollars
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:25.820]   appetizers that are prepared for recipes kept in this microfilm file
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:29.820]   this looks a lot like my thermo mix
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:34.780]   microfilm though that's a story thousands of recipes are on file here
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:39.260]   and simply by pressing a couple of buttons the recipe of your choice
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:44.860]   appears on the screen why those pairs look beautiful
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:48.060]   why why didn't someone make the recipes for them
[02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:53.660]   uh-huh someday you'll be able to use your telephone to order food brought to
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:58.140]   your door um anyway look there's an exercise by
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:03.180]   so it's the early peloton it is well that is exactly what your
[02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:05.900]   office looks like
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:11.420]   into two separate bedrooms at night during the day the wall slides back
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:15.820]   and this becomes the child's education center okay
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:19.500]   they didn't know about covid but they were ready the Westinghouse
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:24.140]   all electric house in color now in color
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:28.060]   jeff that was your that was your edition i was like that i got it i got it
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:30.940]   it's like it musing i do see i do see i do see i do see
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:35.020]   before it's time yeah clearly it's amazing what the internet has
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:37.420]   changed i mean you had to have a microfilm in the
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:41.900]   reader and a microfilm cash in the basement to do that
[02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:45.180]   um well and was there like a little robot you would tell it what you wanted
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:48.860]   would go get the right microfilm show any of that stuff do you remember
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:51.340]   you're probably old enough from we're going to the library to look at old
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:54.620]   newspapers and you think oh you're on the old one
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:59.580]   yes sure do it's a lot harder than it showed
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:04.860]   even you had yes and are you gonna buy in my school we had one we had one
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:08.300]   reader at my school wow for microfilm wow
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:12.220]   everything else we did have the internet but we still had one room to had microfilm
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:14.860]   over well you got all that microfilm what are you going to do you got it you got to
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:17.820]   have a reader are you going to buy this new sony
[02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:22.060]   Xperia pro phone it's only two thousand five hundred dollars
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:25.660]   in a word hells hells no that's two words
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:29.740]   uh this phone is unique because it has an HDMI
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:34.700]   input which means you can connect it to your sony
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:38.060]   camera and use it as a viewfinder which is kind of cool
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.500]   it's great having a larger monitor like that and especially something that's
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:44.460]   got a great resolution to be able to see
[02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:48.780]   more so from the videographer perspective not necessarily for
[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:52.220]   photography side but that's i love that idea because it's a
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:55.660]   pinch and zoom and all of that you know those those
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:12:00.140]   you can get like a fee well monitor for maybe 150 bucks but the nicer ones
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:03.580]   like the atomos ninja that's a couple hundred bucks and
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:07.100]   you know you you only have that one functionality
[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:10.220]   we're here you at least get a phone out of it but it's still
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:13.180]   too much from my opinion if you're excited about the Westinghouse all
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:17.260]   electric kitchen you'll be very excited about nothing
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:21.740]   the founder of one plus carl pay has started a new company called
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:25.660]   nothing this is not old this is not a joke
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:29.340]   brilliant it's a it's a company about nothing
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:35.020]   seven million dollars in seed funding investors like youtuber kasey nice dad
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:39.260]   wait a minute here we go kasey made enough money that he can invest in
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:43.660]   companies nothing he can invest nothing nice that has been making a killer
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:48.220]   now apparently you only have to have a million to be an
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:51.900]   accredited investor twitch co-founder kevin linden read it
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:56.940]   ceo steve huffman all investing i think they might have made a mistake
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:00.780]   because here's the mission statement nothing's mission
[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:04.140]   is to remove barriers between people and technology
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:08.700]   to create a seamless digital future we believe the best technology is
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:12.060]   beautiful net natural and intuitive to use
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:15.580]   when sufficiently advanced it should fade into the background
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:20.780]   and feel like nothing which is what you're going to get if you invest in
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:25.420]   this company can we short it short it i would short nothing
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:30.620]   gladly now i don't know the mission of iot the home of iot
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:34.300]   nothing is the mission i think it's it yeah ambient intelligence that
[02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:37.980]   delivers what you want when you want nothing else yes i'm all for it
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:43.500]   yeah it's hard though yeah very hard sure company about nothing
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:47.980]   all right poor stacey no no we're still we're still on the
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:51.820]   still have some cherries left okay no the cherries are long gone oh the
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:54.860]   cherries are long gone all right that's why i leave the pits and it takes
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:59.340]   longer to eat them that's my story and then i have something to spit it yeah i'd
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:03.340]   be like sticking with it yeah coming up next it's our picks of
[02:14:03.340 --> 02:14:07.820]   the week this week i'm going to start with stacey's
[02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:12.460]   thing what's your pick of the week this week stace
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:17.260]   oh we're doing it we're there we're there okay we're there this always
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:20.540]   that's this is the tunnel you see that light it's the light at the end of
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:26.220]   the light at the tunnel um my pick is not a thing my pick is something
[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:29.500]   this is kind of silly but i'm doing it anyway y'all we're talking about
[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:33.820]   bridgerton i say go for hilda which is a cartoon on
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:39.180]   netflix for children i'm not gonna lie okay based on a graphic novel
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:44.220]   and my daughter and i who is my daughter is 14 this is for seven-year-olds
[02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:49.660]   it is so low-key it is so nice to have on and it is quite funny
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:54.540]   um and it's basically this finish scottis
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:59.420]   scottish finishers scandinavian town this little girl named hilda lives there
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:06.700]   it pulls from mythologies from the area and there's an elf that likes paperwork
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:12.060]   if you want to test it out as an adult i would say go season one episode seven
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:16.700]   which is legit funny and even if you don't like cartoons
[02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:20.700]   i'm i'm not normally a cartoon fan but i think that if it's a cartoon made in
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:24.460]   finland it's actually canadian oh it's canadian
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:29.180]   canada oh okay so give me the finished kiddo tomorrow
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:35.420]   are you oh yes so yeah i you know what we've at least and i've decided we're
[02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:38.700]   gonna start only watching shows that are happy
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:45.580]   that's why we're watching the fabulous i do it all creatures great and small
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:50.380]   they see hates because she's a grinch
[02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:55.820]   she's a great parent is not my friend but you're right though after you said
[02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:59.660]   in every episode he seemed to be or every it's a novel series of novels that
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:03.660]   became a tv show he seems to be sticking his hand up an animal's orifice
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:07.580]   there's an orifice in everyone and there is you're like every time i'm going
[02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:13.420]   up there's a there goes his hand again so yikes you really ruined it for me to be
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:19.820]   honest with you that's now all you see that's what i see
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:23.500]   all right hilda on netflix if you got netflix watch hilda jeff jarvis has a
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:25.660]   number for actually you got a lot of numbers pick one
[02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:29.020]   anything because i don't know because you know ant in rut alliation might
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:32.460]   steal one from me last week so i you never know
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:36.780]   uh happen uh i could what the hell oh so all right um
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:40.140]   the fall of silicon valley uh let me go to that one
[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:46.300]   oh hell where to go where to go so um silicon valley was already kind of
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:49.500]   falling apart before the pandemic pandemic says that it's gotten a lot
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:52.780]   worse uh rents are supposedly down 24 percent
[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.020]   year over year that's good that's good local sales tax
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:00.380]   collections are down by more than 40 percent so the town services won't be
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:03.740]   so good okay so they asked people about how their
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:06.620]   companies would go and so on so forth before the pandemic
[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:09.980]   when asked where they wouldn't want to start a company today
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:15.980]   uh a technologist said 41.6 percent in the san francisco bay area
[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:20.300]   after the pandemic 42 percent distributed or remote
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:24.700]   only 28 percent in the san francisco bay area
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:29.020]   so i'm just saying by val fine go move to austin
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:33.020]   see how you like it go i don't care wait a second
[02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:36.380]   there is a legit story on the changelog the scooter x brought up
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:41.020]   that hold up did we talk about google
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:43.740]   this new feature for the electric vehicle owners
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:49.500]   oh i didn't they're planning just ai to plan electric car trips
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:51.820]   and and you you're you have interest in this because you
[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:56.060]   drive an electric car don't you stacy yes i do and this is like a huge
[02:17:56.060 --> 02:18:00.940]   like i am manually like it is such a pain in the
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:05.980]   orifice it the ass protocol so they're going to use
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:09.100]   something that i have just been studying lately so i'm actually very
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:14.220]   interested in this called graph theory to
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:17.340]   saw it's basically a way of solving a puzzle
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:21.180]   the puzzle being i have i'm running out of electricity
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:25.340]   where can i get a charging station that meets my needs within
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:28.940]   the range i have available to you the reason this is a challenge is because
[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:33.340]   your tesla has a certain kind of charger it actually comes with adapters so you
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:36.780]   can use you can use yeah you can use anything
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:41.020]   but most other people can't use tesla chargers because they don't have the
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:46.300]   supercharger dongle and uh so forth so this will only work with
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:50.700]   android auto oh wait a minute i take it back
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:53.660]   it's android automotive that's a different thing than android auto it's
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:56.140]   only going to work on electric vehicles that are using
[02:18:56.140 --> 02:19:02.460]   google's specific automotive operating system aka not your tesla
[02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:08.140]   yeah that basically means you're either using a Volvo or a Volvo
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:12.300]   it's either on the pole start too or the Volvo xc40
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:15.100]   but google says more cars are going to do that
[02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:18.860]   uh you know i just put it in a maps i mean my god people yeah put it in maps that
[02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:23.100]   makes more sense i have the uh well i i'm very excited when i get my
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:27.740]   mochi for it has an app and uh you pair it to your car
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:31.580]   when you first get the car and then you just kind of get automated
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:35.500]   payment system at any charge you just pull up plug it in it goes i know you
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:39.420]   you and you don't have to do anything so i'll let you know how that works that's
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:41.020]   going to be what do you get the car over the way
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:45.660]   uh valentine's day they're excited we so we will be all electric
[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:48.700]   because lisa has a a chevy bolt right now which
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:52.220]   is ostensibly her sons who still doesn't have a driver's license he's 18 i don't
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.900]   know if we're ever going to get rid of that bolt
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:56.140]   but that's all right we like it that's what we're driving right now that's our
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:59.820]   single car when i get the uh mochi mustang forward
[02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:04.060]   i'll let you know but that uses the ccs fast charging
[02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:08.140]   uh combined system oh fast is fast it really will
[02:20:08.140 --> 02:20:10.700]   it depends Stacy knows it really depends on
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:14.220]   the uh amperage offered by the you know how many watts you can get from that
[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:18.300]   particular charging station you don't actually want to be too fast that
[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:22.780]   that really can hurt the battery superchargers are usually pretty fast
[02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:26.300]   right half an hour to get half a tank something like that it depends sometimes
[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:29.500]   now like because they've been metering them yeah
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:33.820]   so it's been kind of like uh and it's cold
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:37.100]   so i'll be able to yeah that's right slows it down too
[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:41.020]   i'll be able to use the electrify america chargers those are the ones that
[02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:45.580]   vw had to build as part of its settlement for diesel gate
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:48.060]   oh no it's funny but they're putting in a lot they're
[02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:50.300]   spending a lot of money to put them all over the country i don't be
[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:53.820]   interesting and you probably saw that uh
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:58.620]   president biden wants to uh improve electric infrastructure in the u.s he's
[02:20:58.620 --> 02:21:00.940]   pledged to spend billions of dollars to add
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:04.460]   more than half a million ev stations over the next four years
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:08.300]   so he's also very committed i think the federal fleet will go all electric he's
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:11.980]   very committed to doing this so that i'm excited about that that's gonna be
[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:15.820]   good news yeah okay sorry i i just was like super excited
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:18.220]   when i saw that i was like we didn't talk about it
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:24.060]   yeah as as with most google stories it's not as good as it sounds
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:26.940]   yeah all right but graph theory is very interesting
[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:34.060]   i'm very interested in that uh and do you have a thing for us uh yeah sure
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:41.900]   my first thing is from carolina to norcal
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:47.020]   uh hymen's seafood hush puppy mix or hymen's stone ground yellow grits how did
[02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:49.660]   you get those
[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:54.780]   this new friend mr. troy bawer uh sent the package over to
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:59.340]   that's really nice and that just really really surprised me
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:04.540]   did you miss this did you miss these uh yes it's so good to have grits grits
[02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:09.420]   are hard to find around good grits because not just yellow cornmeal
[02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:13.740]   right these real legit grits need to cook about half an hour so
[02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:17.500]   oh what is hominy because grits are made from hominy
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:22.460]   corn it's a kind of corn right corn it's like a special corn
[02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:24.460]   it's all corn
[02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:29.980]   corn that field over there that's gonna be grit you know it's funny because
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:35.260]   it's gonna be tortillas it's funny i feel over there
[02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:38.300]   it's gonna be hush because i googled it what is what is
[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:42.860]   hominy and the first thing it says is it's corn
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:48.300]   it's just corn corn corn what is it called hominy
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:50.940]   i don't know i didn't make it up here's the
[02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:53.980]   yeah do you post shrimp and butter and then
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:58.620]   put that on top of your grits because that's i have made shrimp and grits
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:02.060]   that's good um and it's not just buttered it was also
[02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:06.380]   cream and lots of nice spices yeah actually wait a minute
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:09.980]   hominy is not he's made for maize it's made from maize it's not just
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:15.500]   everyday corn it's old corn all right all right in my world is corn
[02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:20.300]   definitely it's just it's indian corn uh indigidist
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:23.340]   made with lye yeah you have to use the lye that's
[02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:26.700]   truth for uh like tortillas too you have to use lye
[02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:30.780]   really yeah it's nixta it's called nixtamalization
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:36.140]   nixta the what nixtamalization it's a common culinary practice it involves
[02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:41.420]   soaking the dried maize kernels in an alkali solution of calcium hydroxenide
[02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:44.620]   hydroxide made from slacked slacked lime
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:49.260]   lye or wood ash nixtamalization loosens the kernels
[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:54.220]   hulls and makes them soft like a bean it also and you've seen hominy in the can
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:56.860]   right it makes it double the size that's why it looks

[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:27.340]   he said that every hero has what he calls an ashes time a time when the hero
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:31.820]   just sits in the kitchen in the ashes by the stove
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:37.420]   and hang in just kind of regenerates so like the phoenix before you rise back
[02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:40.460]   yeah yeah that's all part of the hero's cycle
[02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:43.260]   just it's ashes time that's what i always tell myself

[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:05.820]   uh you're right you use ashes make lie and the reason lie is so widely used in
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:08.700]   so many cuisines is because it's a common byproduct
[02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:11.820]   of cooking you got ashes gotta do something with it
