[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.640]   our one-year anniversary and happy anniversary
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.340]   to our panelists who are still with us, hard to believe.
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.260]   Gina Tripani from Life Hacker and the smarterware.org.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.060]   Gina, it's great to see you once again.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.300]   Time flies, we're having fun.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.580]   I can't believe it's been a year.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.940]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.220]   Amazing, amazing.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.220]   So happy to be here.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.340]   Our most successful show launch today
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.940]   came out of the box with a huge audience
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.340]   and has only gotten stronger.
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.400]   And that's because of people like you and Jeff Jarvis, who
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.800]   is--
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.120]   [WHISTLE]
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   But now we owe AOL money.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.960]   Knock it off.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.440]   Jeff is with Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.480]   He's also professor of journalism at City University
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.160]   of New York in the author of What Would Google Do?
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.640]   Good to see you.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.000]   You're at home today.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.080]   Yeah, I am trying to write both.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.480]   And not doing a very good job of it.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.280]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.240]   It's called Public Parts.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.840]   At least we know that much.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.340]   Yes, we do.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.920]   Also joining us, very happy to have
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.760]   a former Googler, former founder of Jai Koo,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.800]   and now just man about town, Yuri Angstrom.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.760]   Yuri, it's great to see you again.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.160]   Good to see you guys again.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.280]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.560]   And are you kind of just an early stage angel investor now,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.860]   kind of?
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.800]   Is that what you're doing?
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.380]   Yes, that's mostly what I've been up to since I
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.880]   liked Google late last year.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.480]   And I'm also working on something new.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.980]   So--
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.640]   Oh, you guys know it?
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.680]   Unless there's a secret ahead.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.440]   Mobile.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.360]   Something involves mobile again.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.680]   It's price-prey.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760]   Mobile really is what Jai Koo did so well.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   One of the reasons I really liked Jai Koo and was a big fan
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   of it was integration with the Nokia phones.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.040]   It was kind of a Twitter that had all of the features you
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.320]   wished Twitter had.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.800]   You may still wish Twitter had, because it doesn't.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.080]   And did you work on Buzz at all when you were at Google?
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.400]   Because Buzz, it seems a lot like Jai Koo.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.080]   Yeah, so when we arrived at Google, Buzz didn't really exist.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.120]   So you and Petra--
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.200]   That's right, our team.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.720]   And so we were involved.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   I was actually the product manager of something called
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.480]   Activity Streams, which then evolved into Google Buzz.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.640]   Also, Google Profiles.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   I think I was the first product manager of what
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.680]   eventually became known as latitude.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.360]   So all these social products that nowadays have their
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.680]   independent lives in the Google Cloud.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.240]   So you could probably give us some insight into whether there
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.400]   might be Google Me, a Facebook type connection between all
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.240]   of those into one social network.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   Does that seem like something Google's working towards?
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.240]   I hope so.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.280]   He's not going to tell us.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.960]   He's going to be coy, isn't he?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.680]   All right.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.320]   What's a Googler always a Googler?
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   I had to ask--
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.480]   I can't give it all up.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.320]   No, no, no.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.160]   But if they were going to do something like that, Jeff,
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.680]   you help me.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.600]   You're the journalist here.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.400]   Ask him a question.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.640]   If they were to do something like that, what would it look like?
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.160]   It would be like--
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.440]   Nothing.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.760]   He's not going to say a word.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.280]   He's silent.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   He's silent.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.520]   Is that a question for me?
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yes.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.200]   OK, well, so here's my-- if we're
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.800]   going to talk about this in my as well, you know--
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.280]   I guess--
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.920]   I'll tell you why I ask.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.840]   You know that I was one of the people, one of the few thousand
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.920]   people who gave up on Facebook due to privacy issues.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.320]   And I definitely miss it.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.600]   I was just signing in.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.280]   There's a new iPad application called a flip book or something
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.760]   like that.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.400]   Flipboard.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.640]   Flipboard that aggregates your Twitter and your Facebook
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.040]   into a magazine.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.840]   But I feel like I'm missing a leg because I don't have a Facebook.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.760]   I want-- but I don't want to go back to Facebook.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.200]   No desire to go back to Facebook.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.680]   But I want something Facebook-like that I can trust.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.080]   And that's why I'm hoping Google will do something like that.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   Sure.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.720]   Me too.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.360]   I think that what my experience at Google
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.840]   was managing these products was that--
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.040]   and part of what I'm frankly frustrated about
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.280]   is that you see a mobile client, but it's
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.400]   been integrated into Google Maps and this little attitude.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.200]   And we have--
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.400]   would start off as the activity stream equivalent
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.920]   to the Facebook news feed, which sort of has been shoehorned
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.480]   into Gmail.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.760]   And then we have Google profiles that sort of became
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   linked to the Google search property.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.040]   And all of these to the user appeared to be free, distinct,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.880]   separate products that nobody wrote is able to use them.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.360]   Sort of like you can use Facebook as just one coherent
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.280]   whole social product.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.760]   And so that's what I'm frustrated about.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.040]   And that's what I think Google needs to fix.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.360]   Yeah, they've got the pieces, in other words.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.520]   But they haven't joined them all together.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.440]   And I think everybody on this panel,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.160]   certainly I would count myself, are heavy users of all
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.800]   of those pieces.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.760]   I use latitude.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.400]   You're wearing a four square shirt.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   And Gina last week--
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.520]   and I were talking about how Gina had poo-pooed four square
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.680]   for years and now is a four square user.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.520]   MacConvert.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.440]   A convert.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.280]   And I've decided--
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.000]   I'm coming back.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.160]   You're coming back?
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.560]   Yeah, I just was out of the habit.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.480]   That was all.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.440]   I'm seeing Dennis Crowley on Friday morning,
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.400]   so I'd better be on.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.720]   I just hope that it doesn't do anything yet.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.360]   You check in.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   I saw the other day the bakery that I was nearby
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.480]   had a deal for the mayor.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   So you're starting to see little things like that, coupons.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.560]   I think Starbucks gave a buck off frappuccinos
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.280]   for the mayor of the local Starbucks.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.160]   But it seems like there's so much more in that information.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.800]   And I know lots of people are talking to Facebook
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.360]   about making deals for that information.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.040]   Google, for one, is talking to Facebook
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.120]   about integrating Facebook results.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.200]   Location is huge.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.280]   You've known that, Yuri, for years.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.760]   It's like-- it just can't get started.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.200]   So I decided while I continue to use latitude,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.080]   the only real use for me for latitude right now is Google Talk.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.480]   I use--
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.800]   I pipe Google Talk my location into Google Talk,
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.560]   so people know where I am.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.960]   I don't know what else to do with it.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.840]   That's useful.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.000]   If you look at my Google Talk status, it says where I am.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.160]   Well, that's the difference between active and passive.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:34.140]   It's like, I have a lot of
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.200]   understandably there's some concern about that.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.800]   There was a lot of heat over Apple's new iTunes terms of service
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.720]   that says we're going to aggregate information
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.560]   about your location and send that off.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.240]   Google's been doing that for some time.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.640]   And people don't like that idea.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.080]   And yet, there seems like there's so much value in there.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.800]   Yeah, I think actually that we learned that in Jike
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.200]   one that really days because we started off with a passive client
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.040]   that was just active in the background.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.600]   It was only for no key of phones.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.640]   But it did put latitude dance today, which is just, you know,
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.000]   broadcast your location.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.040]   In fact, broadcast a lot of other stuff, too, such as, you know,
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.920]   whether your phone was on silent or if the ringer was on.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.960]   So people would know what your status was,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   whether they could expect you to answer it if they tried to phone.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   So useful.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.520]   Oh, man.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.720]   I just do remember all that stuff.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.480]   I loved it.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.000]   I got a Nokia phone so I could use it.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.400]   That's right.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.920]   I remember.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.360]   Yeah, I loved it.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.800]   One of his 347 phones.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.200]   No, it was my N95.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.560]   I loved that N95.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.400]   But the battery life was about two tablespoons.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.520]   About equivalent to today's.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.400]   Right.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   See, Andrew and we're back to square one with battery life.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.080]   So at the point was, you know, we pretty quickly realized that actually
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.480]   active, as countering true to true to acid sounds, the requirement
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.680]   of making people do some work to check in is actually much more
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.160]   engaging than just passively, you know, following their presence.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.120]   It gives you more control, too.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.640]   Yeah, people, users want it and the data is more valuable.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.560]   If I write, hey, this place has the best croissants in town, that's valuable.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.080]   And Gina and anybody who follows me now has a when they go to that store and they've
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.680]   got and they then they check in and says, oh, by the way, Leo says, try the croissants.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   That's incredible.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.200]   It is a.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.800]   That's a death beacon.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.040]   That's beacon brought to life.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.960]   Yeah, that's what Facebook was trying to do.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   Kind of way it ought to be.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.360]   And but Facebook was doing it without your permission and without your check in.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.600]   They just said, hey, Leo, report just bought, you know, some Viagra.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.560]   Maybe you think you might want to think about it.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.680]   And then Leo report went, what?
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.440]   I didn't give permission to use my picture.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.600]   So that's the reason they shut down.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.000]   Yeah, speaking was a bad idea.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.200]   Began was one of many bad ideas Facebook's had.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.800]   It seems to me, Facebook also like like everybody.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.840]   This is, I think, what's going on.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.040]   Everybody sees the power and the value of this.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.560]   Facebook was willing to just say, okay, we're going to do it.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.920]   We're just going to go ahead and integrate it.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.800]   And its users went, oh, man, what are you doing?
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.280]   And there was a big backlash.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.960]   And now everybody, including Google is saying, we better, you know, they learn their lesson
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   from buzz.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.600]   We better really step back and think about this.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.040]   Is that your sense of what's going on here is, is this really fear holding people back
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   now?
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.360]   Well, if you look at, you know, Google when they launched buzz, this was, I think, we probably
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.560]   talked about this last time on the show when Google had launched buzz when I was here for
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.720]   the last time was, you know, Google had its own privacy issues with buzz.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.920]   That sort of, I don't, I wouldn't think it's fair to compare it to Began.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.760]   But you know, they wanted to make it very easy for people to share as much information
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   as possible.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.000]   So by default, they enabled, you know, your friends, your buddies, your contacts to actually
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.320]   show up on your profile.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.520]   And obviously that created a huge pre-oscitian for some people, but like that at all.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.480]   So it's reasonable for people to get into Google to be a little skittish, gun shy.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:11.800]   Well, you know, what I think this all goes to say is, it turns out that it's actually
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.040]   some friction is good, you know.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.280]   We can see both in the, in the privacy sense that you want to have these barriers that
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.840]   actually make people, you know, consciously give access to others.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.480]   But not only that, because this is another thing that we noticed when we did Jiku, I believe
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.040]   we were, you know, among the first, if not the first to actually aggregate what we were
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.160]   calling the live stream at the time, you know, when it was not just your status updates,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.840]   but we also pulled in feeds from the other services that you were using, which then became
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.360]   very popular with things like friend feed and, and now even Facebook's doing this.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.560]   And you know, when we look at the stats, the usage stats, we quickly realized that the
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.360]   updates that actually got the most engagement by far were the ones that people were still
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.320]   manually typing in, you know, the stuff you see on Twitter today.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.360]   Whereas the stuff that was pulled in automatically from other feeds wasn't really getting any
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.960]   engagement at all from, from people's audiences.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.400]   You guys, it must, it must call you a little bit that you were so far ahead of everybody
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.000]   else and still are actually, they still have an implemented.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.560]   Some of those things that you were doing in Jiku way back when it calls me.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.840]   And I don't even have anything to do with it.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.880]   So let's talk, there's quite a bit of a news stories.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.640]   And I guess as we started with the buzz topic, let's start with buzz.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.400]   Buzz has a fire hose and five new fire hose partners.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.240]   The fire hose is that thing we talked about a lot with Twitter, the idea that you can
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.200]   get every update, every bit of information.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.480]   By the way, with buzz is a lot of metadata.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.280]   There's a lot of extra information, things like comments, likes, shared counts, plus
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.760]   all the buzzes, and those will be given or sold.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.680]   I'm not sure which to collect a GANIP, Super Feeder, One Riot, and Post-Drank Analytics.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.320]   Now you have something to do with Super Feeder, right?
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   Yuri?
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   That's right.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   I'm an advisor.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.680]   So you must know then what the deal is.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   Is it a freebie?
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.960]   Is it, do you pay for it?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   How does this work?
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.720]   No, it's available.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.680]   I mean, the buzz fire hose is available for free basically to these companies.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.920]   You do have to make a deal with buzz though.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.960]   You can't just walk up and say, "plug into the fire hose."
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.640]   I believe you can just walk up and plug in.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.800]   Wow.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.240]   What does Super Feeder plan to do with it?
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.960]   Well, Super Feeder is trying to real-time enable all the feeds out there on the web.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.400]   And what it does is, obviously, the buzz feeds are actually already real-time enabled
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:43.280]   over this protocol called Pub/Sub Hub Hub that is basically a way of doing updates and push.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.320]   So anybody who used Pub/Sub Hub could subscribe to the fire hose?
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.720]   To the buzz firearms.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   That's correct.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   Okay.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.360]   And you can now do it with a single subscription before it was also possible, but you had to
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.000]   separately subscribe to all of the public feeds of each buzz user.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.760]   So now you can just basically do that with one single subscription.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.080]   So it's made very easy.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.840]   So anyway, with Super Feeder, it then does, for instance, with the buzz data is that it
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.040]   normalizes it, turns it into this format that's called "activity streams," which is
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.200]   like a standard for representing these activities across different services.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:25.120]   And then it just makes it very easy for subscribers to subscribe to the buzz fire hose, but also
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   all the other fire hoses or feeds, updates from other services that they aggregate.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.600]   And enable you to do stuff like, for instance, track, which is this, essentially define a
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.480]   set of keywords that will then trigger push updates to you so you can do things like,
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.760]   you know, I don't know, track your brand name or...
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   I see.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:51.240]   So I've signed up for Super Feeder and I get, I see these little snippets that I could
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.800]   then, these are API calls.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.600]   Is that right?
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:03.240]   So basically what you're doing is this is like a server to server, sort of like a B2B
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   service.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   Right.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:15.440]   So all you're doing is basically, if you're a publisher, you know, you can delegate your
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.720]   feeds to Super Feeder.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.880]   So for instance, if you already have RSS feeds but you don't want to build your own scalable
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.160]   way of pushing these feeds out in real time, then you can just basically say, "Well, I don't
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160]   want to build this myself.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.760]   I'd rather just delegate the Super Feeder."
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.280]   And so you basically let Super Feeder then start to do the pushing for you.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:42.100]   So I've subscribed for instance to our RSS from the Twit page and now it's going to be
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:48.040]   delegated to Super Feeder and then I can now use it in some way.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   Well, right.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.160]   So after this, you know, Super Feeder will automatically push you an update every time
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.600]   that the feed gets updated.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.200]   Using Pupsup Pub/ub or how does the push work?
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.640]   So I would also have an XMLP interface but I think Pupsup Pub is more popular there.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.120]   So I would have an endpoint of some kind.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.960]   We've talked about for instance a river endpoint.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.600]   This we would use this like crazy.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.200]   A river of data from a variety of sources.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.120]   So we would provide that endpoint.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.560]   Actually we'd use probably use a Jabber server as an endpoint, pushing that then out that
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.520]   people could subscribe to it.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.640]   And so you'd be aggregating all this stuff into it.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   We'd create an endpoint and then people could subscribe to our endpoint and we'd get it
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.360]   all from Super Feeder.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.520]   Yeah, that's possible.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.720]   Is that a common usage case or?
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   I think so.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.000]   You know, you really need to talk to Julian and Jealous Do who's the founder.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.880]   Is this actually, this is part of what I like about this.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.600]   So the way I discovered Super Feeder was I was still at Google and I was helping Brad's
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:55.960]   Pitspatrick and Brett Slatkin with a PEP project of theirs called Pupsup Pub/ub.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.240]   I'm not an engineer but I was sort of helping them a little bit with the product and messaging
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   all of it.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.440]   I don't know, basically I did some slides.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.880]   And so one day this French dude kind of just walks up and says, "Hey, I want to build
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.880]   a business around this.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:18.120]   I want to create a startup completely around this protocol and enabling everybody out there
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.160]   to basically create a hub of their own for free."
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.000]   And that sounded like a really fantastic thing to do.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.520]   So I got very excited about it.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.000]   Later when I left Google, Julian actually came back and said, "Hey, now that you're
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.280]   free, would you be willing to become an advisor?"
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.000]   And it's basically one guy and I think he has one part-time contractor somewhere like
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Germany.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.040]   And if you look at the amounts of data he pushes right now, I think he's pushing.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.520]   1.6 billion entries delivered so far.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.960]   And look at that counter turn.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.240]   And this is basically the same work that somebody like Twitter is doing.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.400]   So it's pretty incredible that he's pushing right now.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.920]   I think about 50% of the amount of data daily that Twitter pushes, which is about 25 million
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.560]   feeds, I think Twitter is around, or 25 million updates today.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   Somebody out there can correct me if I'm wrong here.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.280]   I think Twitter is around 51.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.160]   And it's just one guy, basically.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   So as an engineering feed, I really respect that.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.960]   I think it's going to start us up.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   Okay.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.280]   Part of the tooling that's going to be needed, the piping that's going to be needed for real
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.520]   time everywhere eventually, where just data is constantly flowing in two directions, really.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.160]   Yeah, I think the main point, the reason why this is relevant, I think, for anybody out
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.880]   there who's wondering what the heck is real-time about, is it's just a question of engagement
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   schools.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:49.600]   So if you take any updates and you watch the impact it has, if you can push it out immediately,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.640]   it's going to have a much higher probability of actually engaging your audience.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   Yes.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.760]   And if there is delay, and this is really what we're talking about here, is improving engagement.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.440]   It's exactly what we saw.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.080]   The reason we do this live now, we still allow, encourage people to download the majority,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.680]   people still download all of our shows.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.240]   But I feel in the long run engagement, it exactly goes up as people are participating
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.120]   in this show as it's being produced.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.120]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.320]   I think that if you have these various feeds in one place, it enables new kinds of analysis
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.200]   to help you prioritize the feeds.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.000]   And whatever that name of that iPad app is, link out to other things and display them
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.080]   in new ways that you're not trapped in one feed in one client.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   Right.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.960]   This is what we always wanted from Twitter.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.640]   All Twitter ever really gave us was search.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.640]   But really what we'd really like to do is analyze it and say, "I mean, I guess Twitter
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.880]   trends now is kind of going part of the way there."
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.000]   But it seems like there's so much data that the third parties should be able to have their
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.760]   way with it and come up with interesting use.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.920]   So Leo, what is the name of that new app?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.720]   Flipboard, is that what it's called, Gina?
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   Flipboard, yeah.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   Flipboard, yeah.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   It is actually the first app which may be wanted iPad.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.680]   Is this thing so wonderful or is it just a scoble moment?
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.560]   The jury's still out.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.320]   Feels like a scoble moment, doesn't it?
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   [laughter]
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.040]   You know, and as I said, I'm using it only as a one-legged user.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   It's beautiful.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.680]   I mean, it has that going for it.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.720]   But because I'm only using it, let me pull it up and I can show it to you, only using
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.280]   it as a Twitter thing.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:29.040]   Does it do analysis of the feed in or does it just go in and fetch the links?
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.000]   Good question.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.200]   It looks like it's just a really nice, brownie price.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.800]   It's just a pretty way to look at it.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   With images and links.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.840]   It looks like if someone tweets a link, now I'm saying this, I don't own an iPad and I
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   haven't actually tried it.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.560]   I just watched the video and kind of drooled a little bit.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   Watch this.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   This is cool.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.560]   See, there's no Facebook.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   We're going to stop, we need an all-in-all, you know, we're turning a page.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.560]   [laughter]
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.560]   It's just like paper, Jack.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.560]   Wow.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   It's just like paper.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.560]   It's just like paper.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   It's like paper.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.560]   It's like paper.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   It's like paper.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560]   It's like paper.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   It's like paper.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   It's like paper.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   It's like paper.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560]   It's like the old days.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   Remember that mod?
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   We used to have pages.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.560]   This is exactly the stuff Jeff hates.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.200]   The big influx of money and so forth that I can't sign into my Twitter account.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.680]   It's a new way to get a fail whale.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.600]   It is what it is right now.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   [laughter]
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   It's the big deal.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.600]   It's the big deal.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   It's the big deal.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   It's the big deal.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   A fail whale.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   [laughter]
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   Let me see if I can sign in now.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.000]   I've been trying all morning to sign into this darn thing and it's just not been...
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.200]   Today, if things be down, Google News was down, Facebook stories, their whole new thing
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   was down.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.520]   So there's bad karma today.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.000]   Can't connect to Twitter.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   It's broken.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.240]   I'm sure it's wonderful.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   It's pretty.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   [laughter]
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.800]   I mean, this really defines the iPad experience.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   It's pretty.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.120]   I think they said something online about adding new users and waves that they're being hammered
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   right now.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.440]   Yeah, obviously they're being hammered.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.640]   What that does show you is there is a huge amount of interest in these kinds of things.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.240]   We are interested in getting information in new ways.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.280]   We are interested in parsing that information.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.440]   I think this is actually how the conversation got started before we went on the air.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.920]   I've getting the feeling that there is some more engagement happening with buzz.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.120]   People are finally starting to get around to finding out about buzz and participating
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   in buzz.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.400]   You said a number that is unverified but would be astounding if true that there's what
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   10 million active users daily?
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   No, you didn't say that, did you?
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.080]   Oh, it's just a rumor I heard.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.720]   That would be stunning.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   What is Twitter?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.920]   Is it 100 million?
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   80 million?
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   Daily active?
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   85 million?
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.960]   I can't remember what the daily active is on Twitter.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.320]   It's 10 million would be truly mind boggling.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.480]   That must be the Gmail number.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.200]   Or maybe because of Gmail it has that kind of a...
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   Right.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.760]   Well, you would expect, you know, buzz to have a pretty high number just because of the fact
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.960]   that it's a better new Gmail.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   It's...
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   Have you noticed this, Gina?
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.200]   Well, I do know us because Gina is now in it.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.960]   She was just porting her tweets to it.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   Now she actually buzzes.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960]   Once in a while.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   Once in a while.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   So I know...
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.200]   I still need it to be in my Google Apps account.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   But uh...
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   You can't do that yet.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   Not yet, not yet.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   Well, I'm a...
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's been a long time coming.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.160]   Yeah, I'm a buzz fan.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   I still like it.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.440]   I like the engagement and the conversation that goes on in buzz.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.280]   And it is the first place I check now.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.240]   I do not check Twitter particularly often.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   Really?
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   Really?
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   I'm just a weirdo.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.120]   There's a value in having threaded conversations where you can follow a conversation.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.200]   That's connected, you know?
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   So, uh...
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.840]   Yeah, but it depends on the quality of the conversation.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.880]   I get some really dumb and dorky conversations going in buzz.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880]   That's fair.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.760]   And so people are sure are bad at me that I don't join in, but I kind of think I'll
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   go to another cocktail party.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   Thank you very much.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   That hasn't...
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.960]   That hasn't, you know, turned off Leo before.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   Yeah, I'm used to dumb and dorky.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.360]   I'm used to dumb dorky.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.600]   I'm used to dumb dorky.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   I'm used to dumb dorky.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.360]   In March, PC World says that according to RJ Metrix, Twitter showed number of Twitter
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.200]   users at 75 million.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   That sounds about right, yeah.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.000]   Is that one of the only deals monthly?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Is that one of the only deals monthly?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   No.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.240]   I think that's monthly.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   That's monthly is the number that Facebook uses.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.480]   Between 10 and 15 million active tweeters.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   A day.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   No.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.480]   I'm guessing.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.160]   Well, if you're active, you're going to tweet daily.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   I mean...
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160]   What's the...
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.440]   I think I think we have 500 million number for Facebook is that monthly.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   That's monthly.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:33.640]   By the way, that tonight, Diane Sawyer will interview Mark Zuckerberg and become the 500
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.120]   millionth Facebook user.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.120]   That's all friender.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:43.560]   Do you think it'll be an absolutely good Zuckerberg interview?
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.720]   Forgive me if I'm skeptical.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.400]   I've never heard of a good...
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   It's like interview.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   You know what?
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   He won't sweat.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.440]   I can almost guarantee you there will be no sweat involved.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.440]   No return to the moment.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   I face in Diane.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   I face.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   I'm holding out.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   Make him sweat.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   I don't know.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   I'll be...
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   I'm going to watch it.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   I wish I was proper walters that I cry.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.680]   Why are you Mark Zuckerberg like a twee?
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   What kind of twee would you be?
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.160]   I just let it know that I think that the Facebook bashing is getting to be predictable
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.160]   and boring.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.320]   That's why I stopped it.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   I did not.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   I...
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.320]   I...
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.080]   There were three stories this week that I blogged about positive Facebook news and every one
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.120]   more than the reporter has to find some way to take it to a slap and a snipe.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.600]   And here's a metric from our chat room.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   The TPS tweets per second and the average TPS is 750 but during the final of the World
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.360]   Cup 3000 TPS four times the normal rate.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.360]   That's crazy.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.800]   Superfeeder doesn't store the data.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   Right, Yuri?
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   It just...
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.040]   It just kind of a middle server for passing the pings back and forth for saying, "I'm
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.720]   going to receive the pings and I'm going to ping the subscribers."
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   That's right.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.680]   Yeah, I don't think they're currently storing the data.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.040]   That's what you're doing with Think Tank.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   Oh, with that, Jack.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040]   Do you have a new name, by the way?
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   Should I call it something else?
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   Not yet.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   No new name yet.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   Yeah, but you know, I'm not...
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.560]   I think Tank's purpose is definitely not to store the fire hose.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.680]   It's to store just the people you care about, your network's data.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.080]   Well, in fact, that's what one of the things that when people were begging for the fire
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.360]   hose last year from Twitter, that's one of the things they said is, "Oh, you can't handle
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   the truth.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   You can't handle the fire hose."
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.640]   Yeah, I wouldn't even want to try storing the fire hose.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   It's too big.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.280]   Just handling the pings at that rate is an incredible engineering feat.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.080]   But storing that data is like, no one can do that except Google.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.040]   You store mine, right?
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.080]   But I can store yours and I can store your friends and I can store your followers.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   Yes.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.560]   Right, so you can't do it because you're storing it.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   You can analyze stuff, right?
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.680]   Are you learning stuff about data?
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   Yes, exactly.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.960]   That's the kind of thing that we want to do, sentiment analysis and keyword frequency
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.400]   and keyword clustering and just trends amongst your social circle, that kind of thing.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   It's all about your network.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:08.360]   So you're more interested in the human relations or the content relationships?
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.160]   The content as it sort of comes out of the human relationships.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.720]   I think this is where the power lies, right?
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.960]   But that's for kind of a regular user.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   For a user like the White House or I don't know, the City of New York, it's about sort
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.680]   of connecting with citizens and coming up with policy ideas from that.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.360]   That's a little bit of a different relationship, right?
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.480]   But for me and my readers are Leo and his readers at U.J.F.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:35.080]   It's about friendships and relationships as more traditionally defined versus fans of
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   some big brand.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.600]   But I think there's use both ways.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.440]   It's a very interesting tension going on right now because we all want this.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.360]   We all would love this information.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.440]   There's such huge monetary value in this information and yet there's this huge fear over privacy.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.840]   And this is why I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg continues to say over and over again, "We
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.600]   know you want to connect.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.400]   We just want to help you connect."
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.200]   Well, Twitter, but we say that's the kind of knee jerk thing that happens here.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.600]   Twitter, you're publishing to the world.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.880]   Unless you've made it private, you're telling the world that anybody can follow you unless
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.840]   you block them.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.320]   And so what privacy?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   Right.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.680]   Facebook, I think is different because of, and we've discussed this in the show before,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.880]   the devotion that you're creating a closed society.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.280]   But as long as you can respect that and the issue that the people didn't really understand
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.120]   the defaults and fine, fine, fine.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   But yeah, I think he's got a point.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:34.600]   I've seen two studies recently, one I blogged about when I didn't, that showed people who
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.480]   were given the opportunity to have more privacy than less.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.280]   And even though they'd say, if you ask them a survey, "Oh yes, I care very deeply about
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.000]   privacy," they would not act that way.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.400]   In both cases, they were given discounts to reveal information and they said, "Fine."
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.520]   People yelled at me online that, "Well, they're all lied.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.760]   Well, maybe so."
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.480]   But if they were trying to protest against privacy policies, they didn't like.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   But that's the log, Jim.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.960]   That's the roadblock that keeps us from doing all these cool, neat, wonderful things with
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.880]   aggregated data from people.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.960]   So maybe should we just get over it?
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:17.880]   Well, I think it's kind of pointless to argue about whether public data or private data,
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.320]   which one is better.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:28.680]   The fact is that what we just need is for that to be a transparent consumer choice.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.920]   Then people will just make up their minds better.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.480]   And I think there's a lot of evidence towards saying that, well, generally individuals
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.800]   tend to get a lot of benefits by opening up and being more public about.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.280]   I think we all attest to that as users because I'm assuming we all have public streams.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.240]   And it helps us get ahead in life because it's just like before we started the show, Leo,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.560]   you were on your chat channel asking somebody a question or just posting a question out there,
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.360]   which you wouldn't be able to do if you had a very close group of people because they
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.440]   might not stay online at the moment.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.840]   Well, also, just for example, here, because my god, Leo was showing his ignorance.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.800]   He was revealing something of himself.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.760]   I do that a lot.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.240]   He was happy to do so because good things came in.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.680]   It does reward ignorance, doesn't it?
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.000]   Or at least a willingness to ask for help.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.520]   I've been reading this ridiculously thick book.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.840]   I'm show off, yeah.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.520]   The printing press has an agent of change.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.280]   And what was fascinating to me, and I'm logging together today, was that in the early days of
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.200]   books, they knew they were going to mess up.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.960]   The scribes had always messed up, moveable type they messed up.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:40.600]   And so they got in the habit of having a rata and it was an open door to collaboration.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.760]   The knowledge that you were going to mess up and make mistakes is what enabled people to correct
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.440]   and map makers.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.480]   This was a fascinating speech.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.600]   It's just like today on the internet.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:57.560]   One map publisher would reward people who would go off and correct his data and find new data.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.440]   And people would do projects and new kinds of things around it.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.600]   It was a very Wikipedia kind of thought.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   And we turned books into stone sculpture when they really, at the early days, were wet clay.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.920]   It's just fascinating by the stuff.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.400]   That's amazing.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.760]   And there's a cultural attitude that comes with privacy and this notion of control and
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.520]   perfection and all kinds of things.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.120]   You're not going to get these benefits if you don't open up, as Yuri says,
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.720]   and show your ignorance.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:35.000]   But I think the public interaction leads to really high quality private interactions too.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.680]   Jeff, didn't you say that a friend of yours asked you a question about surgery that maybe he or
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.880]   she couldn't have asked if they didn't know that you would come through it?
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.360]   I got a few of them recently.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.080]   Exactly.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.560]   We're but it only happened because, as you say, I was public.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.520]   Public, right, right.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.760]   Because I would say that some of my higher quality interactions happen on Twitter are
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:58.680]   from protected users or DMs that sort of get sparked from a public tweet.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.040]   So I think there's definitely value in having those private channels.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.400]   Private channels are very valuable.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.960]   But a lot of conversations can start with the public.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.400]   That's just what Yuri is saying too.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.560]   Is that the control is in your hands?
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.360]   You know what is what?
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.400]   This is an email.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.120]   The fact that they're asking an email means that I'm not going to reveal it.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   I've had one email conversation, one Facebook conversation.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   Yesterday, someone well known sat down next to me in a meeting in the morning and wrote
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.000]   on a pen a paper that this person had just had a biopsy.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.160]   The reason this person said it was because didn't you talk about your case?
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:31.720]   It was your blog.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.160]   Wow.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.120]   See, what's different is biologically we're tuned to do that in a select case, you know,
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.160]   in shared inimacies.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.120]   Well, this is something we've always had.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.080]   We have shared inimacies.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.360]   It's a way of building intimacy.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.960]   Doing it in public kind of shorts, it's a natural urge, but it shorts circuits
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.480]   that to and fro that parody.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.440]   So you're sharing intimacy globally with people.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.000]   I mean, you would never have done that in the past.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.240]   Well, except that I could have written an article.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.040]   I guess you could.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.800]   I mean, the means were there.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.080]   The means were the pre-impressed came along and the stage came along.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.840]   You were speaking to people who were strangers and you were making them less strange.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:15.320]   And I guess your point is you're the modern man who lives a person, I should say, who lives in public.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.440]   And what you're saying is look at the benefits I read from living in public.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.720]   And are you saying that they outweigh the negatives?
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.440]   I'm saying that every time we decide something, we should make the balance.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.080]   And that certainly it's your choice.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.520]   If people have prostate cancer and don't want to tell the world, I don't think I should out them.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.160]   There's no reason to, but that there is benefit to the individual, to the people they talk to,
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   and to the group to be revealing.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:48.040]   Crap, if I'm wrong here, but I think that if gays had stayed in the closet,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:53.080]   because they were cowed to do that, wouldn't have the rights we have today.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.960]   And that led to a logic that said you should out people.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.800]   And I think it is going a bit too far.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.520]   Nonetheless, to convince people that there is benefit in coming out and being out,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.760]   then leads to a greater benefit for the whole of the community.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:15.480]   And the publicness is the weapon you have against those who would try to make you stay secret.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.000]   And whenever something is revealed, it doesn't say so much about the person who reveals it.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.520]   If you're afraid of revealing, it's because people are bigoted around you.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.280]   That's why Stonewall is so important.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.960]   That's why Rosa Parks is so important.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.400]   It's a public act.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.000]   So to me, the challenge for Facebook, the interesting challenge for Facebook,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.920]   and I think Zuckerberg truly honestly believes this. I really take him at his word on this.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.800]   I think so too.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.240]   That he does think an open world is a better world, and I agree.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.040]   So the challenge becomes, how do you sell that?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   The same way Google has the challenge constantly of selling the idea that
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.240]   shared knowledge is going to benefit everybody.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:59.880]   What about the notorious cases of somebody being in public and becoming being attacked?
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.720]   Whether it's Kathy Sierra or this poor 10 year old girl whose YouTube video was
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.360]   4-channed and now she's getting dead threats.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.960]   There are edge cases and there are bozos.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.120]   So those are edge cases.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.640]   But if we had to manage all life based on what could happen,
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.040]   sorry, I'm going to go to my cave now.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.560]   No, you're right.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.360]   So here's another sort of, you know, now that we all agree that, you know,
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.600]   this is a personal choice that people should be allowed to make and that there's clear benefits
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.720]   for probably both sides here, but definitely it's sort of, you know,
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.600]   certainly for being public.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.920]   And Facebook's kind of, I think behind Twitter here in the sense that, you know,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   they started off with a private model and all of this commotion about Facebook's privacy issues
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.320]   has to do with the fact that they are trying to, you know, little by little,
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.560]   move the dial from private towards public.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.600]   Now we've got another player in the picture, which is Twitter.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:03.320]   And since I'm coming to this because we talked about the Google Buzz Firehouse.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.520]   And, you know, a major idea behind the entire web.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.160]   And if you go back to the starting base of Google, you know,
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:17.240]   and PageRank and search, fact is Google was made possible,
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   Google couldn't be possible if all that data hadn't been out there on web pages publicly
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:29.320]   crawl. And if you look at what's going on right now, we have millions of people on Twitter who are
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.360]   making the conscious choice of making their tweets public.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:41.800]   However, that data is then kept from becoming publicly crawlable.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.920]   Why probably it is in a nutshell, very well said.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.960]   Well said.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.280]   And that's from a, like, just, you know, I'm a sociologist by training.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.800]   So from a societal perspective, I think, you know, Twitter, I know,
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.520]   I have a tremendous respect for, you know, probably the entire management of Twitter,
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.640]   which just keeps getting improving with better people.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.600]   But at this point, I strongly disagree with them because I think it's almost, you know,
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.000]   if you claim, you know, what is their thing, be a force for good,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.720]   then it arguably is one of the key aspects of being a force for good to enable this data to be
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.800]   out there because then other people can build the types of super feeders and whatever,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:27.400]   you know, we've seen here that will actually, you know, deliver more value based on that data.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.320]   And that's impossible if we have to make these backroom deals to access the firehouse.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.840]   So question to both you, Yuri, and to Gina, what is the one thing you wish Twitter would do?
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.080]   Open up the firehouse.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   But we've been begging this of them for two years since Bear hug camp.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.600]   I vividly remember this conversation going on.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:54.840]   And Facebook's the same way, by the way, Facebook will, well, now they allow you to keep that data
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.280]   longer, but they really don't open that data. Of course, their problem is they have a compact
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.840]   with their users kind of not to open up that data.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.480]   Yeah. Now, they really kind of can't, especially now.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.520]   Yeah. That's the difference.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.240]   But, Gina, is it just a question of getting the firehouse?
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.960]   As you said, the expense of taking it is extreme.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.760]   Is there also an API to the store database that you might need to pay for,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.840]   but that would be more valuable to enable you to do more valuable things?
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.320]   Oh, I mean, definitely. Yeah. For me, it's less about the firehosen, more about, like,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.280]   if I've posted more than 3300 tweets, I should be able to get all of them.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.880]   And right now you can't. And it's kind of an artificial limit because it's a performance thing,
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.360]   and they keep promising, hey, we're going to make this available eventually.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.240]   But right now, I couldn't just go to the API and get all of my tweets in 2007,
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.800]   because I posted more than 3000. And there are a few limits like that.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.280]   You can't go back to all the tweets that have a particular keyword in them.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.640]   It only goes back a few days. And a lot of people say, hey, it's a theme role.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.360]   That's the whole thing. But that bugs me that that data is just sort of gone.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   Especially my data, the stuff that I've posted.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.640]   Clearly, Twitter doesn't believe that, or they wouldn't have given their data to the Library of
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.480]   Congress. They know it's not a femmer. Other than that.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.200]   Exactly. Well, and the changes and the analysis matter.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.000]   That story I've talked about here before, that Twitter is 97.13% accurate,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.560]   in particular, in the success of movies at the box office.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.680]   There's data there that you want to compare and say, how much more are people talking about this
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.520]   or that? There's news value there. Definitely.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.080]   And if you go to the very page says that data saves lives, that by keeping data out there about
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:33.960]   flu and health, we're going to save lives by knowing where the gigantic epidemic is going to come
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.160]   from. We'll save lives. Well, I think at some point that's true of Twitter too.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.960]   Twitter saves lives. Absolutely.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.640]   Analyze and say it didn't hate it didn't hate it.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.160]   Absolutely. People were tweeting. I'm stuck in a building. Save me.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.040]   Or if it's the any bandages that says, my God, look at the increase of the word fever in this
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.240]   part of the world. There you go. But it's not anything as Twitter is just a little thumbnail of what
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.160]   all is possible here. And that's the key. And that's what's so interesting about having these
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:06.360]   emerging standards like Pub/Sub, Hub, Bub, and a salmon and all of this stuff. And the ability to
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.560]   stitch something together out of all of these emerging standards and for developers to have
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:17.400]   access to this data so that we can see innovation and see interesting things happen as a result.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.840]   And that's the reason I'm frustrated. We all about this is that we've spent a lot of time working
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.880]   out these standards and that's not really work. And there's a whole community of people out there,
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.360]   people with leaders like Chris Messina, David Corinan over at Facebook,
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:40.200]   great people at Twitter as well. The issue is none of this work, none of the standards work has any
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:46.600]   value at all if we don't have access to the data. So that's enough. It's very frustrating to
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:54.280]   sort of be working on this stuff and then just kind of having people kind of not see that value.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.400]   Because in the end what we want out of the internet as a whole and specifically the web,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:07.320]   the social web is for you to continue to be this right pool of crazy life forms emerging.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:12.600]   And that's just not possible unless you have that data out there and those standards on which
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.160]   people can build. So we can do stuff like we were already talking about production, market
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.560]   prediction games. Think about all the kinds of apps that you could build if you had access to
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:28.680]   all this firehouse data through places like Super Feeder instantaneously for just playing around
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.640]   with ways to predict anything from the stock market to these epidemics we're talking about.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:41.000]   That's like a huge potential there. We have stuff like analytics for impact analysis,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.640]   how efficient are your tweets, how do you optimize your publishing. All that requires a
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:53.160]   lot of number crunching based on the statistics of all the aggregate data out there. So you can't
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.800]   build any of this stuff unless you have access to this data. So what makes me very frustrated is
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.640]   that I see a huge tremendous business opportunity that we're just beginning to scratch. I mean,
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.880]   it's not just business opportunity, it's actual value for society at large. And we really need
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.800]   access to this data in order to realize that potential value. I think we're going to get there.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:17.240]   It's our data. Well, you were pumping the data in and then there's this blockage. I think
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.040]   the world's the wisdom of the crowd. In Twitter's case, the blockage is a technical one. I don't
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.880]   think they're perhaps they're trying to figure out how to monetize. But I think there's also
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.680]   technicals issues involved as well. I mean, let's give them the benefit of the data.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.040]   Let's think to another question. There's another question here that I have for you guys.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.480]   Then there's some discussion, always has been discussion that Google should release
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:48.680]   the scrape database. A lot of people do that the crawling is a waste that's a standard.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   That's one level of discussion. Then the New York Times was talking about how, and I think this was
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:58.280]   so John Henry or another, but they were talking about how the Google's too powerful,
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.160]   says the argument, you know, show me the line where it says what's powerful enough.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.960]   And thus the government should regulate its algorithm. Yeah. Oh boy. That was a crazy article.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.360]   Yeah, it was insane. But is there, but it's what you were saying, there's some level where we're
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.160]   saying that there's an ethic of releasing things and making them open because it's our stuff or
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.440]   because there's greater value out of it, because it's the smart thing to do.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:25.400]   Where's that line? If Google does the scraping, but it's scraping the web,
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.680]   this our kind of web, should they be revealing that so that others can build on it? Would that
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:34.920]   be smart for them to do? I would say, I would say, here's my thought that the raw data belongs to
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:42.280]   all of us. That is that that is the public resource, but that just as you should be able to patent
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:47.400]   an innovation, I think people should be able to innovate and feel like they can generate value
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:54.360]   out of that innovation by protecting it. So add value in your algorithm. So if Gina wanted to say,
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.240]   I'm not going to tell anybody how think tech works, but the raw data is available and the results
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.120]   you might want to sell, I think that's fine. I think that that's that's how innovation happens.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.080]   People are much more likely to do it if they can benefit from it, don't you think?
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.680]   There's a patent system though, some sort of expiring kind of protection.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.200]   Maybe this stuff should be--
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.680]   Well, just got a patent. This is a fascinating reverse here. Google got a patent that's on the
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:26.840]   friend feed for revealing topics in which there's inadequate content, not enough content,
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.480]   which of course is the demand media model where they go looking for that to see the opportunity
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.960]   for creating SEO valuable content. Sounds like a defensive patent, maybe.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.200]   Exactly. So the speculation is that Google will open that up to the world, which just kills
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.920]   demand media and says, "Hey, whole world, fill in these blanks in the web."
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:51.800]   That's kind of fascinating to me where it's a turnaround of saying that by having this
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:57.080]   analysis and opening it up, which is only speculation. By the way, Matt cuts and Halverian are two of
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:02.120]   the members of the patent team. Interesting. Well, they're the any spam guys, right?
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.520]   Yeah. So what does the acquisition of MetaWeb say to all of this? Actually, let's take a break
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.760]   and come back. We're going to talk about MetaWeb, the redesign of Google News and the big, big
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.160]   announcement, the redesign of Google Images. And of course, we've got your picks, your numbers.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.480]   I've got a tip. We've got some Android news as well. It's all with lots of stuff to talk about.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:25.000]   And we have about another 25 minutes to half an hour to talk about it. Yuri Angostram is here.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   He is a former Googler, founder of Jaiku. And now a man about town. His blog is zenghastram.com,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.400]   jina turobani from smarterware.org, buzz machine.com's Jeff Turobani. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.240]   You're going to tell you something we owe you. Oh boy. Jeff Jarvis is here. More coming up in
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   just a bit. We do want to thank our friends at Citrix who are sponsoring the show today.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.440]   Citrix creates a great array of remote access products, some of the best out there. Of course,

[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:38.040]   You could view another person's computer online and control it so you can resolve the
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.320]   technical issues quickly. It's remote access put to its best use, if you ask me, fixing other people's
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.560]   problems. You can use go to assist right now by going to go to assist.com/twig free for 30 days.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.840]   Your clients do not have to have it installed ahead of time. You just send them a link.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.520]   They follow that link to go to assist.com. Install the software 30 seconds later. You're in and fixing
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.680]   the problem. From then on, if you wish, you can have unattended access to that machine. You can
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.320]   have up to eight sessions at once. So it's great if you're starting a scan or an install. You can
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.240]   move to the next machine, the next, and next. You can even drag and drop fixes and installs and
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:16.440]   files from your computer to theirs, which is really great if you're on malware bites or
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.920]   something, you want to drag it over and scan their machine. It also allows you to do an
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.520]   assay of what operating system is running, what software is running in the background,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.960]   including security software. Mac or PC, so you don't have to have a PC to fix a Mac or a
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.040]   Mac to fix a PC. It really couldn't be better. I just love what they've done with this program

[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:57.320]   and friends, go to assist.com/twig. We thank Citrix for their support. I've got to assist. So
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.520]   given what we've just talked about and all these subjects, MetaWeb makes a lot of sense. What is
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   this is a semantic search startup? What does this add to Google's portfolio? Is it just a hire for
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:14.440]   the engineers or is this free base, this open shared database of the world's knowledge that MetaWeb
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:20.120]   does? Is this part of what we're talking about here? Are you familiar with MetaWeb? Do you know what it
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:28.840]   does? Anybody? Uh oh, you lost sound. Yuri, I don't hear you. Did I turn you off? No, you're
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:37.880]   still there. Are you there? There he is. Okay, good. Right. Yeah. MetaWeb obviously is assigning
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:44.840]   machine readable meaning to the web and operates free base. But I don't have intimate knowledge of
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:50.200]   the details of that acquisition. Right. Right. It could be that Danny Hills was the point, the guy
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:57.320]   who started it. It could be that the free base is the point. And it seems like a general overall
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   trend of interest towards structured data for Google, right? On top of the travel data database.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:08.680]   I mean, there've been a few stories like this. It's pretty clear that Google realizes a mere
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:15.960]   index of web pages is not a good business going forward. You need to do more with the data that
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.680]   you're getting. You need to have more data. You need to be able to look into the dark web. You need
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.880]   to get things like travel information. You need to be able to put that information together for
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:31.640]   your customers to provide a better experience. That's what being kind of forced Google into, I think.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.800]   That's kind of the idea behind being. Right. I think we're seeing, you know,
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:44.520]   I haven't heard many people talk about Wolfram alpha recently, but you know, there's something here
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.720]   that, you know, would suggest that Google sort of thinking about ways to sort of maybe perhaps
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.440]   venture into this same space and, you know, do it their own way only to sleep. I guess MetaWeb is
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:00.120]   like Wolfram alpha, isn't it? In that sense, it's understanding the data. Yeah. What have happened
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:06.520]   to Google base? I'm looking forward right now. Yeah, Google base. Remember that? What was that?
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:13.800]   Yeah, it was a structured database. So, you know, a way that you could do real estate listings and
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:19.640]   job listings. I just went to base.google.com and I says, Google base data, I'm getting a sign into
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:25.800]   merchant center. But this, you know, this seems like something similar to Google base, which I
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.120]   haven't heard a whole lot about. I remember writing it up on life hacker quite quite a lot.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.760]   I think different Google base was that you could submit data that was then searchable in a new way
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.320]   by Google. Is that like all? That's right. That's right. Yeah, that's what the difference is.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.640]   Okay. Yes, you're right. You're right. So it's knowledge. It was knowledge. Well,
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:49.240]   knowledge was more like a wiki, right? But base was more like a spreadsheet or database of data,
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.000]   but you created it and you entered the data. So if you're an economist that had a huge,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.480]   big data set, you could put it in there. Yeah, people would be able to chew on it.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.280]   Yeah, it classified ads seem to be the big thing that it could do kind of like Craigslist.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.880]   Yeah. That's why the merchant login. That's why it's now going to merge login.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.600]   Yeah, I guess I'm looking at the Wikipedia article. It says October 2009 was announced that Google
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   base's separate search page would be discontinued. Well, one page not deemed discontinued. One
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   page that's growing Google image search 10 billion images served a day, one billion page views.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.720]   Clearly, Google sees this as a very valuable product. In fact, they had an event, a search
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:37.240]   event in San Francisco this week. Marissa Meyer announced a revamp of Google images. It looks
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:42.520]   just like Bing. It does. It looks very much like Bing's. Google's getting bingish.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:47.640]   But I'm going to talk about what you can do with it in my tip. Oh, good. Well, we won't, we won't give
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.760]   that away. You can even give me that. Well, that pretty stuff. Okay.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.680]   Okay. So do you not want me to talk anymore about this? But save it.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:52:00.440]   Well, yeah, we can do it. We can do it now if you want. No, no, no, save your tip. We'll talk about
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:05.720]   Google image. We're so sensitive about our little terms. Oh, don't miss the tips, Leo.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:12.840]   Don't mess with the tips, baby. Google energy bought its first property. Wind power.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:19.160]   I love it that I have to think it's Larry and Sergey who are the activists here that they
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:25.560]   really want to promote their agenda. And in this case, and it makes sense because Google's a huge
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:33.640]   consumer of energy. Google energy agreed to purchase 114 megawatts of wind power per year
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:42.200]   for the next 20 years. So they locked it in with the Iowa wind farm called Next Era Energy Resources.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:47.480]   I saw a tweet and I didn't see a source for it from our friend, Siva, and I believe said that
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:54.280]   10% of the energy in the US is now used for electricity in the US is now used for computers.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:00.040]   Holy cow. Yeah. I don't know if that's true or not. I'm sure Siva wouldn't buy just to have a link.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:05.480]   But it says that gives you an idea of the of the this is the light and self interest for Google.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:11.000]   Right. If they can get good clean power cheaper than coal,
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.600]   it's better for nobody in the economy practically than them.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:20.520]   They have they invested $38 million before there was a Google energy in the next era
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:26.600]   energies, wind generation projects in North Dakota. They also have bought startups like
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:35.480]   Altra Rock Energy, E-Solar, and AlertMe. So some of this is philanthropic and some of it is self-interest
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:44.920]   and it's nice if you can combine both. Exactly. Yeah. The purchase of these wind megawatts
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:50.360]   actually is just blocking in their business costs. Pretty interesting. Right. I mean,
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.680]   actually what they're purchasing is the RSCs, right? Right. They're not actually planning to
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.640]   directly use that energy. Oh, they just get the credit. Yeah, they're just buying the credits so
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.240]   that they can, you know, pollute, proceed on the way to, yeah, exactly become more carbon neutral.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.640]   That's good. So they're really what they bought as carbon credits.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:15.560]   You had an article on Buzz Machine. Google takes the FTC to school, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.040]   It was kind of beautiful because Google, I've been arguing, has been trying to make friends of
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:25.320]   people who only want enemies, that is to say newspapers. Right. And they've been, you know,
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.080]   working with kid gloves and working together and saying that since they finally, the FTC,
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.320]   and I've talked about this on the show, came up with these ridiculous
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.160]   suggestions from people who testified for how to fix the news industry, which is that to say how
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:43.720]   to rescue newspapers. And Google finally, I think, must have had it and wrote this wonderful
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:50.040]   document to some primer taking the FTC and the newspaper industry to school and just not taking
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:57.640]   their bull anymore, not accepting the myths that searches bad. It kind of explained the industry
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:02.360]   to them. There was this wonderful first paragraph that just said, or that I put on top of my post,
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.120]   that just explained to them that we're in an abundance economy now, not a scarcity economy,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.720]   more things have changed. It's never going to be the same deal with it. And it was a very good
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.800]   document. I put the highlights on Buzz Machine. Yeah, it's about a 25 page document. It says long
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.080]   document, but it's really very well done. The current challenges,
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   please. Yeah, it's a really, really good post. The challenges faced by the news industry are not
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:30.120]   legal problems, they're business problems. And they can only be addressed with business solutions,
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:38.440]   not regulation, things like that. Yeah. So this is in response to a discussion draft from the FTC
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:46.200]   that would have what purpose? Well, the FTC is out there contemplating what to do and the FTC
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:51.960]   could come along and do some very dangerous things. Really? Google's real goal is to not get them to
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:58.600]   support things like extending copyright in ways that would support news organizations,
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:03.800]   to go for this hot news doctrine that would say that someone could own facts and news for some
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:11.000]   period of time, not to limit fair use, not to enable newspapers to operate in antitrust and do
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.080]   price fixing or gang up on Google and other aggregators to charge them with the support of
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:21.560]   government. These are the things that the FTC is talking about in there. And though they're saying,
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.160]   oh, it's just discussion. We're not endorsing anything, but it's what they chose to discuss.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:32.120]   And Google finally sees danger there and came out with a very strong, sensible, smart, well-researched
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.200]   statement. And part of this is just the history. It's like we're done with books before. We've been
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.960]   here before. News people thought the radio was going to ruin the world and TV was going to ruin
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.680]   the world, not the internet's going to ruin the world. Well, it's the world. Interesting. The Guardian
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:52.680]   calculates that the Times Online, which put up its paywall recently, has lost 90% of its readership.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:57:00.840]   The number of people, that's a one quarter of people landing on the Times registration page
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:07.880]   sign up, but that the website is now receiving just 4% of the UK's online newspaper visitations.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:14.040]   So clearly the paywall is not a solution that Rupert Murdoch hoped it would be.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.040]   Well, they all said that they don't know yet, and they were still... Or they don't care. Maybe they're
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.960]   happy with 10%. They would get the 10%, but it clearly is not a strategy for all and for the future.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:32.840]   And I still think it's a surrender by Murdoch. He didn't have any new ideas for advertising,
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.720]   he didn't have any new ideas for growth. And so he's retreating, which is odd for a guy who's
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:45.960]   using it normally so macho. So I think that the Guardian was looking at this further.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.160]   Now the Times, people will say back to the Guardian while the Guardian is losing a fortune.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.160]   They haven't figured it out either, which is true.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:58.680]   So more revisions in the Google News site, not in response to this, but in fact, in response to
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:04.840]   user and reader complaints, they're kind of cleaning it up a little bit. I still... I may be one of
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.920]   the few that actually uses news.google.com all the time. I actually like it.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:14.600]   I do too. Oh, okay, good. I use it occasionally. I thought it was just me. Okay.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.200]   Is it like your home page or... No, but it's a place I go for my beat check.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:26.120]   So in fact, there's two places I go for my beat check pretty much regularly. One is TechMem
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.960]   to see what people are talking about. And TechMem still is pretty valuable, pretty good.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.760]   And then... So that gives me the human... It wasn't human-powered for a long time, but it is now human-powered.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:42.440]   But human-powered in the sense that it's kind of saying, "Here's what people are talking about,"
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:50.600]   versus the kind of purely mechanical results that I get from news.google.com. But I do like to
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.880]   check it because it does tell me at least what the stories are. I guess the difference is it's
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.160]   not so much how many... Google News seems to be how many stories there are. And
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:05.320]   these are the most written about stories. And TechMem seems to be these are the most talked about
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.320]   stories. Things people are really caring about. So I think that's a good combination of the two
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.680]   of them together. Somebody RSS feeds to you tend to go through it. I still do go to Reader.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:22.360]   I have a Google section. So before I do the show, I will go to reader.google.com and look at the
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:27.240]   Google section, which is all the Google blogs. All like thousands of them or whatever it is.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:33.320]   There's some unknown huge number of them. And then a few sites like
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:39.800]   FanDroid and stuff that cover Google products. It's getting bigger all the time now.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:46.360]   I had kind of a fun experience this week. I did a post about Google Voice. I've been covering this
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.680]   Google Apps accounts catching up to regular Google accounts for a while.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.440]   Yes, yes. We should talk about that.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:57.880]   And so I had a reader. So I kind of worried aloud about, I said, well, I don't mind exporting all
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.160]   my data from one account and importing it to another. But Google Voice is one of those things
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.080]   that I was worried, how am I going to get my number from my old Google account to my Google Apps
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.920]   account? And so a reader of mine said, hey, there's this form that Google set up and you could just
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.400]   issue a request. And so I tried it and it worked. They transferred my number. So I did a post about
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.440]   it. And then Life Hacker picked it up. And then I got a voicemail from the Google Voice product
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:24.360]   manager. And you know, I don't give out my number very much. I'm kind of protective of my phone
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:30.120]   number. And my first thought was, how do you get my number? And then I thought, oh, he's Google.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:37.880]   He knows all manager. Yeah. So anyway, long story short, the form is not, it doesn't work for everyone.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.360]   And they've just been doing it for a small subset of accounts. But there will be a way to
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.000]   port your Google Voice number over to your apps account. Once the app stuff that they're testing
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.360]   does go live. And they're also testing multiple sign in from so like you're in one browser window
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.080]   and you say, hey, I've got these two Google Google accounts, you can assign them at the same time
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.880]   and switch them using a dropdown. I think that's also when our friend feed this week. Good. Good,
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.240]   good, good. You know, I've, I've gone back and forth on the iPhone four and I finally just gave up
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:14.280]   and I've, I bought the Droid X. And I am really liking this. I really am. It's a nice big screen.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   I really, I think I'm now converted. The Evo started the process. But once you get used to having a
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:26.040]   4.3 inch screen, it's kind of hard to go back to the smaller screens. And I just kind of get
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.160]   all your apps there. Like, that's the key thing for me. It's like, you know, this, I find it hard to
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.840]   not get some of the apps that I rely on. So I'm curious. Well, it depends what your apps are,
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:44.920]   obviously. But I get the apps that I, that I want, I guess, Mint recall, which I use as my to-do list
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:52.680]   is on, is on Google. Seismic, I use four square bump, Evernote, Audible has a great app,
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:02:01.000]   which I use all the time, LastPass, Pogo plug and drop box, Yelp, Zagit, Tripit. You know, I,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.760]   I would say major league baseball, it's interesting. There's a really large selection of apps on
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:14.520]   here now, Pandora, Skype. This unfortunately comes with a lot of Motorola baggage on it,
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.920]   which is true. That's what, Gizmodo did a pretty good review and said that the kind of default
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.480]   apps were really that the home screens were super cluttered and you had to clear away
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.200]   all this other stuff. And there's also an issue. I'll talk about that in just a little bit. I'll
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:32.760]   tell you how you can fix that. Okay. Okay. And the E-fuse, that's an interesting issue. And it
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.520]   hasn't been confirmed. Initially, they said it bricks the phone if you try to root it.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.400]   And now, you know, I was going to do it on the show, but nobody's got a root for it yet. So I have
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.920]   to wait. But once the cyanogen rom comes out or a root comes out for the Droid X, I will be glad to
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:53.160]   do this on my Droid X just to see what happens. What Motorola says is, first of all, it's not E-fuse.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.760]   That's a trademark name that I think IBM came up with. It's nothing like that. They said to protect,
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:05.080]   actually, I think this is legitimate, to protect the user if the baseband of firmware has been
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:11.240]   modified or some of the key firmware is modified. It boots into recovery mode. And from there, you can
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   boot back, you know, get a standard firmware and boot back to it. It does not brick it.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:22.920]   It just forces it into recovery mode. You know, I, of course, I want it to be an open phone. And I
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.400]   think if people want an open phone, they should get a Nexus one before they run out, because Google
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.280]   has stopped making, stopped selling them. No, they sell them.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.160]   Carriers will have them. Krista Bonas said. Really? Yeah. I love the Nexus one. I think the
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.600]   incredible is pretty close. But the thing about the Nexus one is it's pure. It's pure Google experience.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.560]   There's no crap from a carrier on it. It's pure. And it's the only phone running 2-2.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.520]   Yeah, although, not Eris, this is supposed to get 2-2 August 15th, Droid X.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.840]   Oh, that's soon. Yeah, that's what they told me at AT&T. I'm counting on that.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.880]   So yeah, I mean, Verizon, sorry about that.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.080]   That's one of the main selling points, by the way. It's not AT&T.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:11.320]   Now, I'm very happy with it. I like the big screen. What about the rumors that LTE is going to be out
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:16.040]   this fall? Well, then I'll have to get another phone, won't I? There's also rumors flying now that
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:22.760]   Verizon is about to do tiered data as AT&T does. And I imagine everybody's been watching carefully
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.160]   with AT&T to see if there are howls of pain. And since there haven't been any, everybody would
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.080]   like to do tiering on their data plans. So I think that's what you're going to see on every phone
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.440]   company. One phone company or two, maybe, that also runs, maybe Sprint and T-Mobile will probably
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.840]   be holdouts on this, right? And say, "No, no. We'll still give you all you can eat." But I have a
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:46.120]   feeling that Verizon and AT&T, for sure, maybe Sprint as well, will do tiering sooner than later.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:51.880]   Kindles on this. And of course, all the great Google apps that I love, Shoper and Goggles and
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:57.640]   gesture search and all of that. I'm really a fan of Android. I went back to the iPhone 4 just
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.960]   briefly just to see the antenna issue really did hurt me. I was getting a lot of drop calls.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.840]   And I missed, I really missed Android in the power of Android.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:11.080]   I got permission to get one for my birthday. Happy birthday. He's got an iPhone 4, everybody.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:18.280]   I got it. And I think I kind of have to have it. My wife looked at me
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.600]   obviously when I said that. No, I think you do. I have one. I'm not going to give it back.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.360]   I'm not going to do it for school and everything, the video particularly. But yeah, the thrill was
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:32.280]   gone. It was just said, "Okay, so it's..." Just another phone now. Yeah. They haven't really
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.480]   advanced the art in significant ways. No, and in fact, I think at least in a couple of areas,
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.400]   notifications is one. Screen widgets is another. They feel a little antiquated. I wish I could
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.200]   customize the screen war on the iPhone. It's a beautiful screen, but it's just a stack of icons
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:54.440]   or now folders. And I feel like actually Apple is very much in the situation.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:03.080]   They were in 1994 or maybe even earlier, early 90s when they had a huge lead because of Mac OS.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:08.840]   And Microsoft was chugging along, chugging along, finally came out with Windows 3.0,
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:14.440]   then Windows 3.1, then Windows 95 and effectively achieved parity. And I think what you're seeing
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:21.160]   here is the analogy I make, I really feel like the iPhone is very much like OS 7 was, system 7 was.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.640]   And the Android is very much like Windows was. It's catching up and it's iterating much more
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:31.160]   quickly than Apple. Apple can only iterate yearly. Android's iterating monthly practically.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.760]   New handsets all the time. Interesting new hardware. You've got a variety of hardware,
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:43.720]   which is part of the power of the PC platform. You could put Windows on a variety of different
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.760]   hardware and that diversity really helped the PC world. Apple was only on Apple stuff.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.680]   And I think that that's a very close analogy. I also feel like there's a little roughness,
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:00.760]   rough edgedness to Android that some Mac people say, "Oh, I miss the elegance of Apple." And I
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:06.200]   think that's very much like system 7 versus Windows 95. But I think it's very clear that
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:11.640]   Android's catching up. And in fact, if you look at installed base, Android is gaining rapidly
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.920]   on even the iPhone 4 as well as that sold. Far more Android handsets are being sold right now.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.400]   >> I want to say it. >> I want to say it.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.680]   >> I want to say a word. I want to say a word.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.360]   >> So I didn't think this would happen. I thought I was going to go back to the iPhone 4.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.520]   And it was the reception issues that finally did it for me. And yeah, there's two applications
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:36.200]   I miss. We rule and words with friends. They're better games, I'm sorry to say,
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.480]   much better games on the iPhone. >> Did you get the offer?
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:44.040]   >> Has anyone made an app that allows you to just like port, like copy all your apps,
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.240]   basically one for one from the iPhone to the Android at vice versa? If you wanted to switch.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.960]   >> Wouldn't that be cool? An iPhone emulator? >> That's what happened.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.920]   >> Just, you know, if I switch phones, you know, I could just, you know, copy my experience.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.640]   >> Oh, I see what you're saying. Well, that's, to me, that's a real strength of Android is that
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.480]   you can move from phone to phone and take your apps with you with AppBrain or
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:11.240]   Froyo lets you. I think Froyo lets you do that. What is it? What is it? Is it a Froyo thing,
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:16.120]   Gina? I can't remember. I didn't. I had to reinstall all my apps, but I just went to AppBrain,
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:20.280]   and I said, I have a new phone, and I was able to very quickly get all the apps moved over that I
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.280]   had. >> Yeah, just say install all.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:28.360]   >> Right. >> I think that AppData gets, I'm not sure. I'm not sure if apps go.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   >> There is some good Motorola stuff on here. There's a backup program that backs up all of your
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:38.120]   apps and files onto the SD card. I think that's kind of nice. There's a blockbuster app. Who
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.520]   cares? Need for SpeedShift? I have to say, it isn't that you can't write a good game on Android,
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:49.480]   because this game is amazing on Android. So I, you know, we were having a little debate on
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:56.280]   Mac Break Weekly over that, and I don't know how hard it is to develop for Android, but I have to
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.240]   say it's clear that you can make a very good game. Need for SpeedShift on the
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:08.280]   Android X is really pretty spectacular and plenty fast. So all in all, I'm very happy. Battery life
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.600]   is the only, the only sticking point as always. And I think the iPhone 4 really did, is Jeff,
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.640]   is your experience with battery life been pretty good on the iPhone 4? It has been on mine.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.560]   I'm sad to say. >> I haven't used it enough.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.680]   >> Yeah, it's, it's, I wish I had this, that kind of battery life on this thing. It barely gets to
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:32.360]   the day. But, >> It was the Droid.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:32.760]   >> Yeah, the Droid X is, it's, the problem, you know, really with all of these is you use them so
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.280]   much. The screen is always on, you're always playing around with it. So I don't know if it's a
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.080]   good test really, maybe as I get used to it. Anyway, that, a little thumbnail.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:46.040]   >> My, my master plan is to have the iPhone and then get the Droid X that way I get them Verizon,
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.560]   and I still have a GSM phone. >> That's my master plan. That's exactly what I did.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.040]   >> Will you carry the iPhone still? >> No, that's for international travel.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.720]   >> Did you get a bumper? >> Yeah, I had to get a case, and it still didn't help.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.560]   >> Did, still didn't help? >> Well, I'm, you know, I'm not, in New York,
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.720]   you probably don't have this problem, but I'm not in a good area for a AT&T. It just drops calls
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.840]   like crazy. >> I'm not wearing this.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.520]   >> That was what finally did it for me. It was, I dropped my like fifth call in two days and I was
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:18.440]   like, I can't, I cannot do this. I'm dying here. >> It is a phone.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.520]   It's a phone first. >> Yeah.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.400]   >> You know, it's, if it's not, if it's not a phone, what is it?
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   All right, I'm just gonna play the new need for speed. You guys continue on with the show,
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.320]   will you? >> I, I want to say this.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:35.640]   >> It is, it is an awesome, awesome game, I have to say. It's a lot of fun.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.000]   >> Oh, I'm already afraid for my, for my productivity.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.680]   >> Well, you know, are you gonna get a Droid X as opposed to, I mean, I, I still, you know,
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.040]   I, every time I pick up the Nexus one, I go, boy, this still is a great phone.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.200]   >> So does this not run? Oh, this doesn't run. You can't install this on the Nexus one.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.320]   Is that the, I don't know. >> I don't know. This just came on the Motorola.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.640]   >> I just came on it. Interesting. >> Yeah, I haven't tried it.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.680]   >> It's, I think it's, it's really good. >> Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.880]   And the big screen really makes it a lot of fun and it's got an accelerometer. So it's just like,
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.360]   this, yeah, that looks really fun. >> Just like the iPhone.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.600]   I think the, the graphics clearly keep up. Oh, I just shattered the windshield.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:18.440]   Oh, no, ah, I'm not a very, I'm not a good driver. It's really fun.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.720]   >> I'm gonna be heartbroken if this isn't in the market. My phone's in the other room.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.960]   >> I'll go check for you. You like driving games?
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.000]   >> I do.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.600]   >> Look at that. Look at that. I did with that windshield.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.160]   >> Nice.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.880]   >> It's, it's spider-ed. >> It's not, it doesn't look stuttery at all.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.120]   >> No, no, the framerate is quite good. I mean, I, I don't know if you can see how the resolution
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.200]   is not, you know, it's not super, super, super, super good. But let me see if I can,
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.320]   here, where's the camera? There it is. I'll get it a little bit closer.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.560]   There.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.000]   >> Oh, it's so nice.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.040]   >> It's definitely playable.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:52.840]   >> Oh, it's nice.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.280]   >> Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.800]   >> Yeah, that looks really fun. I'm mesmerized.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.480]   >> Okay.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.960]   >> I just brought the show to a halt, grind it to a halt. Let's, let's check on App Brain,
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.520]   whether it's available on, on other platforms.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.200]   >> But I guess the point is, and somebody,
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.240]   somebody, John Gruber was on the Mac break weekly yesterday, and he said,
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.560]   developer friend, a well-known developer friend of his said,
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.560]   he has very hard to develop for Android because of bugs in the OpenGL implementation
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.440]   that are different on each platform. And that makes a lot of sense.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:22.920]   So maybe-
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.160]   >> This, this, this, this mixed platform thing is going to be-
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.000]   >> It's going to be a, it's going to be a problem.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:27.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:27.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:27.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.600]   >> It's, but, but again, it's why they can iterate so fast.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.800]   So it is, it is both the strength and the weakness of it.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.760]   And you know, this is, Microsoft had this problem in the early days of PCs,
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.000]   and Microsoft had to act very aggressively to do things like DirectX,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.920]   and, and make sure that there was a standard.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.680]   This is what Google's going to have to do is say,
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.920]   no, look, we've got to have a consistent, reliable OpenGL implementation
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.000]   that can be written to across all platforms.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.720]   Screen, differences in screen sizes, I don't think is the issue.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.320]   I, I think the problem really is because it's a cell phone,
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.200]   you've got carriers and manufacturers modifying it.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.440]   And they can't stop that because it's open.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.520]   And that's, I think that's the real, real problem.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.600]   But, well, we've come a long way, haven't we,
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.360]   or since the early days of Nokia?
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.720]   I mean, this, this, these phones are fairly, very powerful.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.720]   Nokia looking for a new CEO, in fact, because they, they have just been suffering.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.120]   I guess the iPhone.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:20.440]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.600]   >> Share price is down 40% since April.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:22.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.360]   >> That's great.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.240]   >> It's too bad.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.880]   I mean, they, they have Symbian, which is a, I think a very nice OS.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   They've got MAMO, which I haven't been too happy with on the N900.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.720]   It's a little heavyweight for a, for a portable device.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.000]   But, but they've got some, some, some, some useful stuff.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.920]   And, and of course they still sell more handsets than anybody in the world.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.280]   >> So this is an interesting step, by the way,
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.320]   for talking about developing for these different mobile platforms
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:58.840]   that I just picked up on Twitter, where the months to mastery for a developer to master a mobile
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.720]   platform. Symbian, 15 months.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.720]   iPhone, seven and a half months.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.560]   Android, only five months.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.960]   So where did that come from?
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.880]   >> Let me check.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.560]   >> Need for Speed Shift is in fact in the Android market.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.680]   Gina, you can get it.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.600]   >> Oh, nice.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.920]   [laughter]
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.280]   >> So this is a tech crunch article.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.120]   So this is from a tech crunch article.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.240]   >> Tech crunch, interesting.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.360]   >> Yeah, they're, uh, really.
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.680]   >> Well, Gina and I are both, you know, I mean, Gina is a real developer.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.840]   I'm just a toy, but, um, Gina and I have both been learning Android.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.000]   I don't find it a particularly difficult learning curve.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.280]   Java is very straightforward.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.360]   I think a lot of people have trouble with Objective-C.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.000]   There are a lot more Java developers out there.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.840]   A lot of people know Eclipse.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.800]   It's not difficult to use.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   The framework, I think, it seems very strong.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.080]   I don't know if it's buggy, but it seems like it's got a lot of features.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.840]   The library seemed very, very well developed.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.320]   You got a great bunch of people working on it.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.600]   It's a mature OS.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.920]   I would expect it to be competitive.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.720]   >> So just for the source of that information,
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:07.880]   this is a research report by Vision Mobile called Developer Economics 2010,
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.560]   and it's free, available online.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.920]   >> Very interesting.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.400]   >> Cool.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.080]   >> All right.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.120]   Any, uh, let's see, any other big stories that I've missed there quite a few.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:18.520]   >> Um.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.560]   >> I have so many tabs open.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.760]   I can't even see now.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:22.760]   >> I know.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.560]   >> Which one is the--
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.600]   >> I mentioned the--
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:29.240]   Apple's big earnings, I guess we could say,
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:33.080]   that there is no doubt that Apple is still a very strong player
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.720]   and getting stronger all the time.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.560]   And in a way, that is validation of their closed platform.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.680]   I think people perceive it as more secure,
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.400]   safer, perhaps more elegant and easy to use.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.560]   >> Yet, ironically, the US Special Forces,
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.040]   the latest story on the front feed,
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.200]   has selected Android to be their platform for experimentation.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.440]   >> Yeah, this is the app that I want.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.480]   It's called RAT.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.080]   >> This is-- this is-- they have one called RATs,
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.120]   Rafeon Android Tactical System.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:02.920]   >> Can I get it?
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.240]   >> Does it allow me to do a pilot predator drone?
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.200]   >> All of your levers.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.560]   >> So you could pick up aerial images for unmanned aircraft and satellites,
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.000]   and then focus it on details such as license plates on cars and physical features,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.360]   and then you can follow or buddy a device.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.880]   So you can follow, for example, a plane and constantly watch what it's doing.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.800]   >> And the--
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.120]   >> And the--
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   >> The--
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   >> The--
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:24.600]   >> The--
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   >> The--
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   >> The--
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   >> The--
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   >> It's--
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.120]   >> The--
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:25.880]   >> It's the following members of the crew.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.960]   >> According to RATheon's vice president of business development,
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.720]   Mark Bingham, Android was selected due to its open source,
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.120]   nature, which made developing applications easy.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.200]   So there--
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.720]   >> There you go.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.680]   >> There are rewards.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.840]   >> You know, I think that there's proof is in the pudding,
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.480]   and look how fast the Android marketplace is growing
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.080]   compared to the iPhone marketplace.
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:47.480]   And in fact, at this pace, it's-- in a year,
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.800]   there'll be more apps on Android.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.320]   >> But again, I think the problem remains that quantity and--
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.360]   quality is going to win.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.960]   >> Well, I have to say as somebody who, you know, does both,
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.240]   that most--
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:16:59.800]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.880]   >> At first, a year ago, that was a big complaint was I can't get mint,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.200]   I can't get recall, I can't get audible,
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.840]   I can't get a lot of things that I want on Android.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.520]   But the-- for the most part, those have disappeared.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.400]   >> Yeah, that's true.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.040]   >> That's true.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.200]   >> The big apps that I really need are available.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.840]   Another interesting stat that I just read on Twitter yesterday was,
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.920]   I don't know if you guys noticed this, but a prediction
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:32.600]   that by the year 2012, I believe, there was going to be a bigger market
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.440]   in the apps--
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.680]   app stores in Middle East and Africa than in North America.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.040]   >> Well, and that's again where open development is going to really help
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.800]   these developers around the world be a part of this.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.360]   They're, you know, 99 bucks to become part of the Apple developer team,
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.800]   and you have to have a Macintosh.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.440]   And I mean, this, you can develop for Android on Linux, Mac, or Windows, equally well.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.120]   That by itself should make a difference, right?
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.040]   >> Yep.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:02.120]   >> All right.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.880]   Enough of that.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.680]   Let's move on.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.920]   We are going to get our number and our tool and our tip of the week.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.920]   Let's start with Gina Trapani because I'm dying for a tip on Google Images.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.800]   >> Google Images has been revamped and it's rolling out slowly.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.760]   I am getting it.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.120]   Jeff says he's not getting it.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:20.520]   >> Really?
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.280]   >> I hear that if you click on, if you go to the official Google blog
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.360]   and you click on the link in their post about it,
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.680]   that it'll set the cookie or do whatever it can say.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.760]   >> Ah, it looks like I've always gotten tool ups.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.120]   >> Yeah, tool ups like you always get tool ups.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.080]   Ah, that's too bad.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.360]   >> Yeah, look at that.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.400]   And not only that, it's an endless stream of Gina Trapani.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.240]   >> Yeah, it's an endless scroll.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.840]   So if you, and it's got keyboard shortcuts, right?
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.400]   So if you hit page down, it'll just, you know,
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.240]   you'll just keep getting more images and you never have to click to the next page.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.680]   >> If you hover over it, you get this zoom up.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:54.600]   >> Yeah, it kind of, yeah, the thumbnail fills in,
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.480]   you get a little caption with some more information.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.320]   And then if you click on it, you'll see the image in context of the page that you found it.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.440]   >> I just think this is so cool.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.120]   >> For the little kind of overlay.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.160]   It's a really nice update.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.440]   And a thing that I hadn't realized, but they pointed out in the post about this,
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.080]   is that you can specify what color you want to see.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.840]   So like if I search for tomatoes, I can say I want to see green tomatoes,
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.960]   I want to see red tomatoes, yellow, black and white.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.880]   And it's pretty incredible.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.240]   Yeah, if you go to see, if you see the color palette there below,
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.240]   black and white, we don't have a lot of pictures of people.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.400]   So these are predominantly yellow pictures that I get when I search for Gina Trapani.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.800]   Isn't that bizarre?
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.080]   But it actually works.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.760]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.080]   So that's a really kind of fun little widget as well.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.560]   But yeah, I'm like in the paging down, paging up and down.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.600]   And the tiling, the images or the thumbnails are just denser.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.360]   So you get a lot more images on one page.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:53.160]   >> And if I just want pictures of your face, I click face and it just gives me face pictures.
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.480]   This is so cool.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.840]   Plus I can get social results.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.000]   I'm not sure how that's different, but.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.120]   >> Wait, would you click on the social search?
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.400]   >> I guess it's just Facebook.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.840]   These are Facebook results, yeah.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.600]   >> Interesting.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:13.320]   Any size, medium, large icon, larger than exactly any type face photo clip art.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.000]   Here's all the Gina Trapani clip art.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.120]   >> Wait, Gina, you've got a lot of glosses in there.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:18.920]   You have an acting career.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:19.560]   You haven't told us enough?
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.040]   >> Look at this.
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:20.520]   Look at this.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.560]   If we get Gina, they should have headshots.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.760]   Here's Gina's headshots.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.480]   This is her acting.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:25.800]   >> What the hell?
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.480]   What the hair do's through the time?
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:27.960]   >> I know.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.280]   >> I got this.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:28.760]   >> This is fascinating.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.760]   >> Hair's around here.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.840]   >> I'm sorry to make you the subject of this, Gina.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.160]   >> I know.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.360]   I'm blushing over here.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:34.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.400]   >> And you have a needle stuck into the middle of it.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.240]   >> Well, there's just weird every once in a while.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:39.880]   There's some weird--
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.840]   >> Something weird.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.280]   >> Like, here's Bill Gates with the crazy glasses.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.240]   But it says your name.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.360]   >> This is my name.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.000]   Well, there you go.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:47.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:47.800]   >> Yes.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.960]   You can see my bad hair through the years.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.760]   >> You have great hair.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.480]   What are you talking about?
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:51.880]   >> I'm great.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.920]   >> What are you talking about?
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.960]   >> I don't think you fix the issue.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.520]   Look, look, look.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.320]   >> I do too.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.160]   >> Everybody loves Gina Trapani.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.360]   Just get over it.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.560]   >> Oh, man.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.840]   >> Get over it.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.080]   All right.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.360]   Who else should I search for?
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:02.760]   Let's see.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.240]   Let's do--
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.080]   >> Let's search for Joan from "Jony from Mad Men."
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.520]   >> Joanie, what's her name?
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.040]   >> I think it's--
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:12.760]   what's the actress's name?
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.400]   I'm not sure what the actress is.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.080]   >> Well, I'll just search for "Jony from Mad Men."
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.440]   It's coming back this week, right?
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.400]   >> Yes.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:17.960]   >> Oh, don't we love her?
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.000]   >> I'm very excited.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:19.880]   >> Joan Holloway.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.360]   >> Oh.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.400]   >> She is my favorite.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.280]   >> Oh.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.000]   >> And if you specify red, you know, she's a red man.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.880]   >> She's going to only be red.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.320]   In fact, it looks like we got that anyway.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:27.880]   >> Yeah.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.120]   >> She's-- this is just Joan and Red.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.200]   I wonder if I specify green if we'll get--
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.600]   yeah, there's some--
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.440]   some Betty White pictures too, somehow.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.320]   Just snuck in there.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.960]   Isn't this incredible?
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.600]   >> It's fun.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.520]   You can spend some time with the new image search.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.000]   It's really neat.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:43.480]   >> I love it.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.560]   Very, very good tip.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.720]   And so you're--
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.960]   actually, the real tip is if you go to the Google blog
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.640]   and click on the link there, it'll set the cookie
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.360]   and you can have this.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.080]   You can own this.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.000]   >> I-- Jeff, did that work for you?
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.480]   That's what they--
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.360]   that's what my--
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.960]   my informants on "Life Hacker" were saying,
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.160]   but I'm not sure I had to try it.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:21:59.720]   >> Try it again.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.760]   >> Which blog is it on?
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.760]   >> It's on the official Google blog.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.240]   >> Sure.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.440]   >> And the post is--
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.720]   I don't think it's one down on the page.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.520]   >> I think, yeah.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.120]   >> Oh, Google image present.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.280]   >> Sibling search.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:10.840]   Sorry.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.800]   Ooh, okay.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.680]   >> So I clicked on the tulips.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.400]   >> Yeah, you can click on the leper into the particular--
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:15.720]   >> Oh, yeah, one time.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.200]   >> Did you get it?
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:18.600]   Awesome.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.000]   There you go.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:19.800]   >> I did.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.520]   >> Cool.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.800]   And by the way,
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.080]   and this is really why they might
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.200]   have to make this a big announcement.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.240]   Notice the ads for tulips at the top.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.600]   >> They--
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.560]   >> Here's the weird thing.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.320]   >> Well, I'm sorry.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:31.960]   >> No, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.320]   >> They see this as an opportunity
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.000]   to make a lot of money, obviously.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.680]   >> Yeah, the leper's example is really neat, too.
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:39.800]   >> Oh, let's look at that.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.360]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.200]   >> When I search for me,
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.480]   which, of course, is the first thing I do,
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.920]   I don't get me at all.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.400]   >> Well, you kind of work on it.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.200]   >> We can work.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:48.600]   >> Look at--
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:48.840]   >> I don't get--
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.480]   >> I don't get photos.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.920]   So that I put on face,
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.320]   and I get everybody but me.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.040]   >> See, now, because I did a certain kind of search,
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.560]   it narrowed down the options in the left.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.520]   But I can go back to reset tools,
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.280]   and I'll get all the other tools.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.800]   >> Yeah, Jeff, I have a page full of you.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.080]   I have-- there's a great photo of you
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.360]   making the funniest face.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.280]   >> Oh, now we got to do Jeff Jarvin.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.640]   >> That's a great job.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.200]   >> That's a great job.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.160]   >> I hate from Scoble.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:13.800]   Scoble took it.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.760]   It's the lowest everywhere.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.880]   I'm looking really sour.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.720]   >> Yeah, there you go.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.280]   >> Which one?
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.000]   >> The one where he has his hands up.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.280]   >> This one?
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.240]   >> I like this one.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:23.880]   >> Yeah, that one.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.440]   >> Yeah, that one.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:24.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.640]   >> Wow, what would Google do?
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.080]   >> Wow, wow.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.760]   >> That's from the Neiman Journal as a lab.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.200]   >> Wow, what would Google do?
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.760]   Wow, I love it.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.040]   >> This is the one I hate.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.200]   It's on the top row, third for left.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:42.680]   >> That is not a good picture.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.120]   That's the Scoble picture.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.600]   >> Scoble has won the average on my Wikipedia.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.560]   It's one of my movies.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.520]   And I hate it.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.480]   It looks like we've got--
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.000]   >> Because he made a creative comment.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.560]   >> The weird man.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.840]   >> The key is to have somebody--
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.760]   >> And somebody has to take a good photo
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.800]   and make you create a comment.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.840]   >> Creative comments, that's exactly.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.440]   >> I think it looked very distinguished in that, Jeff.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:23:59.720]   >> He hate it.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.840]   >> I love there's a Jeff Wertle in here.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.600]   And I love that we're Googling ourselves.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.440]   And I'm going to go-- I'm going to do Leo.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.400]   >> Googled.me.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.520]   >> Leo, do yourself.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.120]   >> No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.920]   >> I wanted to--
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.520]   >> I'm the advantage of controlling the switcher.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.880]   >> Oh, he's not drawing a dream.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.640]   >> I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.760]   >> Your number is a week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.400]   >> Oh, yes, a nice fate there, Leo.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.520]   Oh, yeah, real time.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.720]   Get with myself.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.600]   All right.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.240]   So John Patel did some analysis of the numbers out there
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:35.240]   on the sales of the phones and says that 3 million iPhones
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.680]   sold in 23 days works out to 130,000 phones a day.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.560]   But Google has announced that they're activating 160,000
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.800]   Android devices every day.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.320]   30 came more per day.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.800]   And he took another number and divided and found a $100,000
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.040]   gap with Android ahead.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.280]   So he's figuring that iPhone can only slow down now.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.360]   And Android is an ends up on more and more devices
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.520]   and more places it's really going to speed up.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:05.480]   And Android's going to win on market share.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.840]   >> I truly think this analogy is apt.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.440]   >> That Android is Windows.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:15.160]   And the iPhone is going to be a narrow niche market
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.320]   for people who really want to spend a little bit more
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.040]   and care a little bit more about fit and finish perhaps.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.960]   Or just want that feeling of superiority that they own an iPhone.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:27.560]   But this is going to be the smartphone for the masses.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.840]   I have to think that.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.360]   >> Smart phone and device.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.520]   It's going to power everything from tablets to cars to
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.560]   to droids in Afghanistan.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.120]   >> Because it's open.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:38.600]   It's free.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.720]   It'll be everywhere.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:45.880]   And it's kind of interesting because Apple has again dug this hole for itself.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.440]   I remember Steve Jobs telling me when he was still at Pixar,
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:52.760]   we had the lead when we came out in 1984 with a Macintosh.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.200]   And we didn't innovate fast enough and Microsoft caught up.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.720]   And I think history is repeating itself.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.440]   >> Yeah.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.560]   >> I really do.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.240]   So my pick of the week is actually in response to getting this Droid X
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:11.000]   and not being so crazy about the Motorola Blur.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.760]   All of these have launchers on them.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.720]   The Nexus One is the only one that's just pure Google launcher.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.880]   There's the HTC Sense.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.080]   There's a Motorola Blur.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.440]   Samsung has its own.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.200]   The Blur isn't awful, but I just kind of missed my Nexus experience.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.000]   And then I found a program called Launcher Pro.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.920]   And this is free in the marketplace right now.
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.520]   And I have to warn you, if you're going to put it on the Nexus One,
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.840]   you can go back and forth because the Nexus One gives you access to the launcher in the apps.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.920]   And so you can choose.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.880]   But once you put this on Motorola, there's no way to go back.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.920]   One of the things I don't like about Motorola is that they don't put their own applications
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.480]   in the application directory.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.280]   And so you cannot change the default.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.200]   So perhaps not something you should do.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.480]   I did it as an experiment.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.600]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.600]   Launcher Pro Plus is out for $1.99, gives you some additional features.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.040]   But look at one of the things I can do.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.800]   I can change this dock.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.960]   I now have a scrollable dock with a variety of icons in the bottom here.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:12.040]   You can make it be just like the default dock, but you can do more with it.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.280]   Also, you might have noticed I have five rows of icons, which is great.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.040]   And I've taken the labels off the icons.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.440]   So even though I have five rows, it's very spacious.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.400]   You can have anywhere from one to seven home screens.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.480]   And it has a lot of additional features in the preferences for how the appearance looks.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:36.520]   There's a variety of different little switches, on/off switches and so forth.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.400]   You can change the number of screens, the default home screen.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.320]   You can turn trackball on and off.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.440]   You can control the dock.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:48.120]   I have tried a lot of launchers and to always take them off because they bog the system down.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.200]   They make it a little bit odd.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.600]   But the author of this, I think, has done a very good job.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.760]   His name is Frederico Carnales.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.440]   And I think he's been working on this for several months.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.680]   And I think he's done just a superb job of this.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.720]   There's some very nice features that I think.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.080]   And this is, again, this is the advantage of an open system.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.320]   I can change the entire look and feel.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.800]   So even though this is a Motorola Droid X,
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.680]   it doesn't have any of the feel of the Motorola Droid.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.120]   The Motorola widgets are still available, but they're also in the launcher pro,
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.720]   some new widgets that he's putting out.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.240]   I just think this is a very nice feature.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.640]   If you have a Nexus One, it's probably a no-brainer to at least try it out.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:33.000]   My caution to those of you who want to try it out on phones where you cannot change the default launcher.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.960]   You could tell that, by the way, by going into the systems settings and running applications.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.040]   And if you can see in managed applications, if you can see the launcher,
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.720]   then you can always go back to the launcher.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.280]   But if you can't see the launcher in your list of applications,
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.720]   a change to the launcher will require a resetting of the entire machine.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.200]   You'll have to kind of reinstall everything.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.520]   I don't currently want to.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.400]   I'm very happy with this.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.680]   This is launcher pro from Frederico Carnales.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.800]   Carnales, it is free $1.99 for the pro version.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.360]   I have not been able to download the pro version yet,
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.320]   because he has a little bit of a bug in his downloader.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.760]   That is making it impossible to install on the Droid X.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.440]   But I've sent him a note, I'm sure he will.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.600]   And he's working on some really interesting additional widget features.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:23.480]   And I'm sure they're telling me in the chatroom if I use Home Switcher,
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.800]   or something I should be able to change the launcher.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.400]   And it's possible that I should be able to do that.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.280]   I just haven't figured out ways to mess around with that.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.360]   But I haven't had much impetus to do that.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:36.040]   Really cool. It's nice to have a scrollable dock at the bottom there.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.720]   Launch your pro. That's my pick.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.960]   We are out of time.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.720]   Yuri, I'd really want to thank you for joining us.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.040]   As always, you add immensely to the conversation.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.640]   Thanks.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:52.840]   Yuri, blogs at zenghastrum, z-e-n-g-e-s-t-r-e-o-m.com.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.120]   You can find that by just searching for his name or searching for his
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:56.600]   Angostrum.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.160]   And he's going to write more.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:29:59.960]   I'm sure he is.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.960]   He also is a Twitterer.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.400]   What is your Twitter handle, Yuri?
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.800]   It's my first name, J-y-r-i.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.960]   J-y-r-i. He's the only one.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.640]   Thank you for joining us, Yuri.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.440]   It's really great to see you.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.640]   Thanks.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.400]   Gina Tripani blogs at smarterwear.org.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.360]   And as also the author of the great book,
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:23.320]   The Complete Guide to Google Wave, at completewaveguide.com.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.680]   One million users strong.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.080]   And Happy Birthday to us.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:27.800]   One year old.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.520]   One year old.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.400]   Well, wait a second.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.040]   Wait a second.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.200]   Isn't actually next week's birthday?
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.680]   Next week we begin our second year.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.040]   So I guess it would be our first.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.480]   You're just in very heavy labor right now.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:44.040]   It's much easier to birth a podcast than a person.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:44.840]   Let me tell you that.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.000]   A year ago I was terrified.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.040]   Were you?
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:48.360]   Come on.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.800]   Were you really scared when you first-
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:49.800]   I was.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.240]   I had never done streaming video.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.800]   I had never done video online at all.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:54.600]   So this was a big-
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:55.960]   And you're comfortable-
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.560]   You're comfortable now, right?
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.080]   I love it now.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.280]   I'm much more comfortable with it.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.160]   But I was all worried about hearing my own voice.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.600]   And yeah.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.000]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.840]   And the author of What Will Google Do soon.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.560]   Public Parts.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.680]   Jeff, thank you for being here.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.880]   Thank you.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.000]   We thank you all for joining us.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.120]   We invite you to come back.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.280]   We do this every Wednesday at 1 p.m.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:19.400]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time at live.tuit.tv
