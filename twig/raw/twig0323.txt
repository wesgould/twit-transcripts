[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, a show where we talk about the Google
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   verse. Jeff Jarvis is in London, England.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.360]   It's late at night. He's in his hotel. Hello Jeff.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   Hey, looks like quite a comfy hotel.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   It's the airport hotel. I have a flight tomorrow morning to Mexico City.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   You were in the week from hell, aren't you? I've been in a month from hell.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   So the first stop was London. What were you doing there?
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.360]   Uh, the Quadcast. Oh, fun. Which was really a lot of fun that I had a meeting that I ate at the
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   dinner at the Frontline Club, a journalist club. That's called Tomorrow I Fly to Mexico City via
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   Houston for when if for World Association newspapers. Next week it's Berlin for News Exchange.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   The week after that is Lagos Johannesburg, Miami. And the week after that it's Phoenix for
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   News guys. Holy cow. What? What? Wait a minute. That sounds like
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   Gina Trippani. I must just be here. Oh my God. It is. Oh my God. It is. Hi Gina.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   Today I traveled from my bedroom to my home office.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   And I did make it to the Bodega for a coffee. So it's been a lot of traveling for me.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   How are you? Great to see you. Thank you so much. We miss you. We've been super good miles.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   Yes, exactly. Yeah. I put on a few steps in Google Fit. That's about it.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   And that's not to be knocked. That's not at all accounts. It all counts.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   Yeah. I'm on my Android Wear watch today. I have in honor of back to the future day.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   I have a flux capacitor. It even has a little time. Oh ribbon. It says shield eyes from light.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   And I think you can I think you can set it to travel through time.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   That's on. Yeah. It is back to the future day. And we're so pleased to welcome Matt Cuts to the table.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   Hey, are you still home, Matt? You still at home? I am calling from Omaha this week.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   What Nebraska? Yeah. Is this for family? That's where the involves are. Yeah.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   I think they have better connectivity than you do, Matt.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   I'm very clear. If I'm like, can we get Google fiber in the Midwest just out of curiosity?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   Yeah. Well, we were talking before the show about the new Nexus phones. And I guess 5x and 6p went out for review to select reviewers across the country.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   Our own Jason Howell got a review unit. He's working on the 6p review for before you buy this week.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   And I just thought I brought I brought in my old Nexus 6 just to kind of compare and contrast.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   So the Nexus 6 is bigger, obviously, 6 inch screen. This is a 5.7 inch screen.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   But I think in many respects, I mean, this is plastic bag. Shammu. We loved you. But I think the time has come to take a look at the next generation of Nexus and boy.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   I can't wait to hear your review, Jason, but I'm just impressed as heck. Any previews, Jason? What do you think in so far?
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   I'm really, really liking the device. No surprise. I mean, the design of the device with kind of the aluminum body and everything just feels really nice.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   It's heavy, but that's okay. It gives us sense of quality. Yeah, exactly. I don't mind a little bit of weight because it makes me feel, at least in my brain, it makes me feel like it's got a solid build.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   It's not hollow and empty. The camera bump at the top that everybody freaked out about, not nearly as pronounced as you might fear, although it might still bug some people.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   It's there. It's there. It's not like it's not. And it's ironic because this whole right side is unnecessary. The camera, the flash, and the sensor on the left. Really, there's stuff over here.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.360]   They packed that full of stuff. Oh, there is stuff. Yeah, there might be antennas in there.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   That's where pretty much all the antennas reside as well as the camera. There's a plastic bottom here. There's other places where the antenna can leak out, but okay.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   Yeah, they put it all up there in that little window. Stereo speakers. Like that.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   The speakers sound great, especially compared to the Nexus 6. My car stereo is broken right now. So if I want to listen to anything, it's through the speakers on full blast.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   I've actually really noticed a difference between the two. It's not something I normally spend a lot of time with. And I have on this timer.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   Let's play some music through here. I do love front-facing speakers. I think those are... Oh, it's got an ad. That's all right. I'm going to turn it all the way up.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   That's one thing that's changed.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   Don't skip ad. You don't mind.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   Little Wayne. Hello, little Wayne. Did you just start, I'm feeling lucky or something?
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   Sounds good. I mean, it's not super bassy.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   Yeah, you're not going to get bass out of any of these speakers necessarily, but...
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   I'm flexing on them like toss those...
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   Oh, good!
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   I'm feeling unlucky now.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   I was worried about that.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   Fingerprint sensor is really, really nice. It's on the back.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   It's so fast.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   Some people said...
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   The only other problem with having it on the back is then... That's enough, thank you.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   Oh, Trap Queen, I like that.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   Is that you can't use it on the front, but big deal. I mean, I don't think that's a big deal.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   And you can also do the thing, which I always do, where if it's at a trusted location or tied to a trusted Bluetooth device, it doesn't lock at all.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   So, presumably, if it's in your office, sitting on a desk or whatever, you're not going to be locked in.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   With all of those extra security features that you can activate in Lollipop and Marshmallow.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   Yeah, what I've realized is I don't enter my pin anymore, because the fingerprint is sufficient.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   And I don't always have to use my fingerprint because I've got all the other things active.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   So, depends on how comfortable you feel.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   I have it in my vent and the car, because the ways are my means of getting around.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   And I just fear having to take it off, but my finger on.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   That's true.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   Although it's new...
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.360]   The time to your car's Bluetooth, and you see that that's a trusted Bluetooth.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   Oh, cars, what?
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   Oh, never mind.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   That's right. You don't have to.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   Do you have a watch?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   If it works with steam-powered engines, it might be okay, but...
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   Well, there you go.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   Sing it to your watch, and then if it's near you...
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   Because, oh, yeah, I've been waiting to get a car with Android Auto.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   Right, right.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   I can't get any straight answers out of Audi about when the heck is coming, no car at once.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   So, you'll probably put a case on it.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   So, slipperiness is not really a big issue, I don't think.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   I spent a day without the case, and the whole time I was afraid.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   Yeah, it feels very slick on the back here.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   So, I put that case on this morning.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   I think it was this morning, and I actually really liked the case a lot, but it makes me feel at least a little bit more comfortable that I'm not going to do what I did to my Nexus 6 with this.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   Is it one of the ones they sell on the side?
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   Yeah, it is.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   It's actually, you know, it was part of the review unit package is what's on it.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   Yeah, this is clear.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   It says Nexus.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   This is clearly at Google.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   It's really nice.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   It feels really nice.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   How about storage enough, you think?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   This is a 64 gig phone.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   Yeah, well, this one's the 16.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   The review unit, I believe, is the 16.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   So, what is it?
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   16?
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   No, I don't think so.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   So, it says 12.3 gigabytes used at 5.3.3.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.360]   Oh, so it's the 64.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   It's the 64.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   Okay, so it's 32, 64, and 128.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   You know, I mean, you don't have a micro SD, so it depends on how much you're storing on the device.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   I think 64 is perfectly sufficient for me.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   Absolutely.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   But you have a 128 option if you really need to go big.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   Right.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   Main thing I care about battery life.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   Battery?
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   Okay, so here's where I have a disclaimer.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   I was going to be reviewing this week.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   I'm not now because this device is faulty, actually.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   There was something going on yesterday where my battery was going really wacko.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   When I reboot it, it gives me, before the Google logo, it gives me this big red asterisk,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   and it says, "Your device is corrupt."
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   Oh, that's the boot protection.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   There's something weird going on with it.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   I contacted Google PR.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   They're sending me a replacement device, so my review is going to be next week.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   I don't want to place any judgments on this device.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   Life is a story.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   Life is a story.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   I'm just going to say...
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   I'm just going to say...
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   This way, Leo can play with one.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.360]   7 a.m. you took it off just before 7 a.m.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   You still have 60% left.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   They think you're going to get past midnight.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   I think that's pretty reasonable.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   That's all I would ask if I could just get through the day.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   Yesterday I took it off at 7 and by 3 it was like 13%.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   But that, again, yours was wack wonky.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   Yes, exactly.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   That's what I mean.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   Like, I was like, "Okay, that doesn't sound right compared to what I've heard from people,
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   so I'm going to get a new unit and do a French."
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   And you've been using this one or not.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   Yeah, I've been using that one.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   So this is, you know, that's decent slope.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   I would say so.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   And, you know, it has the fast charge capability, so you can charge it up super quick.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   Yeah, like Type C.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   So, Matt cuts his get.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   He's getting the 6P, not the 5X, right?
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   I ordered the 5X and now I'm like, "Maybe I'll order the 6P and decide whether...
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   which one or...
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   Maybe I'll just have a house phone, you know, and then one for going out, you know."
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   That's one way to solve the battery problem.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   I have my evening phone.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   I think the battery life I've been hearing from reviews on the 5X is not so hot.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   It's okay.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   Yeah, so I think that you want...
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   And, you know what, this doesn't...
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   Boy, especially compared to Shamo, this doesn't feel that big.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   No, you know what, it's a little narrower, but it's a little taller.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   And I think between the two, I think that's the better way to go.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   The Nexus 6 just felt two unwieldy when you were doing one-handed operation.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   And the 6P, I mean, that small change in narrowness actually makes a huge difference.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   I can't wait.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   This is, I think, this is going to be my go-to phone.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   For a month.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   And the camera?
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.360]   For a month.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   Hey, that's all you have to say.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   Hey, we know you well.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   That's my life.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   Come on one time and leave a little.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.360]   It's a lot of months.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   Oh my God, that's incredible.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.360]   Well, the iPhone... I've been using the iPhone 6S Plus, which I really like.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   And battery life on that is amazing.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.360]   But if I can get through the day, that's all I need.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   That's all I care about.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   It feels really premium.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   Yeah, it really does.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   It's nice.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   The screen is fantastic.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   It's a Samsung panel.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   The latest, basically Samsung panel.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   So right on par with what you get in the Note 5.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   Yeah, everything pops.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   It's nice.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.360]   It feels fairly swift.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   But is this the replacement or is this...
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   No, this is still the faulty.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   So it still might be messed up.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   So keep that in mind.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   Oops, can't capture this.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   I got to do the lens blur thing.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   All right.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   Slowly raise your device.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   Keep the subject.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   All right.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   Now I can change the focus to here.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   Or to there.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.360]   Or I don't know, I guess not.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.360]   I think you've got a little...
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   It's still processing.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   Nice.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   Now we don't have the 5X in studio.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   But...
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   Gina...
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   What?
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   So you went with the little one.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   I did.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   I went with the little one.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   I've had this thing for three hours.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   All right.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   Give us a full review.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   Top to bottom.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   We want no details.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   I love it so far.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   Well, this is my first experience with the fingerprint sensor.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360]   So, you know, unlocking the phone, that's one thing.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   That's going to be nice.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   But for me, it's a last pass.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.360]   I am always typing in my super long last pass password.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   Just being able to tap my fingerprint.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   Oh, so much better.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.360]   I also had the first time experience, the thing where you take your old phone and you tap it to your new phone.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.360]   And it's just like, "Bloop."
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.360]   And it just sets up your new phone with everything.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   That was amazing.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   Have you guys done that?
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   It's actually one of the winning features of Android, I think.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   And something you don't get with the OnePlus 2 because they left out NFC, right?
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   Right.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.360]   Yeah, that was really, really nice.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   I have had weightier phones.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   This feels kind of light and plasticky to me.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.360]   And I'm kind of like chasing it.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   It is really light.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   It's like the car door thing, right?
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   They try to like add weight to car doors because people perceive that the car is a higher quality.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   If the door is a little heavy and it has that like chunk when you close it.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360]   Same deal with phones for me.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   So, it feels a little bit flimsy because I'm just used to a giant phone.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   But I'm really happy to have a one-handed device.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   And I don't know.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   I'm interested to see how battery life is.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   Like I said, I just charged it and arrived today and I just charged it a couple hours ago.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   So I'm still kind of on my way around.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   So I'm playing with the blur thing.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.360]   So I'm making that in focus.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   Now I'm going to make this in focus.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.360]   It's pretty fast.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.360]   Nice.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   I feel like this is a...
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   Because that's built into...
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.360]   That's in the camera.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.360]   It's one of the camera settings.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.360]   So the camera is very simple, but I like that and I'll mind that.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   You get a timer, you get an HDR, it's an auto by default.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   You get flash.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.360]   You get a menu here that gives you a photosphere panorama lens blur.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   You get a larger setting, but it's a very simple camera with video choices.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   UHD 4K HD 1080p, HD 720p, and you can also do slow-mo, right?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   Yep.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   I haven't tested that yet, actually.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   I forgot about that.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   It's a stabilization built-in.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   This is nice.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   Nice.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   I like the way you get to video on this, by the way.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   You just swipe it right, right?
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.360]   Yep.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   Left to right or the other way to switch modes.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.360]   Well, I heard one complaint was that with the double tap of the power button to turn on the...
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   Yeah, that's kind of weird, isn't it?
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   Because it locks it and then it opens it up in camera, but now you've locked the phone.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   Is that true?
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   Well, let's see.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   Actually, I can't tell because this phone doesn't have a lock.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   I mean, you're in camera.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   What more do you want?
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   And with a fingerprint reader, it unlocks pretty darn quick.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   I wouldn't...
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   It is locked again.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   Lack of OIS is an issue, but...
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   Yeah, I would agree.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   And Google had explained...
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   They had a Reddit AMA a few weeks back, and they had explained that basically the larger,
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   the larger pixel size helps to improve that.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   That's what HTC said with the M.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   With a one, right?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   I just feel like no matter what you get more stable images with OIS, so that is a loss.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   But...
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   I did order a new SIM because if you're a Google Fi user, you have to get the new SIM to use with the new phones.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.360]   Really?
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   They warned me about that.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   If you want to...
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   I think if you stay with the Nexus 6, you're fine, but if you want to go with the 6P or the 5X,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   then they'd like to have a new SIM.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   Are these your pictures of the JSON?
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   So this is a slow-mo of a hummingbird shot with the 6P.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   Is this yours?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   No, this is not mine.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.360]   This was a demo footage released before the devices hit anyone's hands.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   Isn't that cool?
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   That is really cool.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   Holy moly.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   That's...
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   I love Matt's Google cackle.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.360]   Damn, we're smart.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   Dang.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   We're good.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   So Jeff, if it makes you feel better, I also ordered a ludicrous speed Chromebook Pixel this week because I'm like,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   I don't want any more lag when I'm on this week on Google.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   I want to like...
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   Thank you.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   I got to refresh everything.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   Thank you.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   So we love that.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   I love that Chromebook Pixel.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   I really do.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   That's an awesome, awesome device.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   Yeah, I got the ludicrous speed.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.360]   I can't wait for my Pixel C, but I can't order it yet.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   So...
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   Right.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   So sooner or later.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   All right.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   Let's get to the news of the week.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:53.360]   Jack Dorsey, the new CEO of Twitter apologizes to developers and says he wants to reset relations.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   This is what...
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   Well, maybe too late since it was a while ago when under Dick Costolo, the third party developers were bumped.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   Here's a perfect example.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.360]   Was it fully under Dick or did it start beforehand?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.360]   No, I thought it was beforehand too.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   Nick Bilton was here.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   He said, "No, no, it was all Dick."
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   He wanted to talk about it.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   Well, but then it says here Dorsey's decision to dial back that relationship.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   Oh, no, this is his current decision.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   All right.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.360]   Going forward, the company says it will improve its communications with developers.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   We want to make sure we have a great relationship with our developers and open an honest relationship
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   with developers.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   It's not about relationship.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   It's about APIs.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   It's about access.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   Who cares about the relationship?
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   Well, you know, Gina's a developer.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   Gina's also a very forgiving, nice person.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   She never slammed them.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   You didn't.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   Did you feel...
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   But think up wasn't a third party app.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.360]   That's really who got screwed, right?
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   It was not a client app.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:04.360]   So my co-founder, O'Neill, who actually Jack quoted during his intro today, which was crazy,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   called The Matrix of Doom.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Do you remember The Matrix where it's like client apps are not allowed, right?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   But everything else.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   So we were in an allowed quadrant, because think up was an analytics app, which in fact,
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.360]   Twitter made quite a few announcements today that are huge for us.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.360]   I mean, they're making all kinds of new insight data available to developers.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   So I'm really interested to dive into that.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   But, you know, I think that Twitter really did screw up at that time.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   I mean, whether or not client developers were the biggest slice of the developer pie for
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   Twitter, they were at least the very most vocal.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   And people love, you know, individuals love their power Twitter clients.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   And the fact that they were great clients out there that were getting killed because they
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   couldn't give out a number of tokens was awful.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   And it made people...
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   Listen, hey, when Neneel and I were going around pitching investors on ThinkUp, you know,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.360]   we were getting...
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   Are you sure you're going to build against the Twitter API?
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.360]   What if Twitter decides to pull a rug out from under you?
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.360]   I mean, these are the questions we were getting from investors.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.360]   So Twitter screwed up their relationship with investors.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   And I think that Jack...
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   I was impressed that Jack started out with that statement today.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.360]   I'd like to see him say client developers go crazy.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   We screwed up.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.360]   You know, I'd like to see them, you know, offer more on their REST API.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   I mean, think up in a lot of apps use their kind of plain old REST API.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   They're really committed to fabric and their mobile SDKs.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   And they announced a lot of cool stuff today.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   But now I'm interested to see, like you said, Leo, I'd like to see the access to the APIs change,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   and not just the words.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.360]   But isn't it also just about...
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   It's about assurances.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   I have the same exact discussion, of course, with news organizations and Facebook,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   and to some extent, Google.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   And there's no forever, but you need some assurance over time that we're doing this.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   And we're gonna...
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   And we know you're gonna build on it.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   We know you're gonna use it, and we're not gonna screw you.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   That's really what matters.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360]   No, it's true.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   It's true.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   And, you know, I have kind of defended Twitter in the past because, I mean, I think out of
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.360]   all the big companies, Twitter set an example very early on with their super easy API tools
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   as a great API.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.360]   I mean, developers love Twitter and would, you know, could build, you know, with one curl
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.360]   command of the command line, you know, get back to JSON or XML payload, you know, very early on.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   I think a lot of people cut their teeth on the Twitter API developing web services through
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   APIs because of Twitter.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   And, you know, in companies like Facebook, you know, change their API and kill access to
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   various bits of data, which they do a lot, you know, for privacy reasons or whatever.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   No one really blinks an eye because I think people just kind of expect Facebook to be
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   jerks, but because Twitter was so beloved in the developer community, I think they felt
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   a deep sense of betrayal when the Matrix could doom hit.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.360]   So I don't know.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   I'd like to see Twitter try to repair that relationship.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   You know, just removing token limits would probably be a great start.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.360]   Absolutely.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   Absolutely.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   Yeah, that 10,000 token limit.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   I mean, no one would know one in their right mind is building, you know, or innovating
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   on it on a good Twitter client because you hit, I think it's 10,000, right?
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   I mean, if you're, I think it's a hundred thousand if you're grandfathered in and yeah,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   something's less than that.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   Imagine, imagine what Twitter could be today if they hadn't screwed up with the developers.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   Imagine what developers could have built with Twitter.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   It'd be awe-inspiring, I think.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.360]   I think there's a lost opportunity.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   You're right.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   May I ever not come back, but at least I'm really happy that Jack's doing this.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.360]   But you could make the argument that it was because of this that they were able to monetize,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   right?
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   By getting rid of the third party clients, they forced people to use Twitter's own app
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   and their website where they could directly monetize, which is hard to do with the third
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   party client.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   They cherry picked the best ones and acquired them and then shot down access, right?
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   For new client developers.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   And yeah, the reasoning was, hey, there has to be an easy experience.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   People should be able to go to an app store and get the Twitter app.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   And I get that.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   I mean, Twitter was going through, it was a very different time in Twitter's history when
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   that all happened.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   Twitter was just trying to reach regular people.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   I think that that's less of an issue now.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   So, yeah, I'd like to see.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   A hundred thousand users, if you're a new Twitter application, you get a hundred thousand users
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   and that's it.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   Okay.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.680]   If you were already in, if you already had a hundred thousand users by the time they cut
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.880]   this off in 2012, you could get twice your current user base and then you're cut off.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.360]   So, if you were a third party Twitter client, you could never do more than double.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   And there was no reason to do a new one because you could never have more than a hundred thousand
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   users.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   Well, that's a lot more reasonable than 10,000, which is what I said.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:47.640]   Yeah, but still, well, it was enough to end third party Twitter client development, right?
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.280]   I mean, there are a few companies that were already in the business that have stayed in
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.280]   the business, but the rest of them.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.520]   And the other thing you could do is you could attach a business model to an API, right?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.560]   You can say that, I mean, it could have cut a couple of ways.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.440]   It could have said Twitter demands these requirements for advertising in any client, but it also
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.600]   could have said and you client makers could make money if you follow these rules.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.000]   It could have helped build the business more, I think.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.160]   It could have made Twitter more embeddable in other places.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.920]   That's what Twitter's culture was.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.960]   The hashtag and the @ sign we all know were not made by Twitter.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.160]   They were made by outsiders.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.080]   And that's so key to the cultural history of Twitter.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.600]   And that's what they betrayed.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.960]   But again, if you're a developer at this point, I think it might be too late.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.200]   There's plenty other places you can develop for, right?
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.240]   It might take a chance.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:53.560]   He did tweet, he wants to hear your ideas and requests using the hashtag #HelloWorld.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   I don't know.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.400]   That's an interesting choice.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:03.080]   Yeah, he kicked off the flight today by saying that Hello World is obviously the thing that
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.800]   most people figure out how to output when they're first learning to program.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.560]   And he feels like it really embodies what Twitter is because it's a global communications.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.400]   So they went with Hello World.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   I'm just kidding.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   I think I'm going to be seeing some of the responses.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   They're great.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   Yeah, they are.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   That's the one hashtag that won't be spammed with porn.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   Yeah, you could figure Twitter will get right on that.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   That's one thing to get right.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.680]   Hello World.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   Yeah, in fact, if I were, well, never mind.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.880]   I were of an evil mindset.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.240]   As long as we're in the Twitter, we'll move on and we'll get to Google in a moment because
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.400]   there's lots to talk about, lots to talk about.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.680]   But just a couple of other things.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:55.280]   Twitter has introduced polls, Twitter polls.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.720]   We heard rumors about this.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.200]   If you want the public's opinion, by the way, G plus does this beautifully.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.160]   Fairly similarly, I might add.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   You can create a poll.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.600]   Well, it's only about two choices, two responses.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   That's it.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   That's it.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   That lasts for 24 hours.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.600]   Two choices, 24 hours.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   Oh, never mind.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   Never mind.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.120]   They're going to open that up.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.720]   Two choices, that doesn't make much sense.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.600]   Well, it's like 140 characters.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.400]   But it's funny that people use favorite if you think this, a retweet if you think that.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.560]   The polls are obviously a much more intuitive way to give an answer, but it just surprised
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.840]   me that it was two.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.080]   It was only two choices.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.880]   But you know that these things that we're talking about, I'll go back to the big themes
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.360]   of openness versus control and simplicity versus choices.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.600]   And maybe more than one choice is just too much for people to handle.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   I don't know.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   I think two choices.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   I understand it's like 140 characters.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.160]   It's an arbitrary limit, but I think it makes it very easy to very quickly go, oh, yes,
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   no, yes, no, yes.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   Yeah, that one.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.840]   So I think that that isn't so bad.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.640]   I mean, I'm trying to create a platform that pollsters will use to choose between the Republican
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.920]   candidates.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.800]   You need like lots of ton of choices as nuanced as our TV coverage is.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.160]   Yeah, yes or no.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.520]   It's basically will Trump win?
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.320]   Yes or no?
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   All right.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:26.280]   I mean, it also seems like a great way to gather more data points about what your users
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.720]   like and don't like and see you can advertise them effectively.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.120]   Should I see this movie or that movie?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.480]   That's the kind of stuff it'll be used to.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   Exactly.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.400]   It's not the magic gate ball.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.600]   That's a yes or no.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:51.080]   Do not kick refugees is the moral of this story.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.320]   Did she kick them or just trip them?
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   I don't know.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.960]   Cause to fall.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   Cause to fall.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.480]   Why would she do that?
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.960]   Anyway, she's facing trial in December.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   She got fired.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   She got fired.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.760]   And now she's suing Facebook.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.560]   She's a Hungarian camera woman for N1 TV.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.680]   She's going to sue for facilitating an online campaign against her.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.600]   Facebook played a major role in my situation, she said, and helped embit her people against
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   me.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.080]   I was loving everybody else was happy, right?
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.360]   The Petra Lazlo shame wall currently has about 10,000 likes.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.440]   It's called that the shame.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.320]   So did she trip this person on purpose?
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.400]   No one really knows.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:45.120]   She claimed that Syrian refugee was tripped by Lazlo had changed his testimony.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.360]   One of the policemen tripped my son, but it wasn't as bad as the camera woman.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.920]   He told the Daily Mail after the incident.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   He fell into the ground.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   That's seven year old.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.240]   So his seven year old was tripped by policemen and then he was carrying him and then the
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.920]   camera woman trips him and he falls on her.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.440]   She says she's considering moving to Russia.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.960]   She has no future in Hungary, but one thing we know for sure, we will sue Facebook and
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.240]   we will also prove that the refugee was wrong.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   I don't know.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   There's video.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   I don't know.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   I'm trying to catch the trip here.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   It's hard to.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.560]   Well the angles bad.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.720]   Let's we'll watch it again.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.280]   Oh yeah, her leg.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.640]   See there she is on the right here.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.800]   Okay.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.640]   And here comes Osama.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   And whoops.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.120]   Are you kidding?
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.480]   Her leg goes, look at that.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.280]   But why would she do that?
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.760]   So she get a good shot of him falling.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   I don't know.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.480]   I don't know either.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   And she kicks.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.560]   Oh, she kicks somebody out.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.560]   Okay.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.560]   There you go.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.560]   She's just a jerk.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.360]   She did a karate kick.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   Oh my God.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.960]   She kicked a little girl.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   Oh my goodness.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   Okay.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.640]   Well, video, you know, you need to sue the guy who invented video cameras because that's
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.680]   really that's really who got you in trouble there.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.760]   We're to talk about YouTube red.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   I don't know what it means for me or anybody or but I'm sure our panel will figure it out.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.560]   A membership version of YouTube.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.640]   Matt cuts us here.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.300]   He's some guy.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.200]   You may remember him from the webmaster videos on YouTube.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:37.460]   I mean, Google's Webmaster Tools and he's currently enjoying life as a civilian.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.100]   We don't really know much more than that.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.200]   That cuts.com/blog if you want to read more.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.600]   I like the idea that not that one is Matt would be wearing a Google uniform.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   He's out of uniform right now.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   Right.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   Yes.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   Not wearing his beanie.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.240]   I imagine multi colored primary colored epilots.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.860]   Actually, I want to ask you about Omid Karmaswertistani actually, but we'll get to that too.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.780]   I'm sure you know him well.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.300]   And also that's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.980]   He's in London and he's about to fly to Mexico City.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.980]   But he's paused in his flight to join us.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.740]   I'll promise not to trip you.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.940]   Although it's tempting if you do run out of here, I might.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.940]   And Gina Trapani from Brooklyn.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.940]   Hello.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:28.680]   And the creator of not only ThinkUp, but now the new maker base, m-a-k-e-r-b-a.se.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.360]   And great to have you.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   Great to be here.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.360]   Great to have you.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.800]   Our show today brought to you by a very good thing to know about if you're one of
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   the people.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.240]   And I think you are who wants to learn, who wants to grow, who's curious, who likes to
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.880]   take classes to make things happen.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.480]   I'm talking about Linda.com.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:51.440]   Whether you want to develop an app, redesign your website, master, excel, learn a new programming
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.240]   language, or just get better at your hobby.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   I love photography.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.220]   I love Linda.com for photography, for Photoshop, for Lightroom.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.940]   It's the best place to learn.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.020]   Check out l-y-n-d-a.com.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.780]   They just added two great courses for beginners.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.820]   Lisa's taking the introduction to photography and getting started with photography.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.340]   These are taught by pro photographers.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:19.220]   In fact, people, the best of the business people I know, like Ben Long, there's been
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.020]   showing you how to get started with photography.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:27.900]   This guy's a great photographer, but also a great educator.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.660]   I mean, this is so cool.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.420]   There's also a five-day photo challenge, which I really love those challenges.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:41.860]   It'll help you improve your eye, plus new courses on color correction, making selective
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.020]   adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.300]   That's kind of a high-end topic.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.500]   Lightroom.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.300]   Creative Cloud essential training, the fundamentals of Photoshop.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   You start there, but man, they get deep.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   They get real deep.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.940]   When you're learning from people like, how do you use Photoshop from people like Bert
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.940]   Monroy?
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.620]   You're learning from the best.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.940]   I love Linda.com.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.900]   Over 3,000 on-demand courses, professionally shot.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:10.300]   There's transcripts you can read and search, so you can quickly jump to the part of the
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.980]   course that you want, or you can just watch it beginning and end.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.980]   That's the nice thing about Linda.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.660]   When you say you don't have to declare a major because with Linda.com, your membership gives
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.580]   you access to every video on the site.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.540]   You don't have to say, "Well, I want to do photography.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.540]   I don't know.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.540]   Maybe I'd want to do Excel.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.140]   Maybe I want to learn to be a programmer."
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.340]   No, you can do it all.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:35.940]   LYNDA.com, unlimited access with your membership to training on hundreds of topics, one low
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940]   flat rate.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:45.740]   To give you a taste, for right now, 10 days free when you go to Linda.com/twig.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.020]   Let's see what you're studying there.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:52.620]   AutoCAD, After Effects, a little bit of coding, a little bit of photography.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.820]   That's good.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.620]   Nice mix of stuff.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.780]   LYNDA.com/twig.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:06.140]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.340]   It's official if you go to youtube.com/red.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:17.460]   YouTubered is here $10 a month for a "amplified" video and music experience.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.020]   The amplification, there's no ads.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:27.180]   We've had this with the Google Music Pass with no ads in our music videos, but now it's
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.860]   for everything.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:34.820]   You can also save videos and songs on your mobile device to watch offline.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:41.300]   You can play in the background while using other apps.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.620]   Is this for every video on YouTube or does a company have to sign up for this?
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.620]   How does this work?
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.980]   TechCrunch says if you don't sign up, your video is going to hit.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.020]   It's like it's going to be for every video.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.020]   If I don't agree...
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:00.060]   Yeah, it's going to be every video except stuff like pay per view.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:07.900]   It's like 99% of the content and then the ones who haven't agreed, they'll have to work
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   that out.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.940]   It gets rid of all the ads, the pre-roll, mid-roll, banner ads, search ads, homepage,
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.740]   banner ads, in-video, text overlay ads, all that sort of stuff.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.500]   It doesn't take care of things like pay per view, pay channels or movie rentals, which
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.780]   is something that most people probably aren't doing.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.780]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:29.780]   So basically it's the YouTube you watch right now, but in an ad for experience.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:36.020]   So it's going to screw the hell out of us.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.900]   I guess we'll have to leave YouTube because I can't...
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.940]   I mean, we don't make an ad-free version of our shows.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.940]   All of our shows have ads.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:43.940]   I just did an ad.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.820]   That ad would be in our show and I would guess they won't let me do that because that
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.060]   wouldn't be an ad-free experience.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.940]   Do I get some of that 10 bucks?
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.940]   No, they do say that you...
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:03.460]   The artists do get compensated, as my understanding, and they do say on the site, you might see
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.100]   promotions or branding that the creator put in their video.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:13.420]   So they're not going to say you won't see a van sneaker that somebody put into something.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.060]   So it's possible that people who upload the video with something in the middle of it,
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.060]   that still would carry through.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:24.740]   But the moral hazard there is that rather than doing what Leo Dish did, which is a very clearly
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.900]   label commercial, you'll just be sneaking in.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.020]   Boy, Jarvis, you want to take a Linda course.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.820]   I'm going to fool him now.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.820]   I'm going to fool him.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.220]   You're an ignorant idiot.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.260]   And I think Linda might fix that in some areas.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.060]   And then that's not an ad, is it?
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.060]   It does.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.860]   It makes me want to do a native kind of...
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.900]   Of course, I would never do that.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.100]   So I'll just guess I'll wait and see, but it sounds like maybe all of our YouTube videos
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.900]   will be turned off as of October 20 years.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.780]   The only weird thing to me is if I were ad sales at YouTube, I'd be pretty upset because
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.180]   this basically says, "Yeah, yeah, okay, we know ads suck."
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:07.340]   This idea of the charge of the ad for experience devalues the other half of the business so
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.340]   much that...
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.180]   Oof, I'm not comfortable.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.340]   Yeah, you don't see...
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:18.140]   Even with Hulu, you don't see NBC doing an ad for experience, even with Hulu plus.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.580]   You get ads.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.380]   You don't want to imply that there's something wrong with ads except that we know...
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.780]   Come on, everybody knows there's something wrong with ads.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:33.180]   The question is, how they divvy up the 10 bucks a month, is it going to be...
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:39.020]   Is PewDiePie going to get more than somebody else because he has more people watch?
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.060]   I presume they'll tie it to the number of views.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:46.260]   I thought it was a minute's view, so creators who have longer videos and people who watch
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.420]   longer might get a better rate.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   Oh.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.060]   So we're going to start seeing longer videos?
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:59.620]   Well, I thought what I saw in one of the tech conferences was people who make shorts
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.540]   might make less if viewers don't stick around.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.660]   But I think the key is getting viewers to stick around.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.300]   Leo, didn't at some point...
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.700]   Didn't we talk about how you needed to take your ads out of your YouTube videos or some
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.700]   one?
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.700]   Well, we were talking about how...
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.500]   Probably the last time you were here.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:22.220]   And the email had gone out to YouTube partners with the terms of these terms that if you
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.660]   do not agree to these terms, then your videos will be hidden.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.660]   Okay.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.460]   And twice another part now?
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.460]   Could you put it on?
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.460]   I actually haven't...
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.460]   This is all new to me.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.260]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.660]   And here's the other question.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.140]   So the thing is, most of the people would watch just...
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:49.020]   Let's just say twig, for free with YouTube ads and your ads and whatever.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:53.300]   Are you allowed to put up two different versions of the same show?
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:58.420]   No, because I could only put up an ad-free version, right?
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.420]   Right.
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.980]   And then they run either run YouTube ads on them or...
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.980]   Now there's a bit of an antitrust issue there.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.900]   Because it says it's going to hide my videos not just from the ad supported, not from just
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.460]   with the ad-free tier, but from the ad-supported tier.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.340]   So if people are making...
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.500]   Are using this distribution panel and others to do things that have advertising embedded
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.620]   in them, and they're making their own money at that, and this is a mechanism to get people
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:35.020]   to not be able to do that, and only Google can make money through ads or something.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.020]   Yeah, this is...
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   It's the result of the impact on ads.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.620]   I mean, that's how I would interpret this, is the only people who can sell and run ads
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:47.180]   on YouTube is Google, period.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:58.460]   And if you want to be on YouTube, you best not have any ads that we didn't sell, right?
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.460]   I don't know.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.460]   Nobody...
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.460]   I don't know.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.460]   I don't know.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.460]   I don't know.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.100]   I'm a friendlier interpretation could be...
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.100]   Sure.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.100]   This is just a way for YouTube video...
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.980]   People who watch YouTube videos to not have to deal with YouTube ads, which involve the
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.420]   skip ad and the interruptions.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:21.740]   That whatever your content is, other than that, it is.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.740]   I don't know.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.780]   You were going to say something?
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.180]   So the only thing that I was going to say is just that I think you could still have things
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.940]   like pay-per-view and paid channels and things like that.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.140]   So I think that would provide a way to monetize.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:43.500]   But the other thing is if there are different avenues to monetize the content, then people
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.700]   could make money from the ads, but then the artist could also be compensated from this
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.700]   subscription.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:54.620]   And then that opens up ways where you can have more original content and more people
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.820]   who might be open to being compensated in different ways.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.620]   So I think that could be one nice thing.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.820]   The other angle that I haven't seen mentioned that much, which I don't think most people
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:09.580]   realize, is that this also goes pretty well with the Google Play music subscription.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.820]   So if you already subscribe to that, you'll get YouTube Red for free.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.820]   Oh.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.540]   And so if you're already paying your $10 a month so that you can stream all the music
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.340]   you want, then you won't see ads in YouTube.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.820]   Oh, that's great.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.500]   But likewise, if you sign up for the $10 a month YouTube Red, then you also get a free
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.100]   subscription to the Google Play music.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:34.460]   And so I think a lot of people hadn't realized that you would have paid $10 a month anyway
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.780]   to be able to get free music.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.740]   And now you can get free music and no ads in YouTube.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.740]   Wow, that's a terrific view.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.260]   You're in an ability to place that baloney on.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.260]   That's kind of among all the usage of YouTube.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.900]   I mean, you look at the kind of traffic PewDiePie has.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.500]   It's hard to imagine you make as much in the free version, but I don't know.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.060]   I'll see.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:06.220]   I'm sure they've been doing testing.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.460]   So would anyone here pay for that?
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.940]   I think I might pay for this.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.460]   Well, I already pay for Google music, so I guess I'll just keep that, right?
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   You're going to get it.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:21.700]   It's an interesting issue because it's my impression that a lot of people watch PewDiePie or 12
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.660]   year olds.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:30.100]   And I don't know if they'll have the $10 a month to pay for free PewDiePie.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:37.460]   So I think this what this does is it favors channels that and content addresses older
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.460]   users.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.060]   I'm sure YouTube has thought this through.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.460]   PewDiePie will continue to be ad support.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:51.220]   Everything PewDiePie is doing will continue because he'll say, "Yes, I agree to that."
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:56.380]   And if it's 90% of his users don't pay for it, they'll get the ads just like they always
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.380]   have.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.380]   I mean, I look at my 12 year old.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.100]   He's not going to pay $10 a month.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.460]   I'm not going to give him $10 a month to pay.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.180]   But I'll pay $10 a month so that my four year old isn't seeing commercial.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   You might.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.180]   I would definitely.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.940]   Because I don't want her to see commercials.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.180]   And you too mostly watches YouTube and the commercials are just annoying.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.300]   I mean, she sees commercials watching Sesame Street.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.780]   She's seeing ads for daycares and clean and household cleansers.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.780]   And she's four.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.780]   She's four.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   I don't want to see ads.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.780]   So I would say for that.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.820]   So I think there are probably scenarios with kids where you'd say, "Okay."
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.300]   Yeah, I'd pay for it.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   But I think Leo, you're right.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:37.100]   It's a story out this week because the PewDiePie makes $12 million in the last year.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:42.220]   And if that went down some good proportion because some good proportion of the audience
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:49.980]   doesn't want the ad versions and the net, well, or pick somebody else.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.980]   Pick, pick.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:44:01.300]   Well, it shouldn't because he'll presumably that the $10 a month for ad-free stuff will
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.300]   replace the revenue he's lost for that ad-free stuff.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.340]   What's the per user revenue level for each?
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.020]   Again, I've moved a no doubt.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.260]   I'm sure YouTube's figured it out, right?
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.260]   No.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.140]   But there's more than one agenda here.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.060]   One is revenue per revenue.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.660]   The other is hedge money on the advertising.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.380]   I don't know.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.700]   We'll see.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.860]   And as far as Twit goes, I mean, I'm just going to, I don't know.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.140]   I don't think we ever got the email.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.220]   So I don't know what to do.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.620]   And if we did, I guess we'll agree to it.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.340]   But we can't remove our ads.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.780]   We're not going to remove our ads.
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.220]   So it's kind of unclear in the FAQ.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:47.740]   It kind of implies that in in line promotions are allowed.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.900]   Are is something that's obviously an ad allowed?
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:50.900]   I don't know.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.340]   I actually don't know.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.980]   And of course, there's nobody, you know, I don't know what will happen.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:02.580]   So it is completely possible that one week from today, all of our content will disappear
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.580]   from YouTube.
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.580]   I don't know.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.940]   I'll be surprised by that, Leo.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.460]   I mean, I'd be really surprised by that.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.940]   No one's going to be like, I paid for YouTube red and I had to hear Leo like, really, he's
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:14.940]   commercial.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:15.940]   Like it's very, it's very clear.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.860]   The difference between YouTube ads and your ads are it seemed very clear.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.380]   And it's not like I would lose a lot of money.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.220]   We don't get a lot of views on YouTube anyway.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.300]   Most of our revenue does not come from YouTube.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.100]   Actually none of our revenue comes from YouTube, I think.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.100]   Very little.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:38.140]   So, hey Glenn, do we get an email from YouTube?
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.340]   I don't, I don't, I've never anyway.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.340]   I don't know.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.340]   So this is going to be interesting.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.540]   It is not an accident that Forbes had this article, by the way, this week on the World
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:52.220]   Ties Paid YouTube Stars because of course this is perfectly timed with this YouTube
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.580]   red announcement.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.500]   And the message is clear.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.380]   And I'm sure that these numbers are placed by YouTube.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.980]   The message is clearly look how rich you can get by being on YouTube.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.340]   And it's in the face of competition from Facebook and Twitter.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.380]   And supposedly Yahoo, although I don't know if that's real competition.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.980]   But it's amazing numbers.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.980]   12 million.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.900]   Wow, but it's a little confusing because it seems like they're not just, they're including
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:25.980]   revenue from books and makeup and other stuff, not just YouTube revenue.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.580]   So that's, yeah.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:33.060]   So $2 million a week before could be the YouTube revenue.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:44.220]   It's kind of, I mean, you should read this and tell me because it implies that, so for
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:49.540]   instance, number four, Lindsay Sterling, the dancing violinist who's used YouTube to a
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:54.660]   propeller to fame and $6 million in earnings over the 12 months to June, putting out two
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.100]   albums, a book deal and a lucrative touring career.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.700]   Is the $6 million coming only from YouTube?
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.100]   Or is that heard revenue, including albums and touring?
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.580]   It's not clear the way this is written.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.940]   Well, Michelle fan is obviously, but well, that's here.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.180]   But here's the other thing.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:20.540]   Michelle fan makes a lot more than $3 million from her business.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.100]   I don't know.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   I don't know either.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   It's not.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.340]   These are all cool, but YouTube stores.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.140]   I realize how old I truly am.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.340]   Yeah, they're all very young, aren't they?
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.900]   Well, and I just, I just don't know them.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.100]   Like, I just don't know them very well.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.980]   My neffi, PewDiePie is like my nephew's hero and I just don't, I don't really get, like
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.740]   I get that he like plays video games and curses out people.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.740]   I don't know.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.740]   That's my impression.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.740]   Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.180]   That's how I know I'm really old.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.700]   So maybe you had a point earlier about how older people pay for stuff because, you know,
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:52.420]   I watch Netflix and, you know, HBO go and all that, but not so much.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:59.660]   So here's the, maybe it is just revenue made in the YouTube videos, but it includes products,
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:07.700]   placement in the videos, I think, as well as ads sold by YouTube.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.700]   It's not clear.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.780]   It's a very unclearly.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:14.740]   I don't know.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:19.220]   But the point is not, the point is for somebody to read this and go, wow, I'm going to make
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.540]   a killing on YouTube.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   Yeah, right.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.580]   And I've always felt bad about that a little bit because I think there's so many people
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.700]   who get seduced.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.740]   It's like saying, hey, you could be a basketball player in the NBA and make as much money as
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.740]   Shaq.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.780]   And it's just about as likely.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.020]   Mm hmm.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.180]   Well, I'm not sure it goes that far.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.260]   I mean, there's also people who are saying, you know, make it, learn how to make an app
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:46.920]   and you'll make billions of, right, not dollars and it's like, well, some people do it.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   Some people don't.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.980]   And a lot of it depends on how much work you put into it, how creative you are, all that
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.980]   sort of stuff.
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:55.380]   So I think it's a long shot.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.540]   A really long shot.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:03.620]   But no, no, I mean, clearly YouTube wants to imply that it, but you could be the next
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.420]   one.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.060]   So I just could to know that you get this.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:12.580]   I will be getting it then because I'm a YouTube, I subscribe to music all access past.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.220]   They don't call it that anymore, whatever they call it, the Google music.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.220]   Just play music.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.220]   Play music.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.220]   I get some credit to play music.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.460]   I won't have ads on my YouTube anymore.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.460]   Is that right?
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.460]   That's right.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.020]   You'll also, if you're interested, yeah, there's a YouTube music app.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:31.780]   So it's not just the YouTube app, but a dedicated music app for YouTube that you'll be able
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.900]   to play around with as well.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.500]   And so you can like look for different versions of songs and stuff like that.
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.140]   So that's a pretty neat experience.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:43.380]   They've been incorporating that in, which is, I agree, is really awesome.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.580]   Anyway, watch for it.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.580]   Don't you think it's...
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.580]   Go ahead.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.700]   Leo, don't you think it's a little easier to become popular on YouTube than to get your
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   own TV show?
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.700]   Oh, definitely.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.700]   Really?
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.460]   Well, you may not make $12 billion, but could you make $100,000?
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.460]   Could you make $25,000?
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:09.420]   How many people do you think you're making a live-in on YouTube?
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.540]   More than there are NBA stars.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.100]   NBA stars maybe, but I don't know.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.580]   I think there are a lot of people make money living in TV.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:22.260]   I think it's about the same, frankly, because it comes down to the...
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.140]   What's missing is the gatekeeper, right?
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.580]   So there's nobody saying...
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:30.340]   But I think the gatekeeper isn't really the bottleneck because you still have to be popular,
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.340]   right?
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:37.740]   So assuming that the gatekeeper does a decent job of keeping the unpopular people out and
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.420]   isn't blocking somebody who's potentially really great, I mean, I guess.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.620]   I mean, PewDiePie would never get on network television.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.620]   That's obvious.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.260]   The gatekeeper and also the number of possible stars, right?
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.940]   There's only so many shows, so many hours.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:54.380]   There's a lot more stars on television than there are on YouTube.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.180]   Well, but this is a new medium.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.180]   Okay.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.500]   I think Matt's point is good.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.500]   I think...
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.500]   I don't know if it's...
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.820]   I don't know if I would say that's obvious.
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.780]   You could make a living blogging.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:10.220]   No, but it's the wrong analysis to say how many are there.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:14.500]   I think what Matt's saying is how hard or easy is it?
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   If you wanted to go yourself and if you do something that is popular, I disagree.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.500]   I disagree.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.380]   That's the big one is if you do something popular.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.140]   So it's not merely how hard you work.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.380]   It's how people take to you.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.940]   Talent, luck, and concept, and production.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.540]   I think that's similar in both media.
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.060]   Yeah, that happened very well.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.220]   The difference is the gatekeeper.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.220]   Yes.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:42.220]   But on the other hand, in more traditional forms of media, you have a lot more support.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.700]   And I know that's why YouTube built the YouTube studios and all that stuff.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.220]   But really, you're not going in on your own.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:52.940]   The difference is the gatekeeper, but the difference is also when you can access a worldwide
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.540]   audience, you can aggregate enough of these small folks who are kind of weird that you
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:02.940]   can find a niche that is like something that would never work in a small town or on network
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:09.540]   television, whether it's gadget bloggers or SEO people or whatever.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.220]   There's room now so that you can take all the Dungeons and Dragons fans or whatever,
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.180]   and you can make your own little channel.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.060]   Now, is that enough to live on and prosper and go big?
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.580]   I don't know, but at least that's an avenue that wasn't there before.
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.580]   Well, I wouldn't.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:28.740]   I absolutely wouldn't argue with the fact that you could find an audience.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.900]   I'm only saying whether you can make a living because we hear, I mean, I look at Pomplamoose
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.500]   as a really good example.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.900]   Jack and Natalie Don, I think, are very talented musicians.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.220]   They've done a lot of YouTube videos, many with Jack said himself.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.220]   When I had a million views on a video, I made $1,500.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.900]   It cost me $6,000 to make the video.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:50.020]   I realized this was not a model, and he started Patreon.
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.660]   I don't think that he's alone.
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.580]   Can you become popular in YouTube and build an audience?
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.600]   Absolutely, in a way that you cannot do in any other medium.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   Make a living?
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.620]   I think that's another matter entirely.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.900]   I don't think YouTube, and this is something that I kind of blame YouTube for.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:12.580]   I think YouTube, I guess my attitude is one of the things that I don't like about these
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:20.820]   articles is it feels to me a little bit like serfdom.
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:25.660]   I feel like it's a guy saying, "Yeah, come work on our farm.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.700]   You could be rich."
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.500]   In fact, what you're really doing is lining the pockets of YouTube and not really getting
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.820]   much of a chance to make any money for yourself in most cases.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:42.180]   When you highlight these 12 people who are making millions, you're really doing a disservice
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:49.100]   to young people who really want to make it in the business and are going to work their
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.820]   butts off and are going to learn several years down the road that that is not a way to make
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.820]   a living.
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.100]   They don't pay that much.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:05.220]   The RPMs are very, very low, and the rich get richer on YouTube.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.780]   There's one guy who's learned how to make a living, and that's the 23-year-old Google
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:12.380]   employee who's living in a truck and saving 90% of his income.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.980]   Did you see that story?
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.660]   If I were 23 years old, I'd be like, "Wow, maybe that's not as bad."
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.660]   "I do not know."
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.660]   "I do not know."
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.660]   "I do not know."
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.660]   "It sounds amazing."
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.420]   "The truck would have been kitted out a little nicer.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.500]   It was more Ikea energy or something."
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.900]   "Yeah, he's got a whole plot."
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:36.100]   "This is not the first story of somebody who works at Google living in the parking lot."
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.100]   "No."
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.620]   "Google's just the kind of place that people would just kind of shrug and be like, "Yeah,
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.620]   whatever."
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:44.380]   "Right, I mean."
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:52.020]   "We had this conversation about YouTube on Twit with Jason Calcinis, who of course wrote
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:56.460]   a scathing blog post in which he said, "YouTube's a great place to promote yourself.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.540]   It's a terrible place to build a business."
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:05.300]   I think that that's probably accurate.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.820]   I just worry about the young kids, because if you're a grown-up and you're making it,
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.260]   I mean, I know what I'm doing on YouTube and I don't expect to make money on YouTube.
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.980]   "Well, Leo, it's another way around, too.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:19.380]   I wrote a column of the Observer last week saying with instant articles and AMP and all
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.380]   that kind of stuff.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.860]   I'm saying immediate companies.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.860]   You get kids.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.380]   I'm saying to media companies that you should consider building a new media property, a new
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:29.140]   service to a community entirely on Facebook."
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.540]   "Well, I think that's what's going to happen."
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:35.660]   "I think one of the reasons this YouTube read is here is because Twitter, Facebook,
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.660]   and maybe Yahoo are all saying we want to build the next video platform.
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:47.340]   We are going to be, their come on is we're going to be more fair to the creators.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:51.420]   This is, I think, a lot of what's going on right now behind the scenes is Twitter's
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.620]   into this, Facebook's into this.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:58.980]   And remember this whole, we talked about it, this article by a YouTube creator who said,
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.900]   "Well, Facebook's got to stop lying if they're going to win people over."
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.900]   But that's the opportunity for these other companies to say to creators.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:13.540]   I mean, you've got to value the creators, obviously.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.540]   We'll move on.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.540]   That's fine.
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:24.900]   I think we covered all of the stories in that chunk there.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.700]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.580]   And if you're seeing this on YouTube after October 28th, good news.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.940]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.380]   It doesn't matter to me, but I think it does matter to the fate of YouTube a little bit.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:49.140]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.620]   What are these?
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.180]   What are your favorite part of freelancing?
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.500]   Formatting and sending invoices.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.620]   Collecting receipts and tracking expenses.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.380]   Following up with clients who don't pay you on time, now I'm going to just get into
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.020]   press or none of the above in any case ever once in a million years.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.820]   Well, obviously it's none of the above.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.420]   Because that's the part part.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.780]   Everything is great about being a freelancer.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.260]   You get to do what you love.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.340]   You get to work with great clients.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:23.660]   But man, billing for expenses and sending out invoices and following up is just the worst.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.780]   And so that's why FreshBooks is so important.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:30.940]   If you're a freelancer or small business, FreshBooks is a lifesaver.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:31.940]   It was for me.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:36.060]   It's a super simple cloud accounting program that's giving thousands of freelancers like
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.740]   you the tools to save time billing get paid faster.
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.740]   Let me be clear.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.980]   When I say program, it's a web.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.740]   It's completely web based.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:43.740]   So easy to use.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.580]   You'll make great looking professional invoices.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.620]   You'll get paid faster.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:53.420]   If people are slow to pay, the FreshBooks will automatically send out an extra email.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:59.380]   You'll be creating those invoices in minutes and sending them out, watching your expenses,
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:04.260]   organize themselves, use a FreshBooks app on your smartphone or tablet.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.900]   And boom, that expense goes right into the invoice.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.780]   Be tracking your time, your billing, your hours.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.620]   You're going to wonder why you're going to start doing this sooner.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.860]   You've heard me talk about it before.

[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.500]   I don't think you're going to.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   I never talked to them once.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.100]   FreshBooks just worked right out of the box.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.780]   I loved it.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.460]   I used it for years.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.740]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:41.540]   Don't forget to mention that you heard it on this week in Google in the How Did You Hear
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:42.540]   About Us section.

[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.980]   Really an amazing solution.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:54.020]   Big victory for the Google.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.100]   I think it's a victory.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:00.100]   I think we can say a lasting victory in the Google Book Project.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:05.380]   In this scan books, a Federal Appeals Court last Friday dismissed the lawsuit brought by
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:09.820]   the authors guild over the digital copying project.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.820]   This has been going on for a decade.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:18.180]   In 2005, the authors guild accused Google of massive copyright infringement in a federal
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.180]   lawsuit.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.660]   Google had started scanning in books.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:27.820]   They'd scanned in or they have scanned in 20 million books.
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:33.100]   And reached an agreement eventually with the publishers.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.940]   Actually, I think it was a court.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.340]   Wasn't it a court mandated agreement, Jeff?
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.740]   I think so.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.940]   It was back and forth so often.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.500]   I can't remember who was on first.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:48.300]   And then the publisher said, "Okay, but the authors guild said no freak in way."
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   They went back to court.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:53.700]   The second US Circuit Court of Appeals says it's not infringement.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.380]   They said this unanimously, by the way.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:59.860]   Because what the company makes viewable online is so limited.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.260]   This was affirming a lower court ruling against the authors guild.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.700]   Now I guess the authors guild go to the Supreme Court.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.940]   There's no comment yet from the authors guild.
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:15.740]   But this is a pretty strong, I would say, victory.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.620]   Now I understand the authors guild point of view.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:23.100]   They're afraid that Google's going to scan books in their entirety.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:29.020]   And then the authors will never sell books, but that's not whatever happened.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.820]   Google's using snippets, right?
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:40.940]   And also being able to analyze it so that you can find things that you otherwise couldn't
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:41.940]   find through search.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.740]   So it's not just what they display.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.740]   It's also that because they've scanned them, now these--
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.740]   That's so awesome.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.900]   --become more findable.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.420]   What is that called, what page is that, the insights page?
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.220]   It's got a funny name.
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.260]   I can't remember.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.620]   Where you type in two words and it bases it says how often.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   Oh, the Google trends?
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.620]   Trends?
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.620]   No.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.780]   No, no, this is the one where you--
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.620]   Oh, it's the 1890.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:14.460]   The word hack has been used like this.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.980]   It's the end-gram viewer.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.980]   End-grams.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]   End-gram viewer.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.860]   Thank you.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:20.860]   That is so awesome.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.860]   We've used it.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.860]   We've had fun with it.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.860]   Bookstock Google.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.180]   It's part of the Google books thing.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:28.180]   BookstockGoogle.com/ngramngram.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:38.260]   So for instance, between 1800 and 2000, Albert Einstein, Sherlock Holmes, and Frankenstein.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.660]   Oh, that's so great.
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.180]   The blue is Einstein.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.980]   The red is Sherlock Holmes.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.020]   Frankenstein's just taken off.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:53.500]   Ever since the horror decade of the '60s, '50s and '60s.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.580]   Who thought that up?
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.340]   That's weird.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:01.340]   Search lots of books says the button.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.180]   But yeah, so it's things like that that's hugely valuable to society that does not impinge
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.700]   on an author's trademark.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.300]   And a lot of the books in this, of course, are orphan works.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.180]   They're in copyright technically, but nobody cares about them.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:18.580]   And those orphan works are just lost to society without something like this.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:24.380]   So I think this is great.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.100]   Authors Guild has not yet responded.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.820]   I guess they could and probably will appeal.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:41.260]   Google now says they have 100 million MAUs in Google Photos, 100 million monthly active
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.260]   users.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.260]   Wow.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.580]   That's in five months.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.580]   No, it doesn't.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.580]   It's awesome.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580]   It's great.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.580]   I use it almost every single day.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.580]   It's great.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.780]   Top photographed locale.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:03:01.820]   Paris course, followed by New York.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:05.620]   You're all foodies.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.300]   Besides people, food is what you photograph the most.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:14.220]   And they know this because they categorize it automatically.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.420]   The events you photograph the most are weddings, followed by concerts, Christmas, dancing,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.420]   birthdays and clubs.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:25.780]   That's only been around for five months, so that may change, right?
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.420]   I mean, Halloween, right?
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.860]   People take more photos of dogs than any other animal.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.820]   That's them fighting words to cat fans.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.820]   I'm surprised.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.820]   I'm shocked.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:43.860]   You drove cars to the number two spot in the list of things photographed.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.860]   What?
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.340]   Why did I understand that one?
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.060]   You drove cars to the number two.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.540]   Oh, cars are number two of the things photographed.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.540]   Really?
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.140]   But what is number one?
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.140]   Oh, people?
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.140]   Food?
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.140]   Food?
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.140]   I don't know.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.820]   It's Paris, New York, Barcelona, the top photographed places.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.620]   Oh, that's just by sure.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.620]   Barcelona, who would they?
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:07.620]   I don't know.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.180]   Babies are the top photos subject you searched for.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.180]   Babies.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.180]   Yay.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.220]   And by the way, this page is great.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.700]   It's public and it's the official Google blog.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:24.840]   And the good thing is what it really is is giving you tips for, you know, search for
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:32.420]   pizza or try searching Halloween, pumpkins and costumes, try searching for breeds.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   It knows breeds?
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.420]   Wow.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.900]   Search for car types, trucks sedan convertible.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.140]   You can search for the Eiffel Tower.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.340]   It says, we'd recognize it anywhere.
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.540]   We'll add it to your places even without a geotag.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.540]   Mm-hmm.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:58.400]   You can have a private name label with your baby's nickname so you can find pictures fast
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.860]   without giving away their secret identity.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.020]   You created...
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.700]   Now I don't know if this is you or Google.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:09.980]   I would say this is Google has created more than 15 million animations and collages because
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.980]   you don't do anything.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.980]   It just does it for you.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.020]   The assistant does it for you.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.020]   You can...
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020]   But you can also do it now.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020]   Oh, okay.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.020]   So maybe people have created 15 million.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.020]   Start by selecting photos, tapping the plus button.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.020]   Okay.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.020]   That's like the enemy.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.020]   All right.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.020]   All right.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.020]   That's probably automatic though.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.020]   I don't know.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020]   I would agree.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.020]   I don't know.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.020]   I'm just gonna say that's just something in my library already.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   Just me.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020]   Just me personally.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.020]   Just me personally.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.020]   Just me personally.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:42.780]   Well, if you do a lot of burst mode, you know, you'll get a lot of animations.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:43.780]   I love that.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.780]   Yes.
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.140]   I love Google photos.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:50.260]   We've freed up 3,270 terabytes of storage.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:54.380]   So I think that's what they're saying is that's how much we're using.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.300]   Is that 3.7 petabytes?
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.100]   No.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.540]   What comes after terabyte petabyte, right?
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.540]   Okay.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:03.540]   Google.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.140]   No, you can't do that anymore.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.060]   I had this is the saddest thing in the world.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:14.580]   You can't say, okay, Google, do your browser on your desktop anymore.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.580]   That makes me cry.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.300]   I can because I have a Chromebook.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.860]   Oh, I still can too.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.860]   3.7 petabytes.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.860]   Petabytes.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.860]   Wow.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:25.860]   Yep.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:26.860]   Wow.
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.860]   That's a lot of petabytes.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.860]   Check it.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   Is it really?
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.860]   Do we know?
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.860]   With the total storage Google uses.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:34.860]   It's a lot.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:35.860]   It's a lot.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:36.860]   It's a lot.
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:37.860]   It's a lot.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.860]   Many.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:39.860]   Many.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.060]   One, two, three, many.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:45.340]   That's just the amount of storage that has been freed up on people's phones from backing
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.340]   up to the cloud.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.860]   So just think about it.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.860]   There's a lot.
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   It's amazing.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:54.140]   There's no word for the volume of storage Google has.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.140]   I would love to know.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.140]   It's just big.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.740]   There'd be some great people.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.180]   Well, Randall.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.180]   There is a TED Talk.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:04.380]   Randall Munro from XKCD did a TED Talk where he tried to estimate the amount of storage
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.140]   that Google has.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.580]   It's actually really amusing to watch him go through the process and then we know what
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:14.620]   the real answers are until we come here where he got it right or he got it wrong.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:20.140]   And I think they sent him some reply that was on a punch card or something like that
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.060]   that was like a nice try or something.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   I love it.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.940]   But that's a pretty good TED Talk to watch if you can find it.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.620]   So I can still do-- I could talk, but I have to click the mic.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.900]   It's no longer-- I can't just say, OK, Google to the-- that's fine.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.900]   I don't know why they get rid of it.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.140]   As they say, nobody used it.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.540]   I think it-- I think it's a tech--
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.740]   I use it on my phone all the time.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.180]   I don't use it on my computer.
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:45.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.180]   OK, Google.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:50.620]   Did you hear that?
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:56.900]   Sky beaches and mountains are in the top 10 things we take photos of.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.300]   And it's no surprise.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.260]   Search is for me are very popular.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.380]   I wish they'd say how popular.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.580]   Probably number one, right?
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.580]   Number one search.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.580]   Me.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.580]   That's a-- I love these--
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.220]   People don't realize.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.380]   They can search for me.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:17.620]   So it's one of those tips again where they're trying to let you know they can.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:18.780]   Yeah, that's so cool.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.180]   I'm doing it right now.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.180]   I am too.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:28.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.380]   I can't get to the search box.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.100]   This happens to me.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.340]   There we go.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.220]   What I will usually do is just click my face.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.020]   But what if I just search for me and let's see if it knows?
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.260]   No, it says it's confused.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:42.220]   By the way, my favorite picture of all time--
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.220]   Here we go.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   Aw.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.700]   Aw.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.580]   And Google made an animated GIF of that, actually.
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:55.780]   Which I have on my-- if you go to LeahVille.com, it's one of my front page photos.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.020]   That's interesting.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:01.140]   Me did not work with me.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.420]   Me gave me a very random.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.300]   You just have a poor self-image.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:11.100]   The time hop feature of Google Photos is really great.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.900]   Loving that.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:17.420]   It's so much better than-- I mean, I love time hop, the product time hop, and think
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.780]   up does a similar thing.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:22.900]   But what I love about the Google Photos one is that it's photos that I didn't necessarily
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:23.900]   share.
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:24.900]   So it's really comprehensive.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.900]   Right.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:26.900]   And there's always something.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.700]   They recover this day.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:34.340]   So this day in 2014, I love that.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.340]   Persimmons.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.340]   Persimmons.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   That's a good day.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.100]   Some reason took a picture of Persimmons and shaved in the studio.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.900]   Probably a Harry's commercial.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.260]   Yeah, I love the-- I love Google Photos.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.260]   That's just an amazing thing.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:53.820]   And with unlimited free storage, I just don't know why everybody doesn't use it.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:54.940]   So awesome.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.620]   Yeah, this day is-- yes, it's like time hop, isn't it?
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.260]   Which I love also.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:16.220]   We don't know what the monthly after-view users of Google+ are.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:21.100]   A year ago, when Rico'd asked David Bespers about it, he said, I don't want to talk about
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   numbers.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:27.340]   That's a good way to not answer the question.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.340]   OK.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:31.340]   If they wanted us to know, we would know.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.220]   We were talking about that yesterday on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.220]   Why?
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.580]   Because Tim Cook gave out some numbers about Apple Music and stuff.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.020]   Why give out any numbers at all?
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.780]   Why not just shut up?
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.340]   Cook won't say how many watches they've sold.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.740]   He said, because that's competitive information that our competitors could use.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.660]   I don't know how they would use it except to know whether to stay out of the business
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.660]   or not.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.660]   Save you in the end.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.260]   It's always a saving to me that the number isn't quite--
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.260]   Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.660]   Or you're saving the number up.
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.740]   Which is why you should say nothing ever.
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:09.500]   Because even when you don't say something, that's saying something.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.260]   Mm-hmm.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:12.260]   Google.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.260]   OK.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.260]   This is a good one.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.380]   Thank you from Burke McQuinn for this one.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:24.540]   Apparently, as you know, we were mentioning today is Back to the Future Day.
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:33.860]   And a tweet from the main Google account about 15 new Gmail themes actually has a link
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:37.820]   to a-- accidental link to a confidential PDF.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:44.540]   Do not share outside of Google.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.300]   Project Flux.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.980]   With Project Flux, our goal is to give everyone the ability to explore any place in any time,
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.580]   no matter where or when they are.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.500]   I love it.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:00.420]   Our mission to make the world's information universally accessible and useful.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.900]   But here's Chrono compression, time circuits, and power.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.660]   1.21 times 10 to the ninth watts.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.180]   Or 1.21 gigawatts.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:18.340]   And it will launch at the speed of 141.62 kilometers per hour, aka 88 miles an hour.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.340]   Mm.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.500]   This is so good.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.020]   Nice.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.220]   This is so Chrono compression device.
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:32.740]   Why that looks like a Flux Chronometer.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.420]   Early tests, locations.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.740]   Courthouse Square.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.580]   Flux Diner, South Pasadena, New Peapody Ranch.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.100]   Hill Valley, California.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:47.660]   Do you see the USA Today logo today?
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.740]   No.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:54.220]   Basically, in Back to the Future, there's an addition of USA Today.
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:54.700]   Right.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.820]   That's-- Cubs win the series.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.500]   So they actually change the logo to look like.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.740]   That one.
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:01.660]   That's funny.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:02.620]   That's a good touch.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.220]   That's funny.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:05.020]   Yeah, USA Today.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:05.860]   That's what featured.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.020]   Like, yeah.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.300]   Back in the '80s.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.500]   At this point, it doesn't unfortunately look like the Cubs are going to win this series.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.140]   I'm sorry to say.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.980]   That's so funny.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.140]   Special delivery, 15 new Gmail themes to make your inbox more awesome.
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.300]   And then if you click the link, what do you get?
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.620]   But what did come true was the sneakers.
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:25.580]   Self tying sneakers?
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.020]   We have those?
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.620]   Yes, we do.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.620]   It's on the run now.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.580]   Come on.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.740]   The last one on the run now.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.820]   All right.
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:40.420]   Um, I have a flux capacitor on my wrist.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.020]   Next Android Wear.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:45.020]   Nike is going to sell them next year.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:45.820]   Self-lacing--
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.540]   Yes, two haters.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.140]   --the first pair.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.740]   Michael J. Fox.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.660]   That's great.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.820]   That's not this.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.580]   [SIGHS]
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.020]   You know, I actually tried to watch back to the Future two last night.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.420]   God is that a terrible movie.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:08.540]   It's free right now on Amazon streaming all three of them.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.340]   It is the worst movie.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.100]   Hey, this is good.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:11.660]   I need this.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.980]   This fat men like me need this.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:13.540]   travel.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.420]   Sorry, Doc.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.060]   Nor have we figured out how to--
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.220]   And I like the vertical video, too, Nike.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.340]   Nicely done.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.180]   I think it's Michael J. Fox's.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.180]   Oh, did he shoot it?
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:32.020]   There's an animated GIF of them--
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:32.620]   Lacing up.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.620]   That's cool.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:40.620]   And the note there from the designer to him.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:41.620]   Oh, that's great.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.620]   Nike designer.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.620]   That's really cool.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.620]   How do they do it?
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.620]   There is the GIF.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.620]   That could be just--
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.620]   And does it work?
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.620]   I don't know.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:59.620]   It's pretty cool, though.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.620]   Next move on Google's part, a little competitive action here.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:10.980]   If you are a customer of Microsoft or IBM's apps subscription, you can get Google apps
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.620]   for free, as long as you're still under contract.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.620]   Hard to compete with free.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:24.620]   But you have to be paying-- you have to have an enterprise agreement with another provider.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.620]   And I don't know what happens.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.620]   I guess once that enterprise agreement expires, then you have to pay.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.620]   You start paying for your Google apps.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.620]   Well, and especially if you're looking to transition and you want to try things out,
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.620]   it seems like a pretty good idea.
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:38.620]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.620]   Try it out with no risk whatsoever.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.620]   And then if you've still got a one-year contract you can't get out of, that's fine.
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.620]   You know, just pick us up whenever you can, kind of thing.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.620]   We talked about this on Windows Weekly.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:52.620]   Yahoo is abandoning Bing.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:56.620]   They announced this at their quarterly results call.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:02.620]   They have reached a deal with Google for search.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.620]   This is-- yeah.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.620]   It actually was a regulatory file.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:08.620]   The future.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.620]   Back to the future.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:15.620]   Yahoo and Google have agreed to certain procedures with the antitrust division of the USDA,
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.620]   UJ.
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:23.620]   This, of course, because in the past Yahoo and Google's attempts to share a searching were
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.620]   investigated by the DOJ in 2008.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:31.620]   Actually, it was the ad deal, I think, that caused those problems.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:35.620]   So Yahoo, abandoned Bing.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:45.620]   Well, I think Bing is still supposed to be 51% or more.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.620]   Oh, just for the antitrust reasons.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.620]   Yahoo can use up to 49%.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:56.620]   Yeah, whatever deal they signed, you know, 10 years ago or something, Carol Bartz did at
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.620]   Yahoo, you know, it seems like they did a very strong contract back then.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.620]   Right.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:13.620]   Speaking of interesting Google stats, Google unveiled a shopping insights tool that gives
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:18.620]   us some interesting information about how people are using Google search and Google shopping
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.620]   and so forth.
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:25.620]   It's a part of a long-term effort to help retailers get deeper insights about users'
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.620]   intent and context.
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.620]   Is this where the number came from?
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:35.620]   Oh, no, this is where the number came from.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:41.620]   50% of people do zero searches per day on mobile.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.620]   What's wrong with you?
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.620]   You people.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:51.620]   So Leo, this goes back to where you say people should never give numbers because I remember
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:58.620]   for a long time Google said, for a long time Google said we have over 10,000 computers and
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:03.620]   we said that almost up into 2005 when we had many, many, many more than 10,000 computers.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:08.620]   Well, this person is doing the math, but they're using a number that we gave, you know, in
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:12.620]   2012 or something like that about how many searches a day or how many searches are a month.
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.620]   And so they just apply that directly and then they say, oh, there's this many active Android
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.620]   devices, do a little division and here's how many.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.620]   Oh, that's not real.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.620]   Google tends to say we do over this many searches and we don't update those numbers that often
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:27.620]   because they come back and bite you.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:32.620]   So the math 50 billion divided by 1.8 billion times 30 blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.620]   This is another was just a stupid article which I'm going to ignore.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:41.620]   Well, it was a smart idea to try to take, you know, brag it about active Android users versus
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:46.620]   number of searches, but it's limited by how much information, you know, has been made
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.620]   public.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:48.620]   Okay.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:58.620]   I just imagine those Google folks laughing at us again.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:08.620]   Google Maps now lets you add a stop along your route to check cash and went and checked.
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:13.620]   We also want to be able to say find the nearest Starbucks on the route.
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:14.620]   Ah, that's what I want.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.620]   Yes.
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:18.620]   I don't know if this does that exactly because it could be if there's one.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.620]   Yes.
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:21.620]   Two miles from you, but it's off the interstate.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:25.620]   So you're in navigation mode and you can search for Starbucks and then you can add them as a
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.620]   detour on the way to the final destination.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   Right.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.620]   Multiple stop.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.620]   Nice.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.620]   So it'll remember your final destination too.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.620]   So it doesn't break your initial intention.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.620]   And did we get the new ways app yet?
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.620]   Have you gotten that?
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:39.620]   I haven't.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.620]   No, and I'll buy it.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.620]   If I go on the lever, believers.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.620]   You're the ways guy.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   Apparently the big redesign for the ways app supposedly came out yesterday.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.620]   Let me see if I got the update.
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:54.620]   I don't think I did.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:55.620]   Speaking of updates.
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   Yes.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:01.620]   How long does it take to do an update of Android?
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:02.620]   Marshmallow.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:03.620]   We want marshmallow.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.620]   You're on an X6, right?
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.620]   I'm on an X6 too.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.620]   You still haven't gotten it.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:12.620]   Seriously.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.620]   Wow.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.620]   Why have you?
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.620]   Oh, that was a humble brag Jason.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.620]   Well, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:18.620]   I'm surprised.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:19.620]   No, no, no.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:20.620]   He installed it manually.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.620]   But I've gotten it over the air to most of my other devices.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.620]   You have?
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.620]   Oh, Jason, that was below you.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:28.620]   Sorry.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.620]   I didn't mean for it to sound that way.
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.620]   I'm just not authentically surprised.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.620]   Oh, you think the middle ages were in the 12th century?
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.620]   I didn't mean it as a humble brag.
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.620]   I was authentically surprised.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:42.620]   I thought for sure that 6 is it all gone.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.620]   What's wrong with you?
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:45.620]   Exactly.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.620]   I love all of you guys.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.620]   Okay.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:50.620]   Let's just get that out of the table right now.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:51.620]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:55.620]   Are you connected to the internet?
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.620]   This is an unlocked Google fine X6.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.620]   I don't know what it would be holding me back here.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:04.620]   But I pressed that update button all the time.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.620]   I am really grateful that they're doing monthly.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:10.620]   Yeah, your system's up to date.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.620]   Thanks.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:15.620]   I am really glad they're doing those monthly patches because that's very good.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.620]   But I got I got I saw so what it patched mine.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.620]   I got all happy.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:21.620]   I kept trying.
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:26.620]   I tried to do now on tap like five times for I realized it was 5.1.1.1.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:31.620]   It's the new monthly security upgrades, which is great.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.620]   But not.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.620]   But it does kind of set you up, doesn't it?
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:36.620]   You have to look at the size.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:38.620]   It's 12 megabytes.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.620]   That's a lot much more.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.620]   That's the patch.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:49.620]   Well, then I guess I can't, I can't tell if I've got the new ways or not.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.620]   It's much more colorful.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   The icons look better.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.620]   The maps are more colorful.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.620]   Yeah, I don't think I have this.
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:58.620]   But it's still kind of wazy.
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:00.620]   Which I want.
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.620]   I like ways.
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.620]   You want to stay you want to stay like ways.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.620]   I'm so used to it.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.620]   I like it better than Google Maps.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:12.620]   Well, it's the craps are really nice, but I'm so dependent upon it.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.620]   It is my the light at the end of my tunnel.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.620]   It is my north star.
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:26.620]   And what I hate is when I hate night mode on both of them.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:30.620]   You like the white maps and I have to search to try to find where they're.
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:36.620]   You probably don't use the satellite view either.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:41.620]   No, no, never.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:44.620]   Oh, it's I was I was only at the moment.
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.620]   It's I was only it's not for Android people now.
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.620]   Oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.620]   Now, it's ways 4.0.
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.620]   It'll be at Android soon.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.620]   Yeah, as soon as I get marshmallow.
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.620]   Yeah, it's on the iTunes store now, but Android later.
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:10.620]   By the way, that's the first time they've changed the absence they acquired ways all these years ago.
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:15.620]   They really left alone.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:20.620]   I talked to some ways people about trying to do something with them and they just emphasize again and again.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.620]   We're still a startup.
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.620]   We're not like Google.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.620]   We're a little startup.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:32.620]   Aren't they getting sued by somebody who claims that they stole some of their map information?
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:37.620]   I think that happened before it was before the Google.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:49.620]   Ways is being sued by Phantom Alerts filed in San Francisco federal court last month,
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:55.620]   saying that they used proprietary data from Phantom Alert without permissions.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:59.620]   Both apps share road, red light and traffic information.
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:06.620]   And the way they found out is the way map makers always find out ways was using the same fictitious location
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:18.620]   information that his company had used in Phantom Alert for just that reason.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.620]   We'll see what happens.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:24.620]   Suits, seats, monetary damages and an injunction against ways in Google.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.620]   I don't know where that stands.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:32.620]   That was a month ago and I haven't heard anything since.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.620]   I know you'll want to talk about this.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:42.620]   Jeff, you'll want to talk about the fact that the New York Times this Sunday will come with cardboard.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   Is it this Sunday or soon?
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:45.620]   I think it's not this Sunday.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:46.620]   It's not this Sunday.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.620]   November 7.
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.620]   Sorry.
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.620]   November 7.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.620]   Well, close enough.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.620]   Right.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.620]   I think this is wonderful and it's amazing.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.620]   I said so.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.620]   I have one copy editor like Quippels.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:02.620]   The news is not virtual.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.620]   Well, it's virtual reality means that it is a fake reality.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:07.620]   Right.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:14.620]   This is, I email the PR people at the Times to say, "Is this animated or is this immersive video?"
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.620]   It's immersive video.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.620]   So it's really a immersive photography.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:18.620]   There's immersive video.
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.620]   There's VR and there's AR.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.620]   They're all being lumped together as VR and maybe a losing bet.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.620]   People are saying, "I'll give up.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.620]   It's losing battle."
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.620]   But it's still early in the life of the technology.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.620]   When it comes to journalism, I think it matters.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:34.620]   Is this a made up animated scene or was this a scene that you shot according to journalistic
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:35.620]   standards?
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:36.620]   In which case, it's immersive video.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.620]   It's not VR.
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:43.020]   The New York Times magazine, it says, "Really release a new virtual reality film called
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.020]   The Displaced."
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:50.620]   But what you would say is a new 360 degree video or a new, uh...
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.620]   I just think so.
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:54.860]   Just to say once in the press release of this immersive video and then I understand that
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:58.860]   people are saying, "Well, Google is a VR headset and it's VR technology."
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.860]   Okay, I'll let that go.
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.860]   I'm not complaining about the times so much.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:03.860]   I got smashed.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:04.860]   People just give up to Arbus.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.860]   So I know I'm being angry with you.
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.860]   Virtual reality is the wrong phrase to use when you're talking about something that's...
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:16.860]   The other issue is when it comes to investment, VR to me is the last thing that's going to
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.860]   come because it's the hardest.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.860]   Immersive photography, immersive video.
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.860]   So, photography is really easy, you can do that now.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:24.860]   Immersive video with the jump and all that.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.860]   It comes next.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:31.860]   AR comes next in Ease, taking an image and augmenting it.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:36.860]   VR is really expensive and really hard and I think that...
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.860]   I agree, this is not VR, is it?
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.860]   It's immersive video.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:45.860]   VR implies what, that you can walk around in it, that you can experience virtual.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860]   It's made up.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860]   Right.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:52.860]   But even more than that, I understand you now because at first I thought you meant, oh,
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:56.860]   it's not made up, it's real, but it is also not VR in the sense that you can manipulate
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:57.860]   objects, you can move around in it.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.860]   You can only passively consume it.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.860]   The difference is you can look around, that's all.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:03.860]   It's immersive.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:08.860]   Which is cool and amazing and one of our professors at CUNY is starting to work on this.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.860]   And I think it's all great.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.860]   I'm not trying to nitpick to work at all, just the language.
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:14.860]   No, I think you're exactly right.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:16.860]   In fact, this misrepresents really what you're getting.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.860]   You're getting an immersive video of children being who are uprooted by war.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:27.860]   A million cardboard, more than a million cardboard VR viewers will arrive in the Sunday paper
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.860]   on November 7th, I'll get one, I'll bring it in.
[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   Of course, what they kind of neglect to mention is you have to have a compatible phone.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.860]   Which means I'm high-end.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   Well, but I'm high-end.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.860]   IOS or Android, but it has to be a high-end phone.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   It's not...
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.860]   Basically, anybody who...
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.860]   I mean, I can't see nothing my parents got to New York Times since they take its evil.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.860]   But I can't see, you know, people who have...
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.860]   What do your parents get?
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.860]   Grids?
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.860]   Yeah, your parents get your time's evil?
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:01.860]   (laughter)
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.860]   What do they get, Grids, and we're happy with it.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.860]   Oh, I got some Florida newspapers.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.860]   That's funny.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:08.860]   (laughter)
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:09.860]   And I thought...
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:10.860]   I thought my father thought...
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.860]   Action.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.860]   You always thought, "When you grow up, you're going to vote Republican."
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:16.860]   Well, you know, the irony of this is the...
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:22.860]   It's maybe Republicans that are starting to believe the New York Times and Democrats who think the New York Times is evil.
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.860]   They pretty much created the email gate issue, right?
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.860]   Eggs.
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.860]   Back to London.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:32.860]   And just for that one line, Leo, you're going to get about, "Oh, 4,000 emails in the nasty tweets."
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:33.860]   Oh, I don't care.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:35.860]   You shouldn't talk about politics.
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:37.860]   You shouldn't stick to what you know.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.860]   You shouldn't be talking about politics.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.860]   You shouldn't be talking about politics.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.860]   You know what people...
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:43.860]   Those of you who say it?
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:44.860]   Fine.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:45.860]   You know what?
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:51.860]   It always makes me laugh because what it comes down to is, I don't know anything about politics because I don't agree with them.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.860]   Exactly.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.860]   Price be nuts.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:57.860]   And anybody who knew anything would obviously agree with them.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.860]   So we now have a magic leak demo, and I am so excited.
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   And Matt cuts, "I know what division you should be working in when you go back to work."
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.860]   (laughter)
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.860]   Oh, that looks like fun, doesn't it?
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.860]   Oh, so Google owns this technology.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.860]   This is shot through the magic leap.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.860]   It says, "No special effects are compositing.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   We're using the creation of these videos."
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:25.860]   Magic Leap is an augmented reality system that lets you impose digital artifacts onto real life.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:32.860]   So we're in a real office, and there seems to be a spaceship floating under that desk.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:35.860]   Or maybe a solar system floating over the desk.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:39.860]   Over the ground, 20-some kind of moment.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:44.860]   But now I think it's a technology that Google invested in, but I don't think it's loaned.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:48.860]   I think they invested $500 million or something.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.860]   It's no important clarification.
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.860]   It's an independent company.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.860]   That's an impressive video.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.860]   Pretty cool.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:56.860]   Maybe I'm being dumb.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.860]   How are no special effects being used in this video?
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.860]   I don't understand what's going on.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.860]   Are they just overlaying?
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:06.860]   You're looking through their technology.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:11.860]   Actually, Magic Leap doesn't require a visor, right?
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.860]   I don't know.
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.860]   I don't know.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:17.860]   I'm going to check it out.
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.860]   I hope it's good.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:25.860]   I think Gina, when the alien was underneath the table, the table light could go in front of it.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.860]   And it had a sense of where it was.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:28.860]   That's the thing.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.860]   I don't know.
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:35.860]   Magic Leap is a computing platform, an augmented reality startup, where the real world is your screen.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:41.860]   Now, of course, what we've seen before with augmented reality is you have to be looking through a visor.
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:42.860]   Okay.
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.860]   Or so.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:44.860]   Oh, my God.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.860]   Look at this.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:46.860]   This is on the website.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:47.860]   Whoa.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.860]   So these people are not looking through a visor.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.860]   Those children we're looking straight at.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.860]   So is it a projection technology?
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:58.860]   I think it is.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.860]   I think it projects it into your eyes.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:03.860]   But there has to be something you wear or something to buy.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.860]   No, they're not wearing anything.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.860]   Look at it.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.860]   They are not wearing anything.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.860]   Yeah, but those could all be actors.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:15.860]   And maybe what you're supposed to be experiencing is what the camera is seeing.
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:16.860]   Is my guess.
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:21.860]   I'd still go to work for them if I were you.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:27.860]   So augmented reality is supposed to be harder than virtual reality because then you have to register it with the real world.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:28.860]   Right.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.860]   You have to know where stuff is.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.860]   The alien behind the table is hard.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:34.860]   In that case, you're right.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:38.860]   But you could also log into the real world with just data about that scene.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.860]   That is also a lot better.
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:45.860]   Just to know that these shots, which are obviously staged, but none of these shots are people wearing anything.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:46.860]   So.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.860]   So I used to do a.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:59.860]   I used to do a bunch of virtual reality stuff back in grad school and they would usually use the camera looking through the head mounted display or whatever.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.860]   So that's probably what's happening here.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:07.860]   But if it can register that well with the real world, that's pretty impressive cardboard.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:21.860]   The the the the the the the the the the the the cardboard does that where it puts stuff on that disc and it uses a special disc to make the background like a screen.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:25.860]   I want to know how you do it.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.860]   Really cool videos on the site.
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.860]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.860]   I think you should have a little elephant on your shoulder.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:35.860]   I would totally do that.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:37.860]   I would totally do that.
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:41.860]   You have the good elephant on one shoulder and the bad elephant on the other.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:43.860]   I want to know how this works.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:44.860]   Press it.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:45.860]   Yeah, we need really.
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.860]   I don't think these are actors.
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.860]   These these are kids who are are being surprised by whatever it is.
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:53.860]   This is.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.860]   No, it only works on video.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.860]   It doesn't work in the real.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.860]   No, look at these children.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.860]   What are they looking at?
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:01.860]   Really?
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:02.860]   Look at them.
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:03.860]   I see.
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:04.860]   Whoa.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.860]   Yeah, they all react.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:09.860]   I suspect someone is telling those kids to all act like a whale.
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:11.860]   You guys are so cynical.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   Pre-candy, pre-roll.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.860]   And I am such a gullible.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.860]   I'm so gullible.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:19.860]   Look at the kids on the other side.
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.860]   Or maybe they're actually sitting at Sea World and they just overlaid the basketball court.
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:23.860]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:26.860]   Maybe in fact there is a whale.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.860]   Yeah, Gina's got it.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.860]   Oh!
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:30.860]   Whoa!
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:34.860]   What are you talking about?
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:35.860]   What?
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.860]   What?
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:37.860]   I love you.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:42.860]   Never magically break like you.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.860]   Oh, I see you.
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.860]   Oh, hi, Dad.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:46.860]   Well played.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:47.860]   Well played.
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:48.860]   The illusion is broken.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.860]   The illusion is broken.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:54.860]   The illusion is broken.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:59.860]   You saved yourself $100 million instead of instead of...
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:01.860]   Who needs a magic leap?
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:02.860]   We've got to...
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:04.860]   I'm bored of this if you've got it to poop.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:05.860]   Jason.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.860]   I think it's...
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:08.860]   Mmm.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:12.860]   Listen, we don't need magic leap.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:14.860]   We've got Tricaster.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.860]   So...
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:16.860]   Oh!
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:21.860]   I feel that they are not using any technology.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:26.860]   I think this is just happening.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.860]   Okay, Google.
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.860]   What is magic leap?
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.860]   How does magic leap work?
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.860]   How does magic leap...
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.860]   Maybe they don't want you to know.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.860]   Apparently others have typed this in.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:40.860]   Here's a patent...
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:43.860]   Oh, the patent has a wearable display.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.860]   Mmm.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:49.860]   You never get a pony.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:53.860]   There's never a pony when you expect one.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.860]   Where are my eyeball implants?
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:35:00.860]   But yeah, I mean, I think it's important though that you mention that...
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.860]   How hard this is to do, Matt, because...
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.860]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.860]   You have to map the real world.
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.860]   You can...
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:06.860]   An immersive movie.
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:07.860]   And we can't interact with it.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:08.860]   Right.
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:10.860]   Oh, wait a minute though.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.860]   The work on glass is free three days, please.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:20.860]   And you've got to give props to HoloLens because if they basically took a connect and hooked
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:24.860]   it up to some glasses and then you get a 3D model that's good enough that you can do the
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:25.860]   occlusion and the registration.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.860]   And that's pretty impressive right there.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:31.860]   So props to Microsoft.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.860]   By the way, have you seen the video where people swap facial expressions?
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.860]   No.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.860]   Should we try it here?
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:48.860]   If you search for, I think it's SIGGRAPH, swap video expressions or something like that.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:49.860]   Okay.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:50.860]   So they basically...
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.860]   Yes, that's the video.
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.860]   Real-time expression transfer for facial reenactment.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.860]   Okay, so now what are you looking at?
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:04.860]   You're looking at two people that have video that are coming from two different connects.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:10.860]   And what's kind of strange is you look at the video on the left of the person and then you
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   look at what he's actually doing and he's not doing anything but moving back and forth.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:20.860]   But it's applying the facial expressions from the guy with the black shirt to the video
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:21.860]   on the left.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:22.860]   This is what I was observing.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.860]   And so you can...
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:25.860]   Yeah, virtual actors.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:30.860]   You're literally pacing expressions on top of someone else.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:34.860]   So I'm making them roll pretty realistic by mouth.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:37.860]   So the guy in that hoodie is just sitting there and doing nothing.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:40.860]   And she's making him a mode and talking.
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860]   Wow.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860]   Oh!
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:48.860]   And so it actually does a mesh and it recognizes where the faces are and then it'll warp that
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.860]   face to match the expression that it extracts from the other person.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.860]   So it's pretty good too.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.860]   And add teeth when teeth aren't there.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.860]   Wow.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:56.860]   Which is interesting.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:57.860]   That's right.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:58.860]   That's right.
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:00.860]   And so at first you're like, "What is...no big deal?"
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:03.860]   And then you realize what's happening and you're like, "Oh, this is crazy."
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:04.860]   Oh, that's crazy.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.860]   Eyes going, wow.
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.860]   That's what I need.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:10.860]   Welcome to the future.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:16.860]   We're going to be in a very weird world in about five years.
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:23.360]   There is nothing that's going to happen that anything...you won't know when you see something
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.860]   if it's real or not.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.860]   Yep.
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:27.860]   That's right.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.860]   That's exactly right.
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:30.860]   Oh man.
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:33.860]   Who's to say what's real is real?
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.860]   Oh boy.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.860]   Oh dude.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:41.860]   Oh dude.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:44.860]   Just think that you could do a completely scripted episode of Twig.
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:48.860]   You just scan our faces, feed us our lines and we'll just, you know, just let the...
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:49.860]   You could just...
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:50.860]   Yeah, relax.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:51.860]   We'll go out and get for a drink.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.860]   Get a drink.
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860]   I'm much easier.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:55.860]   I'd like you to have your all say "Lice to the Shoots' Rat."
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:00.180]   Hey, how was the...so you weren't here last week, Jeff, because you were interviewing Neil
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.180]   to grass Tyson.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:02.860]   How did that go?
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.860]   Was that fun?
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.860]   It was great.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860]   It was great.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.940]   I hate being away and I started the whole session saying that this is so good, it means I'm
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.860]   away from my beloved Twig podcast.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:21.860]   But we gave deal the innovation award and then he and I had an hour-long discussion.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.860]   The last minutes with the room but it was just amazing.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:28.860]   He's such a showman, he's just amazing.
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:32.500]   And the video, still on the video is him getting me about something.
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.500]   It looks like he leapt to his feet.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.340]   I mean, like was he up in a...we'll walk in a room?
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.340]   No, no, he wasn't.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.340]   I went around the room with the microphone.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.780]   But, you know, he talked about journalism, what's wrong with journalism, what's wrong
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:47.540]   with journalists doing things.
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:54.460]   And he's just so...the whole video is about online folks and he's just amazing.
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:55.460]   He's just a showman.
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:39:01.300]   And the poor guy afterwards, we have reception and then a dinner and he couldn't move a foot
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.740]   an hour because of all the people coming around.
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:08.980]   Obviously, he wanted his selfies but also wanting to argue about God and the universe.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:12.700]   And he just never turns it off in his generosity with people.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:18.700]   And his view is that if people are coming after him, that's because he says it's not
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:19.700]   me, it's science.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.700]   Yes.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.700]   They're excited about science.
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:22.700]   And that's what I like.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:23.700]   That's what I'm trying to do.
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.700]   Good for him.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.700]   And exhausting though.
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:27.700]   Wow.
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:28.700]   That's awesome.
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:31.500]   That was a real honor.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:32.500]   Good.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.500]   Well, we got to watch that.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.220]   Everybody got to watch it.
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.860]   I always, you know, we see stories in the paper and I always want to ask Jeff about it.
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:48.140]   Like this Amazon response to the New York Times and then the New York Times executive
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:54.140]   editor's response to Amazon and that Amazon in turn responds to him.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:57.260]   So I mean, I'm glad they're having a dialogue, but uh...
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:02.460]   Such a weird world where Amazon and the New York Times are arguing on medium.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.220]   Like, how did this happen?
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:08.340]   Like, when does the New York Times start publishing on medium in Amazon?
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.340]   It was so crazy.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.340]   I was joking around with Kevin Purdio saying, you know, the real winner here was clearly
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.340]   medium.
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.340]   Yeah.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.340]   That's true.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:23.620]   So, uh, I guess the Amazon said that one of the, uh, named sources in the New York Times
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:28.580]   article, remember the article and then New York Times would say, said everybody was crying
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:33.380]   at their desk into Amazon and it was a horrible corporate culture.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.780]   And of course, Jeff Bezos denied it.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:41.460]   And now, uh, this story from, uh, Jay Carney, uh, saying that what the New York Times didn't
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:46.660]   tell you is that one of the name sources was fired from Amazon after, uh, attempting
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:49.340]   to defraud vendors and concealing it.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:53.460]   Which does tend to throw that ex-employee under the bus pretty severely.
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:54.460 --> 01:41:00.980]   And then, and at the time, Ted, really, uh, given the Amazon folks a chance to respond.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:02.780]   They didn't check with that.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:03.780]   This way is funny.
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:05.340]   It's actually something Neil, Neil Tyson brought up.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:09.700]   He said, you know, I got interviewed by a big magazine and they got it wrong.
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.460]   And why didn't they show me what they wrote?
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.380]   Well, and our answer in journalism is because that's that, well, that would enable prior
[01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:17.380]   restraint.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.380]   We don't do that.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:19.380]   Right.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:21.740]   But then, you know, well, do you care about the facts?
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:26.340]   And so, so Carney, uh, you know, a former White House spokesperson, Carney's complained about
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:30.580]   Amazon here about the New York Times here is that, that, you know, we made people available.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.140]   You could have come to us and asked what about this source?
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.140]   Is this source credible?
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:36.820]   And we would have told you that something was, was rotten Denmark.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:38.660]   Uh, but you didn't do that.
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:41.060]   And then the Times responds, this is what we talked to a hundred people.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.780]   So it all averages out of, you know, if this, if this one egg is bad, we still have the
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:46.180]   right story.
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.460]   And knows as Amazon, you're still, you're relying on, on, on, on people's structures
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:55.060]   to make conclusions that you, you know, you shouldn't be, be doing.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.500]   Um, and there is kind of a scientific model question there is how many, how many anecdotes
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.780]   does it take to come up with the truth?
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.940]   Um, so, you know, when the, when the Times story came out, I was critical of it because
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:08.060]   I thought that it was a bit overblown for what it was.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.380]   And I also think, you know, I haven't written this.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.580]   I'm curious what you think about this.
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:18.820]   I haven't written this, but I think that becoming primarily dependent on consumer revenue leads
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:22.180]   to the desire to show off for your consumers.
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:26.060]   Now in a tabloid that's called sensationalism, I'm not accusing the Times of that, but the
[01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:28.220]   Times strikes me as been trying to do more.
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:29.220]   Wow.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.460]   You look what you're getting for your money kind of stuff lately.
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.180]   We went after Hillary Clinton.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.940]   We went after Amazon, aren't we big?
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:44.780]   And I, in both cases, I think there are standards of, of, of what counted for the full story.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:49.980]   They'll hold up as well as they would like to think.
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:51.660]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:52.660]   Interesting.
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:55.140]   Trouble in paradise for Tesla.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:43:01.220]   First Consumer Reports yanks their recommendation saying in our annual survey of car owners,
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:06.260]   a lot of Tesla owners were complaining of defects and problems with their vehicles.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:11.260]   Uniformly Tesla owners said that service was great, but there were problems, especially
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.980]   with early Teslas.
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:13.980]   Not surprising.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:14.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.460]   I mean, so it's, because the reports went from the best car ever made to your recommended.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.460]   A little binary.
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:28.060]   But the other thing is, I, in the one hand, I'm just so friggin amazed that, that quiet
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:32.380]   to the whole world must came up with a self-driving car and put it out in the market.
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:39.100]   On the other hand, it does seem to be taking exits not, they're talking about the road
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:49.100]   not taken. This is a video of the autonomous Tesla driving down the road and without instruction,
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:50.100]   taking a highway exit.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:55.900]   The ACC that's on over there and these auto steer, it's on blue. That means it's on autopilot.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:59.940]   When I turn it off, it turns gray or disappears.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:04.100]   So I just want to see the cars coming to my left.
[01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.780]   You got to be brave to do this.
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:06.780]   I got to.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:09.900]   I want this driver to concentrate on the video.
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.900]   Play attention.
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:13.900]   You're on the highway here.
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.500]   That looks like Jersey.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:20.060]   He's going 64 miles an hour.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:21.500]   He's, he's trucking down the highway.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.620]   He's in the left end lane, but.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.060]   Oh, he's not.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:27.780]   Is it the right hand?
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:28.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:29.780]   Right hand.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.780]   Left, right.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:31.780]   Yes, right hand.
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:32.780]   He's in the slow lane.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:33.780]   See what it does.
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:36.220]   Should slow down a little bit.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:41.780]   The weird thing is that apparently several people have reported this happening or it's,
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.140]   it goes into the turn lanes.
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.180]   Yeah, it goes off the road.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.580]   At least it's following a road.
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:54.220]   Sounds like it's taking exits, but that's a, that's very strange behavior and a little
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:55.220]   discombobulating.
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:56.220]   Well, remember.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:03.180]   In the discussion we've had on the show is that if a cell, a full self driving car causes
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:08.940]   an accident, presumption is that the software maker is the one liable.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:14.100]   Now, in this case, if you allow your car to be driven by Elon Musk and it doesn't want
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.340]   to take that exit.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.900]   He just took an exit.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.460]   Elon knows better.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:23.060]   He knows this is the road not taken that you should take.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:29.420]   Well, and Google's philosophy from watching people actually use self driving cars has
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:34.500]   been that they rapidly start to assume the cars got everything covered and they'll start
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:38.700]   eating and applying cosmetics and stuff.
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:43.260]   And so I think that changed Google's philosophy where they started to say get off the highway
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:47.500]   and start thinking about how do you drive on city streets and handle every different
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.500]   set of circumstances.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.500]   Right.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.940]   So I hope that people don't assume, oh, the Tesla's got it.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.780]   I can just sort of zone out.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:59.700]   And then next thing you know, you're down to exit ramp and heading somewhere new on an
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:00.700]   adventure.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:03.540]   So we'll see.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:06.820]   What is this?
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.020]   You might ask.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:12.220]   And I see a problem already with the name.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:14.740]   This is out of beta.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:18.140]   This is a home for people who love our entertainment journalism on the web.
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:22.700]   Every member can share one link a day.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.420]   Are you using this?
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:27.420]   I did for a few days.
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:28.420]   I used it.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.660]   Nice people who started it.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:33.700]   It's just one of those things that I just, you get in the habit of it or not.
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:37.300]   That's the problem is there's too many new things.
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.260]   I don't need so many new things.
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.260]   There's too many things to recommend to me.
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:42.900]   I already have too much to read.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.660]   I don't need more.
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:48.460]   No, no, no, I think it's a little more interesting.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:52.140]   I love those things that that my friends recommend.
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:55.620]   I think Nuzle, Jonathan's done a great job with it.
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:47:00.780]   The thing about Nuzle is I'm so active socially that a lot of what Nuzle tells me I've already
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.060]   seen because I'm active socially.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:07.060]   So it needs to put some more weird filters on it to give you a few surprises, but it's
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:09.660]   still very well done.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:10.660]   I got an idea.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:12.180]   Why don't we create a new video network?
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:21.660]   We could call it GBS that is branded content in time for advertisers.
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:25.940]   This is from CNN.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.140]   Is this all ads all the time?
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.340]   No, no, no, no, no, it's not.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:33.100]   But they sent me the press release.
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.420]   May I do a dramatic reading?
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:35.420]   Yes.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.380]   Go ahead.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.340]   What is great big story?
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:43.460]   Great big story is a socially distributed video network that covers real stories.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:46.420]   Great big ones, but it's not a news network.
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:51.540]   Great big story seeks out awesome, untold and inspirational stories about new front
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:55.720]   tiers, the human condition planet Earth tastes and flavors.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:58.540]   I just want to puke tastes and flavors.
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:47:59.540]   Face and flavor.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.900]   Solar queen quality with mobile in mind.
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:07.180]   Our stories will intrigue and excite everywhere you watch video from Facebook and YouTube,
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.820]   Apple News, to Roku and on TV.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:10.820]   It doesn't have a website.
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:11.820]   It doesn't have a website.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:12.900]   It's a shouty list.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.020]   It's time to feed your feed with great big stories.
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:19.980]   So this is like vice and buzzfeed where they don't have a home.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:22.300]   They want to think, but it's so dorky.
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.540]   How many great big stories will you tell?
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:26.900]   Infinity times infinity.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:27.900]   Wow.
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:30.300]   There's an endless supply of great big story.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:33.700]   I'm pretty sure it will not be infinity times infinity, but okay.
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:36.340]   I'm really sure that's not going to happen.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:38.460]   I really appreciate this style guide of this place.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.460]   The style guide has got to be amazing for this place.
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:45.300]   So wait, when you say that they don't have a home, that means that they don't have their
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:46.300]   own side.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:48.940]   They do have a home page, but they want to be social, which is the right way to go with
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:51.260]   distribution these days, I think.
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:54.980]   To a quadcast today, a buzzfeed executive was there.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:49:00.460]   And I asked at one point, I said, you know, with programmatic advertising, retargeting
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:05.020]   what's so important is the data point about the user used to be that advertisers would
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.380]   come because they want an environment.
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.100]   And the buzzfeed guy said environment is basically dead.
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:11.260]   Forget about it.
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:17.740]   And that means the website as an asset, the publication as an asset is greatly devalued.
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:22.620]   So what CNN is trying to do, which I applaud is to come up with a way to do the no network
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:25.700]   network, the distributed video that goes everywhere, to finally figure it out how to
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.340]   take advantage of that.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:30.540]   But Jesus, they're trying to be for millennials.
[01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:33.180]   I think you can just see the boardroom meeting.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:34.980]   I think the kids will like that, don't you?
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:37.620]   Yeah, yeah, those kids go for that kind of stuff.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.620]   Let's give more of that.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:42.180]   That's what the kids like.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:46.780]   Tim Cook said, he was trying to explain to a nephew what a channel was.
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.060]   And he says, why does anything even have a channel?
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:52.580]   What does it mean even to be a channel anymore?
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.300]   Channel nine, channel four, TBS, CBS.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.860]   What does that even mean?
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:57.860]   And I guess that's true.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:58.860]   And this is kind of.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:49:59.860]   Ish, yep.
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.100]   Aren't mobile apps channels?
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:09.900]   Like native mobile apps are still these like segmented like places that you go to get content
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.300]   though, you know, like this is, this is the weird thing.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:16.660]   I think that the ideas you go to Facebook and you get a variety of content.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:20.300]   Yeah, BuzzFeed says, BuzzFeed says, we don't care if you ever come to BuzzFeed.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.860]   We're going to be, we're going to encounter you and you're going to encounter us.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.020]   We're every Twitter and Facebook and stuff like that.
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:31.940]   The other thing that I think through with BuzzFeed, this guy named Dick B said that was
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.700]   I think really, really right.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.740]   We talked about VidCon when I was at VidCon, how video becomes social tokens.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:42.900]   And I share something with you, it says something about me and you and our relationship.
[01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:43.900]   That's what BuzzFeed enables.
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.900]   Right.
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:45.900]   So the sharing is insane.
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:48.180]   You should read this list of 27 cats.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:54.500]   The sharing is, is, is, is BuzzFeed enabling and feeding and fueling the conversation.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.500]   That's what BuzzFeed is about.
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:59.500]   That's what things like the CNN venture don't figure out.
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:02.940]   We'll have great stories because you must like stories because that's what we do is
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:03.940]   stories.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.900]   So we'll give you more stories but just cooler and stupider and shorter because we think
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.300]   you're cool and stupid and short.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.700]   Probably right.
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:16.180]   I, unlike BuzzFeed that when you share the list of 27 cats, what you're actually saying
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.900]   is I salute your cat love.
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:18.900]   Yes.
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:19.900]   I salute.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:20.900]   I like those numbers.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:21.900]   Yes.
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:25.180]   And by the way, odd numbers do better than even numbers, he said.
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.180]   What?
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.180]   Odd numbers.
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.180]   Ooh.
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.820]   Do because I said he said 26 cats.
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:30.820]   I said, isn't it usually 27?
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.820]   And we said, well, sometimes it's 28, but odd does does very well.
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:37.820]   Oh, they're, they're overthinking it.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.420]   I knew I got something wrong at life.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:41.060]   I always did a top 10.
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:43.900]   It should be a top 11.
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:48.820]   It's going to be like, you're lucky to be able to get a top nine.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.140]   All right.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:52.580]   Let's ring my chimes here.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.380]   I got the ring video doorbell.
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:55.460]   Our sponsor today.
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.460]   I love this.
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:52:01.740]   I installed it myself on our home and I just think this is so cool.
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:04.900]   I think of it as kind of like caller ID for your house.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:05.900]   You'll be able to install it.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.500]   I'm not a handyman.
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.060]   But they give you everything you need.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:16.060]   The doorbell itself right here, which has built in HD video camera plus a microphone
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:18.500]   and a speaker.
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.020]   So you put this in, you take, I just unscrewed my old doorbell.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.180]   I had two wires coming out of the door jam.
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:26.300]   Matter of this plate there, put the wires on the plate.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:27.300]   It's very simple.
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.300]   Anybody could do this.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:34.140]   It comes with a level, the appropriate screwdrivers and drill bits and all everything you need.
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:38.180]   By the way, this is a battery powered doorbell as well.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:43.020]   So you don't have to have those two wires if you do all the all the better, but you can
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:46.060]   charge it up once a year and it'll work on any surface.
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:49.340]   Now, if it's a wired doorbell, it's going to ring your doorbell at home.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:54.580]   But what it's also going to do is attach to your Wi-Fi and then ring your doorbell wherever
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:55.580]   you are.
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:59.860]   In fact, not just ring your doorbell, it actually has motion detection too.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.460]   So when my doorbell rings, I can answer the doorbell.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:06.460]   I could say, "Hi, I'm not here right now.
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:09.300]   Could you leave the box or if you're worried that it's a bad guy?"
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:14.060]   This is actually my front door and it's actually the cleaning lady got just got there.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.060]   So she's going to go in.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:19.740]   But that's good because I know now when I see the doorbell ring or somebody moving outside,
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:23.180]   I know who it is and I can talk to them even if I want.
[01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:27.940]   One of the advantages of this is burglaries tend to occur during the daytime, about 95%
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:29.780]   of them while you're at work.
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:33.660]   And in almost every case, the bad guy rings the doorbell first to make sure you're not
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:34.660]   home.
[01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:37.100]   Well, even if you're at work, you can say, "Hey, yeah, I'm here.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.100]   What is it?
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:40.060]   Oh, I'm in the shower right now.
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:41.780]   I'll be right out."
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.540]   And they're going to leave.
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:44.620]   They're going to go away.
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:47.860]   And if they don't, you also have video of them anyway.
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:56.340]   In fact, people have an LA.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:58.660]   There's Lisa picking up her mail here.
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:00.660]   Giant box coming in the door.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:01.660]   I love it.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:03.540]   I could tell when my daughter gets home late at night.
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:05.140]   I can see who's at my door.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.180]   I can even see who's in the vicinity.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.580]   And it's so easy to install.
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:09.980]   You're going to love it.

[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:36.140]   So if you don't have a wired doorbell, you plug in the ring chime into your plug socket
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:40.860]   and boom, it'll automatically ring.
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:42.300]   And you'll know somebody's at your door.

[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:34.220]   I'm here.
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:35.220]   Matt's here.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:38.980]   I guess we could do, we could go back to the old ways and do a tip of the week if you
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:39.980]   have one, Gina.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:45.100]   I actually, I have this really cool site that I found through Makerbase.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:48.460]   It's called, it's actually, it's kind of an art project, but you just, you got to look
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.460]   at this.
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:50.460]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:51.460]   Cameron's World.net.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:52.460]   Cameron's World.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:58.900]   This, this design, our name Cameron Askin pulled up a bunch of GeoCities pages, archived
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:06.340]   GeoCities pages and designed this amazing homage to like an earlier time on the web with,
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:12.700]   I mean, amazing imagery and sounds and just, you just, you just scroll through it and
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.700]   it's just a whole other era on the web.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:18.980]   I don't know if you can get audio on that, but.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:22.940]   Some of the things I prefer for you to see next, inflammation.
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:25.220]   And just just scroll, just keep scrolling.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:27.020]   It's just many flaws.
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:29.900]   It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's those were the days.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:30.900]   Yep.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:31.900]   Yep.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:32.900]   Oh my goodness.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:35.900]   And I mean, he, he designed these sections with all the, all the things that I've done
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:36.900]   all these different.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:37.900]   Hello.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:39.620]   Really is an amazing piece of art.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.620]   Let me tell you about my hobbies.
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:45.060]   I like to play chess and chat with ladies on the internet.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:47.020]   Hello, ladies.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.020]   Wow.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.860]   I mean, these are all from real websites.
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:52.860]   Yes.
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:53.860]   Yes.
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:57:02.180]   He excavated the buried neighborhoods of archived GeoCities pages from 1994 to 2009 and put together
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:03.900]   this just amazing experience.
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:10.460]   And I mean, if you have time, click around, try different things, play different clips.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.980]   It's incredible and so deep and just beautiful.
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:14.980]   Wow.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:19.340]   He's drooling in an asylum somewhere now after making a cheese that we're doing.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.700]   I mean, some of these are amazing.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:29.860]   Who does this is how it used to be, but nothing, none of the pages were as well put together
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.860]   as this.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:36.020]   Inside the browser is that mosaic catscape navigator.
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:40.100]   It says, what TV show do you watch?
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:45.380]   The same who'd know that who'd who'd think that they were still on?
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:46.380]   Get out.
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:47.380]   I warned you.
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:49.380]   This is so funny.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:54.820]   I bet it is deep because I bet you there's a, you know, you click these links.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:56.820]   Upgrades.
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.860]   Cascape is the most advanced browser available.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:05.100]   Welcome to shadows page.
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:06.100]   Wow.
[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:08.580]   The first kitty.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.580]   Wow.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:15.580]   Anyway, I just, I know this is kind of wacky, but I killed some time.
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:18.780]   Have you say, have you, you know, there's still pages like this?
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:20.620]   Have you ever been to Ling's cars?
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:22.020]   No, I have it.
[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:23.900]   Look at the under construction section.
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:24.900]   That's amazing.
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:33.180]   Modern web page by Chinese woman in England who, who is selling cars.
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:34.980]   I've been trying to get her on triangulation.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:42.060]   She says, I'm very busy right now, but this is the funniest and this is, this is real.
[01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:43.060]   This is current.
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.060]   This is her business.
[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:45.900]   I like the retro aesthetic when it's done.
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:46.900]   I love it.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:47.900]   Well, yes.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:50.140]   And she knows what she's doing.
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.140]   It's tongue and cheek.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.700]   She says, there's a lecture by her online.
[01:58:53.700 --> 01:59:00.380]   And says, it's all crap JavaScript.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:06.060]   It's quite, this reminds me of Cameron's world a little bit, except it's, it's real.
[01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:07.060]   It's real.
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:08.420]   This is real, folks.
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:15.140]   This is modern.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:17.420]   I'm really trying to get her on the triangulation.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:18.420]   I don't know.
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:19.420]   I don't know what it would be like.
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:20.900]   That'd be amazing.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:23.660]   So there's two crap websites just for you.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:24.660]   There you go.
[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:26.660]   Endless scrolling.
[01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:32.900]   I launch a nuclear rocket into the UK car leasing industry.
[01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:33.940]   You can trust me.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:37.580]   I'm laying great.
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:39.340]   Isn't that great?
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:40.540]   I like Cameron's world too.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:43.700]   We're going to, we're going to save both of those bookmark them for some time when
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.380]   you have some free time.
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:53.460]   And samba.com is still around, by the way.
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.340]   Have you seen zombo.co?
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.340]   No.
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:59.700]   It's the web 2.0 version of zombo.
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:01.740]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:02.740]   Or not.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:13.140]   And here's the video from the original.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:18.140]   But it's the makeover because it's responsive multi-purpose.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:24.420]   20 years from now they'll look back at us and they'll be like, oh, that looks so dated.
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:26.420]   It's true.
[02:00:26.420 --> 02:00:27.420]   It's true.
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.420]   It's true.
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:31.860]   It was series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz.
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:35.220]   Welcome to samba.com.
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:40.780]   Oh, zombo 2.0.
[02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:41.780]   This is great.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:45.300]   I'm glad I could contribute to the list of terrible websites.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.940]   I've looked all the bad clip art you'd ever want.
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:50.340]   That's great.
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:51.340]   That's so great.
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:53.940]   Matt, you got something for us?
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:54.940]   Sure.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:58.540]   Yeah, if you're on the other end of the spectrum from the GeoCity side and you're trying to
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:04.300]   make more of the zombo.co side, there's a site called LibraStock.com.
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:10.220]   And the idea behind it is that it searches something like 30 different free sources of
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:11.220]   pictures.
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:13.180]   And so you can go to LibraStock.com.
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:14.780]   I can't vouch for this site.
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:18.500]   I saw it on Hacker News like a week ago and was searching.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.100]   And it seems to have some pretty good stuff.
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:23.660]   So you can search for tree or money or blog or whatever.
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:28.100]   And it'll have little hashtags that you can click on to do searches for those terms.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:32.380]   But as I understand it, yeah, these pictures are free for you to use for your blog.
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:36.740]   They're creative commons or I believe whatever you want.
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:42.860]   I haven't dug all the way down, but it seems like all the ones I've searched on, they say
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:43.860]   that they're free to you.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:44.860]   Nice.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:48.380]   And you get, oh, so some of this is based on stock photo sites where they give you free
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:50.780]   images and you can get those.
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:51.780]   Oh, this is great.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:54.580]   It's almost like a meta search on top.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:55.580]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:56.940]   Yeah, very nice.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:57.940]   Nice.
[02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:04.020]   It's called Libra L-I-B-R-E stock at LibraStock.com.
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:06.820]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:11.260]   So you might think that Facebook is the whole internet and everything on the internet is
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:14.300]   just jammed with advertising.
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:18.940]   But marketing land, a quarter of a study from social makers, I haven't heard of them.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:24.300]   They calculated that only 3% of news feeds is ads on Facebook.
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:25.300]   Wow.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:29.820]   Now compare that to most any magazine you get.
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:33.100]   That's going to run anywhere from 30 to 50% advertising.
[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:35.420]   Radio is 19 minutes an hour.
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:38.580]   Network television is 16 minutes an hour.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:39.740]   25%.
[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:41.980]   So that's 3% is nothing.
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:42.980]   Nothing.
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:43.980]   It's nothing.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:46.860]   I'm going to give you one more number today from Digby.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:48.900]   I'm something for you to digby's last name.
[02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:51.380]   I apologize from BuzzFeed.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:59.340]   He said that they calculated a BuzzFeed that people scroll 8 and a half feet a day.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:03.900]   As tall as the tallest man.
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:04.900]   Oh my god.
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:06.540]   8 and a half feet a day of scrolling.
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.940]   That even seems low, doesn't it?
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:09.940]   It does.
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:14.220]   It seems like I've scrolled many more, many more miles than that.
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:17.260]   And miles rather scroll before I sleep.
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:20.300]   Miles more scroll before you sleep.
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:24.180]   Oh, it's so fun to have the old gang back together.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.940]   This is a classic episode.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:27.740]   Oh, it is great.
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:30.260]   Really great.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.540]   Someday, Gina, you will come back to us, right?
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:35.380]   I will always come back anytime.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.460]   Every month, come back.
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:38.540]   Every month, every month for sure.
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.780]   Gina, Trappani is of course on Google Plus.
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:44.860]   You can find her at ThinkUp.com and her latest is Makerbase.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:48.660]   That's M-A-K-E-R-B-A.S-E.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:55.900]   If you're a maker or you know someone who is a maker, add them to the Maker database.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:00.380]   It's free and everybody must contribute.
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:02.620]   I have a little thing to promote.
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:05.860]   I'm doing an ask me anything on product hunt tomorrow.
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:06.860]   Oh, yes, that's right.
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:11.620]   It has that new live where they do AMAs with different people.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:14.580]   And I think, and I don't know if I'm supposed to share this, but I actually think it's going
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:15.580]   to be video.
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:18.740]   So it's going to be a full hour of me answering questions.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:22.660]   I get tons of questions from listeners and viewers and I try to, you know, just throughout
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:24.220]   the week and the day and the months and stuff.
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:27.540]   And I try to answer as many as I can, but I often can't get to anything.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:29.660]   So I can't get to everything.
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.900]   So if you've got a burning question for me, come check it out.
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:37.420]   I think it's tomorrow at 11 AM Pacific to be on Eastern.
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:38.420]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:43.460]   So you can go to productton.com/live and you can sign up there and the video will be archived
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:44.860]   if you can't make it at that time.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:45.860]   That's neat.
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:47.340]   I did it in one, but it wasn't a video.
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:48.340]   So that's great.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:49.340]   Yeah, I think the video.
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:52.020]   I've already done the AMAs.
[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:53.020]   I'm sorry?
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:54.740]   Have any of you done AMAs?
[02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:55.740]   Unread it?
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:56.740]   Yeah.
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:58.740]   Yeah, I've done two.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:59.940]   I've done two.
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:01.440]   You've done two.
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:02.440]   It's fun.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:04.440]   Highly recommend it.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:08.560]   But product on its very similar to a text-based Reddit AMA.
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.300]   So I'm glad to hear they're doing video now, too.
[02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:11.300]   That's great.
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:12.300]   That's cool.
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:13.300]   What a great lineup of people.
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:14.920]   I mean, they're doing a great job.
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:17.780]   And every day there's another one, sometimes several a day.
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:21.500]   Yeah, this sounds like I like taking the form and advancing it like this.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:22.500]   That's what's great.
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:23.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:24.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:25.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:26.500]   Very nice.
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:32.260]   So everybody should just go to productton.com/live and you can sign up to talk with Gina tomorrow
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:33.260]   11 AM Pacific.
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:34.260]   Yeah.
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:37.760]   Matt Cuts, what are you up to these days?
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:42.400]   I'll say I'm old, same old, but I will mention, you know, the Google Webmaster blog, always
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:50.120]   a good place for questions about 301s, 302s, HTTPS, you know, keywords, crawling JavaScript,
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:51.120]   all that sort of stuff.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:55.320]   Google Webmaster blog is a good spot to go because even though I've been sort of on
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:00.520]   sabbatical on leave, the people there are still fighting spam and talking about how
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:03.140]   they're tackling hacked sites and all sorts of great stuff.
[02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:06.520]   So they deprecated the Ajax crawling scheme.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:09.420]   We talked about that last week with the Barry Schwartz.
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.480]   Yeah, they're, they finally are getting smart enough.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.480]   So that's good.
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:16.480]   Details there.
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:18.420]   That's the kind of thing they talk about.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.860]   House spam is tackled.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:22.500]   Things like that.
[02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:25.340]   They just rolled out a really good change to tackle hacked sites.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:29.500]   So you know, and yeah, all sorts of good stuff on that blog.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.180]   What's your 30 day challenge this month?
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:34.660]   I'm trying.
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:35.660]   I tried to.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.660]   I was going to eat mindfully, which I'm stuck with.
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:41.020]   And then I was going to do no mobile devices.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:45.860]   And I have so not to stick with the eating mindfully.
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:46.860]   My suggestion.
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:47.860]   Yeah.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:48.860]   Yeah.
[02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:51.300]   I've ordered many more mobile devices instead.
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:55.940]   So then they came out with a six P damn them.
[02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:56.940]   Yeah.
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.620]   It's been a it's not a good time to give up mobile, I think.
[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:00.900]   It's mobile that.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:01.900]   Yeah.
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:03.540]   Oh, I love the.
[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:06.460]   So that it's self improvement that Leo's just like, all right.
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:07.940]   Yeah, Matt, what are you working on this month?
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:09.380]   I know every month.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:10.380]   It's good.
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:11.380]   It's good.
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:12.780]   It keeps me honest.
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:15.260]   It's nice.
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:17.540]   And I'm living to Bobby listening to.
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:20.020]   Say again, do a 28 day challenge in February.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:22.140]   Do you do a 28 day challenge?
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:23.140]   Yeah.
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.700]   Usually I stick with the month.
[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:26.900]   It gets just easier to keep track up that way.
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:29.780]   Sometimes you don't have to do it as long and sometimes you get a day off.
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:30.780]   So.
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:32.780]   Okay.
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:35.020]   Well, you know, a week in Nebraska is kind of like a month.
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:36.420]   So I think you did it.
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:43.420]   Oh, I might steal that if you don't mind.
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:44.420]   Been there.
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:45.420]   Lots of corn.
[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:46.420]   It's actually very nice.
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:47.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:48.420]   The weather's been really nice.
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:49.420]   People have been very friendly.
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:50.420]   So I can't complain.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:51.420]   Oh, everybody's very friendly there.
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:53.300]   Thank you so much for being a part of the show, Matt.
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:54.300]   We appreciate it.
[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:55.300]   You too, Gina.
[02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:56.300]   Of course, Jeff.
[02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:57.500]   Do we be talking to you?
[02:07:57.500 --> 02:07:59.340]   What town will you be in next Wednesday?
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:00.340]   Berlin.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:01.340]   Ah, nice.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.340]   I hear they have internet in Berlin these days.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.340]   So I hope so.
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:10.780]   Obviously the hotel is the one where all of the kind of Soviet officials used to stay
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:11.780]   at Alexander Platts.
[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:13.020]   Oh, you're in East Berlin.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:14.740]   Oh, I've got it.
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.740]   I bet there's a few few old buggies left on the walls.
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:18.740]   Cool.
[02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:19.980]   Won't that be fun?
[02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:21.820]   We will we'll be talking to you next week.
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:22.820]   11 a.m.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:23.820]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:27.780]   I'm Pacific for 30 Eastern 2030 UTC on Wednesdays.
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:29.700]   It's this week in Google.
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:33.140]   Thanks to our producer Jason Howell for putting the show together.
