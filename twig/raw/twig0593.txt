[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.840]   Okay, that's what I meant slots. It's a I don't even know how to gamble, but I know this much
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Yeah, I told you she was the smartest of the bunch
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.880]   So Google's in a little bit of it's a boy Google has had a very interesting no good very bad
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.440]   2020 that is now stretching into 2021. I don't know
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.600]   It seems like they did not they were kind of fighting unit unionizing at Google in fact. Oh, yeah, according to motherboard
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.640]   It wasn't a seab. Yeah, they did. Yeah
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.640]   motherboard they hired a company called IRI consultants. It's a union avoidance firm kind of like the Pinkerton's
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   detective firm
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.200]   The apparent there was this motherboard article said that they these this union busting firm
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.840]   Which is what it really is compiles dossiers on employees
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.080]   They didn't get information about their Google research, but they got a spreadsheet created
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.840]   in an attempt to thwart a union drive at two Seattle hospitals in
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.200]   2019 and every employee was in the spreadsheet
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.680]   categorized by personality temperament motivations ethnicity family background spout it's kind of like what you would do if you
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   got that's just their HR file
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:54.320]   Everybody I'm sure spouses employment finances health issues work ethic job performance disciplinary history and involvement in union activity
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.960]   Each employee was then giving a rating for how likely the company believed they were to vote for the union in
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.680]   One notes for one employee according to motherboard. IRI consultants wrote they were lazy money oriented a luff
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.000]   from Samoa tired of people on team and doesn't want to assist them and told the managers the union is full of crap
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.760]   This is gold this is like what you do a jury selection, right?
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.320]   Also like the dossiers that PR firms keep on journalists. Oh, I bet you is extensive. Yeah
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.760]   Stacy Hagenboth of you lazy money oriented aloof
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.320]   I have some of my dossier
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah, Dvorak always say what do they say about you?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.720]   Mostly that I'm there their way she would expect they're like Stacy's really informed and is terrible
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.280]   They also say that I'm terrible at answering emails
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.860]   Oh from from flax. Yeah, but from flax. They also said I tended to be sympathetic. This was
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.960]   Distressing yeah, that would hurt that is an out right you can say I'm from Samoa, but don't say I'm sympathetic
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.000]   I'm hopeful that part of it, you know, I didn't see the whole thing
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.280]   But maybe that's more because I focus on technical stuff. I think I'm I don't know. I don't think you're sympathetic. I think you
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Listen and understand you're not out to get anybody. Maybe they maybe if you're in PR
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.120]   Somebody who's not out to get you is sympathetic
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.280]   So Stacy in your in your earlier cup reporter days
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.560]   When I would do a story on somebody like in San Francisco and they would
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.680]   A subject would compliment me on the story. I would my reflex was to think what they do wrong
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.720]   For some of my stories, I mean obviously there there are two classes of stories when you're a cup reporter
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.120]   There's your basic news and then there's the profiles they assign you to get everybody on your beat accustomed to you
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.960]   And those I never felt as bad if someone said it was a good story
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.280]   Right, okay. That's fair. Yeah, but yeah
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.120]   to vorac took great pride
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.320]   Told this story for many years
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.800]   He was walking around Microsoft and one of the head to the I think it was the oh
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.280]   I can't remember her name, but she eventually started her own firm
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.960]   But she was in charge of Microsoft here at the time had an enemies list on the chalkboard his name was on it
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   He took great pride in that
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.160]   He would if anyone would you would yeah? Oh god. I'm on the enemies list. Yeah, that's okay
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.720]   You want if you're a journalist, I like that though
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.040]   You don't want to be I kept I kept a letter from
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:42.600]   Be threatening to sue me for some of my reporting that they never actually did and I kept the SEC SEC filing and inquiry from that same
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.320]   They didn't so like there was a point of pride. I was like, ah
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   I have a tack letters. I review of a
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.200]   Think it was a time lapse camera some company didn't like what I thought of it and
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.560]   Next thing you know, they sent all their fans at them. You tell them. Yeah
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.880]   I didn't know what I was doing didn't know how to check the settings and yada yada yada
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.200]   And I just laughed it off. Oh, I hate that my folks on them and said hey here have at it. Told him
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   I really hate that I just
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   That's why I
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.800]   Don't ever take I don't want to hear from Pierre people. I don't take freebies. I just you know, it's not
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.960]   Free beer nothing is just I did my review. No, I just don't want to have a relationship with them
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.160]   Yeah, I don't want to have any relationship with them at all
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.560]   Don't have to attack letters for Bill Cosby. Well, now that's not that's a badge of honor
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:40.240]   Wait, was it a pre those pre as long as three, but I still take great pride is it cuz you reviewed the Cosby show?
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, well cuz I said when I'm former TV credit TV got a credit don't forget
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.000]   We have to add that's my lower third
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.840]   so I
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:58.040]   Like Cosby I loved Cosby the early days, but then we got preachy. I said so he got raged. He sent me a
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.960]   Tin cup and said you know, where are the flowers for my funeral? It made no sense. That's what he did
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.600]   I
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.160]   Were we started every weekly I had a fake cover. There was on the truck mail that said kiss Cosby
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.560]   Goodbye, it was about Murphy Brown and Roseanne Barr and he had he managed to find a copy and got very at the time very
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:24.380]   Expensive work done to have it redone kiss Jarvis. Goodbye Wow Wow nowadays with Photoshop any tweeter can do it
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:31.420]   Take a second. Yeah, I had I had a whiny letter from Alan thick asking me to stop making him my my
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.920]   Punching bag
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   Yeah, that's a good word
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.120]   That's what Stacy
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:48.520]   Frank Sinatra stopped in the middle of a song what circle star theater in San Carlos, California to call me a bum
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.960]   As that
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.600]   Wow, I saw Frank was it the red pack I saw him at circle star was it with Sami and benefit
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.200]   Oh, it was a different concert. I'd cover it was a benefit
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.640]   He did a paid concert and circle star wait a minute. He said hey this Jeff Jarvis that wasn't there
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.160]   I wasn't there. I'm driving the next morning sounding morning
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.080]   I'm listening the radio because well that's what we had radio
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   Hey kids used to be that we turn it on and it came through the air
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.760]   I know that's so somebody said did you hear your brother Sinatra last night?
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   Yeah, he went after Jarvis. He stopped in the middle of singing my way to go on a rant and call me a bum Wow
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.000]   Honestly, you put my rant. That's the very first thing I put in the list
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.280]   Sinatra called me a bum that should be on your tombstone. That's awesome. Well, it might have been so friends set me
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.160]   Black flowers afterwards because I was gonna oh wow
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.200]   Anyway, back to Google
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.860]   Right, sorry Jeff really ego boy. We really went down a ram and hole there
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.680]   So that's not the apparently according to motherboard IRI consultants was asked but they had no comment
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.760]   But there is another consultant from at least one other Union avoidance firm
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.000]   So they got a wall. Yeah
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.320]   So Google the other shoe that dropped on this is the Google's several hundred Google employees have now
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.800]   Unionized which is something that does not happen often in Silicon Valley
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.120]   the alphabet workers Union
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:33.100]   400 Google engineers and other workers engineers is important because those are the most valuable workers at Google
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.600]   Those are the ones that you work the hardest to get you recruit hard. You want to get the best. There's a lot of competition
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.240]   And it's hard for Google to piss them off as you know because when the engineers have said no
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.960]   We don't want to do that defense work Google said okay
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   Having them unionized is a big deal
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.200]   The Union they'll the alphabet workers Union
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.080]   Was organized in secret according to the New York Times for the better part of a year elected its leadership last month
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.720]   They're part of the communication workers of America
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   Which actually now have job security
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.160]   Yeah, do they?
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.400]   Apparently yeah, you can't oh if Google fired any of them
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.080]   Yeah, they got their pictures on the unions pay homepage they
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.760]   Yeah, the pictures are there. No, you cannot fire them you get deep trouble. So so
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:30.040]   WA is very it's a problem for many telcos and they also represent media too apparently
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.280]   Didn't Google see this coming though considering all of the yeah, that's why they hired all those pink
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.520]   That's why the hair of the company. Yeah, you know yeah
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.120]   the alphabet workers Union is a so-called minority Union because Google
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.000]   Has 260,000 employees and only 400 Union members
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.840]   It workers said it was primarily an effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google rather than negotiate for contract
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.160]   And that's because Google has been it's alleged
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:05.120]   Pretty active in censoring punishing even firing activists at Google
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.960]   What's the way way way way way way way that's also say that they're not negotiating because they're all paid incredible amounts of money
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.080]   Right and so it's you know unless you're a guard and they are letting the freelancers in but but basically
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:24.040]   Googlers are so damn rich that to have this to have them poor mouth as a union in gonna play very well
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.400]   So it's a different matter. Yeah, that's exactly what the
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.920]   Chewy Shaw an engineer at Google and vice chair of the unions leadership council said our goals
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.360]   I love the name chewy our goal the name chewy. I want to be named after a wookie apparently our goals
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.440]   Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of are people getting paid enough our issues are much broader
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.960]   It is a time where a union is an answer to these problems
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:58.320]   Google's director people operations Cara Silverstein says we've always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding marketplace
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.200]   I'm sorry workplace for our workforce
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   But of course new our employees have protected labor rights that we support and as we've always done
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.840]   We'll continue engaging directly with all our employees. I don't know
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.280]   I
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   think this is really
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.360]   Really interesting and it could be a debacle in the sense
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   So what I think is most interesting is that this is having both the engineering and the contract workers
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.880]   Which if you look at the tech industry the tech is just industry is like if you're not an engineer
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.480]   What is your freakin point? You're like a freeloader on the back right?
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.440]   Right. We're carrying. Yeah. Yes. So and that's that's if you're a professional like accounting marketing CFO or
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.040]   If you're God help you a janitor or driver
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.720]   So I think the fact that all of these are together
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.980]   Could be good if it helps engineers
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.200]   understand the concerns that
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.120]   other work workers have
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:03.160]   But it also could be a debacle because the engineers are gonna want an aim for things that a bus driver is like
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.040]   They're good. I don't care about this. So I just think
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.720]   It will be interesting to see given the power
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.120]   Dynamics here and the perceived value that engineers have if they will
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.280]   Use that only to their advantage if they'll learn
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.400]   Or if it will just not work because they can't come together
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.080]   So our chat room says that
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.000]   They should let the wookiee win
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.240]   Yeah, we'll play it is not the not the only Silicon Valley company to be unionized a Kickstarter employees have unionized
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.600]   Glitch this is from the New York Times article and a small group of contractors at a Google office in Pittsburgh
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.880]   unionized last in 2019 and of course
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:59.120]   Amazon warehouse workers are are set it to vote in the next coming months about unionizing
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.480]   There tends to be among young people and among the white collar workers in elite
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:12.200]   In this generation kind of an anti-union sentiment like why they first they hate unions not in media
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.080]   Yeah, I'm an union guy. I'm after it all that yeah, but
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.840]   The you the Google
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.320]   Alphabet workers in union has to pay 1% of their salary to Union Union dues people don't like that
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.120]   If you're well if you're already well compensated and you get good vacation time your benefits are good
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.320]   You might say well what's the union gonna do for us, you know that we can't do already
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.480]   There is definitely anti-union sentiment in this one is Andrew hate unions
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.280]   Does he doesn't even have to do employees or he yeah, he used to actually way back in the day
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.320]   He worked for AT&T and he
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   People oh so you know from CWA no CWA he knows he to be yeah
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.000]   He he and he's he's he's an old-school Republican. I'll be honest
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.720]   I mean we we have very different views on the world. I don't know where he stands now
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:08.400]   I mean, I know he's not that the today Republican because that's yeah, that was only when he was working that's cause for the war
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.120]   But he's a physical conservative and very pro capitalism although he's
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:22.960]   Still a lot of work unions balance unions balance the capitalist point of view as well
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.040]   I think Amazon warehouse workers are perfect example of a group that should unite. Oh, yeah
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.840]   I'm sort of half and half on it. I get it from an employer standpoint if I were in that
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:41.320]   Leadership role like you miss the forward and and versus being someone in the warehouse. I'd very diplomatic of you to say
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:47.480]   Seriously, but it's I see both sides of it
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.920]   Queen Pruitt could have been a part of a union at one point in time and I
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.960]   Remember discussing it with her and saying you know
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.440]   There's there's some good things because they can offer you certain protections and that's right there quotes
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.600]   That's right that you can't get yourself
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   It's collective bargaining and I think that there's a lot to be said for that
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.080]   But I also but there's also lots of examples of corrupt unions corrupt union
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.680]   Yes, you know that you know, there's a lot of others
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   You can't I mean if by that argument I could say well capitalism and business just sucks because there's so many right
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.940]   That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there there are counters
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:32.560]   There are reaction to the overwhelming power that that's right businesses and corporations have over people
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.220]   Yes, and you could say the United Auto Workers really improved a lot of
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.800]   Workers on Ford's
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.060]   Assembly line and other companies assembly lines. They really were a very powerful union
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:51.160]   And then perhaps went a little bit in the wrong direction with Jimmy Hoffa and so forth
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.860]   But is there is the power power power? It's power corrupting you
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:05.200]   Yeah, so here's my wish here's my dearest wish I want at least a special if not a sequel from Silicon Valley with episodes about the Google Union
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.860]   Imagine a
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:14.060]   Picket line that would be awesome. They're all they're going around the picket line on motorized scooters or skateboards, right?
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.060]   I think they get free lunch there
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.300]   What would a Google picket line look like it would be full of segues?
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:28.500]   So that's what I'm worried about as a union. They're like focused on things like free lunch or enough
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.100]   vegetarian options when
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.700]   We're striking for more
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:41.140]   I'm just saying that oh more beef
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.460]   But that was always what Silicon Valley did is they created an environment
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:53.740]   Not merely to bust unions because that was also how they recruited but they really created an environment where you wouldn't want a union because you were so happy because you had
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.220]   Napped pods and free lunch and free dry cleaning and you know, multi colored bicycles
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.980]   So I can understand that Silicon Valley does it?
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.500]   It is antithetical to the idea of moving fast and breaking things
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.660]   It's just more of an impediment and people like you know Larry Page
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:18.740]   They don't want they don't want any regulations getting away. They want to they want to innovate freely. I understand the tension there
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.860]   I really do
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:27.180]   so remember when everyone talked about Google being the best place to work in the USA you remember all of those press public publications and
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:35.300]   Where is that now? Are people still trying to model after that type of environment for the workplace or to say oh well?
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.660]   You know what they?
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.820]   Intercept their bounds a little bit being a little too friendly to me. I'm a friendly
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.300]   What do you think Jeff you wrote the book? What would Google do?
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:49.460]   I think that's a really interesting question. It's really interesting and and yeah, you know
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.540]   Google number one place to work was often a number of the week on the show
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.460]   because it came up and and
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:04.540]   That's really interesting there because in a way did they did they screw themselves if you compare it let's compare for a second
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:12.180]   How about this Amazon versus Google right so Google here's the bikes here's the lifetime benefits
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.700]   Here's the free lunch. Here's all the swag here's everything you want here's all this right
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.260]   Amazon never went that route Amazon said this is a job and
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:28.080]   Asses on you very famously they didn't have desks. They had doors on saw horses right
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.460]   Bezos food yeah, they he established this kind of
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.660]   Congality as a company value
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.860]   the the last two companies that I worked for were just
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.740]   wildly different forest culture goes and the first company we did try to have a bit of that
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:54.660]   fun environment the way Google tried to do it with with their people with having a lot more outings and
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.660]   Just little random activities throughout the day all while getting our work done
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.300]   then
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:08.980]   Really hate those give me money hours was a lot of fun and then it started in the nicer guy man
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.780]   It started an IT department
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:18.260]   But I noticed that it trickled over to the other departments and it just sort of made the place just a great place to work
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:23.300]   People were really happy to then drive came to work for us and no hold on
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.340]   And then I went to the next company and it was like a whole 180 flip it was
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.900]   Totally different nobody knew who each other were
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.260]   leadership was
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.580]   You know, they just did what they needed to do check the numbers and they went on about the business and everybody else
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.340]   Just did their job and that was fine too because you didn't have to worry about a lot of political crap
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.700]   You just hey are we working today? Yes, we're working today get the job done go home in the store
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:56.020]   Yeah, so I had to answer your question. I just looked up the glass door best places to work 2020
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.580]   Everyone I guess what number one is it's a it's a technology
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.780]   for
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:09.740]   Hub spot wait what zap pose hub spot hub spot that's the company that are
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.460]   All right, no, it's in Boston
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:18.900]   Boston, okay, that's the company that our dear friend wrote that mocking book about
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:27.140]   Andrew Kean, Dan Lyons. That's right Dan Lyons right right exactly number two is big
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.020]   Dane and company because they're all effing rich
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:38.080]   Number three is docuSign get this number four before ready in and out burger because the French fries, right?
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.020]   No
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:46.260]   Because they give their employees health care and they have they pay more than minimum wage the French fries are dark
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.940]   And the French fries are pretty good, but you end up smelling my French fries when you go home from that's true
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.020]   So it's a it's a it's a mixed way down the win way companies
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:58.340]   Haven't heard of Lawrence little more lab is number six. Hey, let's make some nuclear bombs
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.340]   That's a fun thing to do every day
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:10.100]   I'm like research labs are awesome. I know I know well when I worked at the examiner
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.540]   I did a story on Lawrence little more inventing the neutron bomb
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:18.780]   So Lawrence little more has done some things that may not hey
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.860]   I just got a breaking story from Mike Isaac who is a New York Times a tech reporter. He says
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.620]   Facebook has remember
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:31.700]   You may remember if you listen to this later in the week that as we recorded this the Capitol building had been stormed
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:37.500]   The president posted on his Twitter account and his Facebook account a video saying I love you
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.460]   thank you. Yeah, we won but go home and
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.940]   That video has now been removed from Facebook. Oh
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:51.340]   Twitter put up a rule that you couldn't like it or retweet it, but you could quote tweet it. Yeah
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.900]   Yeah, I saw it add on Twitter, but they face but totally pulled it. That's according to Mike Isaac and
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.820]   They finally found some cuts. Yeah. Wow
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.220]   It's interesting because he does say go home
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.740]   Yeah, he says
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:14.220]   But he did say hey people we need to do the right thing go homeless keep everybody safe. Yeah, yeah, that's a wink
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.620]   It was still inciting there was interesting both Twitter and Facebook seemed to agree on that
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.660]   It's a yeah
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:29.980]   It's not I mean he did he's already incited and now he can sit back and be like, oh exactly okay y'all go
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   Yeah
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:38.380]   Are you want to know what number of Google is the top 100 places work work what guess please is it below in and out burger?
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.140]   Because honestly if you have any choice I take in and out I mean I it's below Southwest Airlines. What?
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:49.300]   Southwest is not a bad place to work. Yeah, it's number 11
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.140]   Oh, that's not terrible
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.420]   12 is linked in 14 is Trader Joe's where's Apple on that list? Oh
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.220]   Nice a hip search way down there
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:08.340]   84 84 apples is we don't need you miss where Apple. Oh, yeah, Apple's not a fun place to work. Yeah. No, they're mean
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.940]   Wow
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:16.980]   That that's so many people I know so many people including people who worked worked for us who took jobs in Apple now
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.780]   Honestly, I I think Google would be a great place to work
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.660]   but yes, it just seems to me that it would be a really fun place to work, but
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.460]   who knows I
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:33.180]   Really would rather work at Google. They're not taking into account pay scales because honestly
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.100]   I think the lowest paid employee Google probably makes more than the best paid in an out burger
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:43.380]   Well, but not everybody is motivated by I mean after a certain pay point. Yeah, you're kind of like am I?
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.300]   Crushing people's spirits by taking this job and you know, it's like working for Palantir
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.540]   Some people would do it, but not everybody so is where's Microsoft of the list?
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.400]   I'd say I would work for Microsoft. Yeah, I'd say the pie
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:05.460]   They probably have climbed over the last decade what what anyone where's my croissant is Facebook even on the list
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.800]   I don't I wouldn't want to work for Facebook. Not now. What are you probably not now?
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:19.140]   Yeah, with as low as Google is ranked. It's still a best among its peers, which is interesting. Yeah, and Facebook is better than Apple
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.580]   What where's Salesforce?
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:28.060]   Salesforce is number 12. I think oh right after Google. No, no, I'm sorry
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.100]   I'm sorry run run run that's linked in right
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:36.420]   They'll they're all look like a link to a Microsoft or now the same commercial or same company salesforce is 34
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.220]   Below wegmans I'm 30
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.060]   Anyway, anyway, okay
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:48.420]   Yeah, you get credit you got numbers you're done with numbers for the next six weeks
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.980]   Google has a new oh should I save this for a change longer is this the nest cam? No, it's not out yet
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.980]   That'll be a change
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.380]   That's why I brought it up. I wanted to give Stacy something throw a bone. Oh
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.620]   I don't need your bones
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.820]   Google confirms plans for a new nest cam lineup
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:17.340]   I've used the nest cam IQ outdoors, but that's apparently now discontinued
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.460]   You can't buy that
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.940]   Yay
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.540]   Why yay, no, I just I don't think I don't think well
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:35.060]   Here's what I think needs to happen. They need to redo their lineup with an eye towards today's costs because yeah
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:43.240]   $100 for a camera. Yeah is way beyond what why's yeah, and you credit to wise for bringing that number way down
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:49.700]   Yeah, even I mean even Logitech cameras the Arlo cameras which are expensive but are not that expensive so
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.580]   anyway
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:57.620]   Google says it will continue to support its existing cameras with security updates and even new features
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.020]   And they haven't released anything since 2017 in fact
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.580]   They released it. Oh and the nest camera then then the camera line. Yeah, okay
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.460]   Yeah, I think what they're doing if we look at Google's like smart home device strategy
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.460]   I actually think this is not a terrible thing
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:21.580]   they focus on cameras then they do a refresh of the thermostat then they do
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:27.420]   Usually something different right so I don't think you need a new camera every year for example
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.420]   I think it's totally reasonable to go three years
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.020]   According to an FCC filing they have also
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.980]   Preparing a new nest hub that's their
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:47.940]   The the screen thing with solely gestures. Those are the gestures they built in the pixel 4 never took advantage of them and
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:56.460]   Limited pixel 5 that's where you stop and swipe and all that stuff. I think that might be useful and something static like that
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.660]   It should and I don't know we talked about this on our show this morning
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.860]   but
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.540]   It's also having peripheral devices available that run with Bluetooth and you're also see thread
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.720]   So that's three really significant radio announcements there
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.860]   Thread because I think that's gonna be the format for communicating using project connected home over IP, right?
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.620]   Three the Bluetooth peripherals means something maybe sensors
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:29.220]   I don't I'm trying to figure out what you'd like can I have it your hub talk directly to things via Bluetooth is kind of neat
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.060]   I there is something happened to my so there's two kinds of nest hubs
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.580]   There's one with the camera the hub max and then there's one without a camera
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.740]   Which is the one in my bedroom now when the one when I come within proximity the one with the camera
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:47.220]   It says oh, hi Leo. Here's your calendar. Here's some, you know, it knows it's me because it recognizes me and it makes us out
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.220]   And you know it kind of announces that it's see me
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:56.660]   Just lately in last few weeks the one without the camera has started noticing. I'm around and I'm baffled
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.420]   Which one a little screen no, no, no, it's Google. That's a nest up a minute
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.100]   It's the little nest hub
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   Camera
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:14.300]   I don't it must recognize maybe I don't know I haven't it's just
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:19.100]   The same kind of thing that happens with the one with the camera is now starting to happen with a little one
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:25.260]   When I'm in the proximity to it and I thought that is not that's that's bizarre
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.620]   They're saying now Spooter X says it uses Sonics
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.380]   To do oh is this
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.420]   Yeah, it could be although are you though?
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.620]   How would it recognize Leo or does it recognize people or does it just automatically think a person is you?
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   Oh, that's a good question
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:47.940]   Ultrasound sensing on the nest up in the nest hub that takes you to another level of convenience
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:55.300]   By customizing your favorite Google nest display depending on your distance from your device
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:02.820]   Yeah, that's what we thought was solely last time, but it wasn't it was the ultra side uses the speakers in the microphones
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.900]   To determine whether a person I guess yeah, you're right. It doesn't know who it is is
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:14.300]   Approaching within approximately four to six feet your device's speaker will amiss soft sighing sounds. Oh, no
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.220]   Which would be nice
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.340]   That was just me a few states. Sorry soft in audible
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.860]   Sonic
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.580]   Soft inaudible ultrasonic pulses
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:38.380]   Which are reflected off nearby objects in the room the microphones so it's using it's using sonar
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.980]   me
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.740]   Wow
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:48.300]   Occasionally other things in your home environment may cause ultrasonic noise and may disrupt it
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.620]   For a brief period
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.860]   Wow
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.020]   That's not okay. Now that's that's a little bit on the creepy line
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:04.580]   No, no, we talked about this like a year ago. It's not creepy. It's not creepy like it's basically saying
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.620]   There is something here. You are you interact with it? You are here
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.380]   Hello, what do we call it heavy breathing? That's creepy
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:21.080]   But if it's just like Amazon on the other hand is gonna watch what are we calling a weird computing self-aware computing
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   Remember that conversation last. Oh, okay. I must have forgot. Yeah
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.520]   You do more shows than we do about this
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:34.840]   Freaked me out yes, we talked we talked about it. How do you know? I'm here. I know how my
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:42.500]   Guess yeah, it's less intrusive than a camera and remember if you're farther away and you ask at the temperature
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:48.880]   It'll give it to you a big type and if you get closer, it'll smush it. So it's yeah supposedly will do that. Yeah, I
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:55.460]   Yeah, look it. I'm obviously not completely up on what mine could do because I just recently discovered I could watch TV on it
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.380]   Because I subscribe to YouTube TV and I found out I could say hey
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.080]   Hey, not nest map hub play
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:08.880]   CNN on YouTube TV and I can so I can last night when I went to bed and I was following the lecture results and I got tired
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.800]   I just turned it on there and was lulled to sleep by wolf blitzers gentle
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:20.440]   When you tell it how long to play it so serrations to go off as a sleep as a sleep timer. Yeah, okay
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.600]   That's kind of nice
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   Watch the ball game
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   Oh, you could just go to sleep or he's gonna sleep
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.700]   You know what I've ordered a you have sleep and sonar we should we should just jump ahead for one second to the Amazon story online
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.260]   67 just to piss you off
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:42.540]   Not actually it's a democracy I decided okay contact
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.980]   When we were on the other year and twitch show
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.520]   Our relationship shocked the other participants like you guys really have a strange relationship
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:35:00.500]   Radar
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.760]   radar sleep apnea tracker
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:10.060]   So this is actually like so solely I'll tie it to Google for you here Google's project solely it also
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:17.300]   Uses millimeter wave they use radar as well to detect gestures pretty close what this is doing again
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.960]   This I don't think this is creepy, but it is important to understand how this works
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:29.180]   It emits the signal and it when it uses that the bounce back to see what you're doing
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:36.060]   And it's basically what Amazon's doing that's worth noting is that it's created an algorithm to watch how you breathe to detect
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.860]   That's obviously machine learning because yes, it's not something you could say well if it goes
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:50.700]   That that's snoring it has to kind of you have to put a bunch of sleepers in front of it's about not breathing
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.740]   It's it's right not doing the sound I think it's it's sensing. No, I understand it is exactly right
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:01.400]   It's it's looking at some part of either the rise and fall of your chest or
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.620]   The way your head jerks back. Can I see air breathe? Can't see the movement of air
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.760]   I wonder think about how a bat uses sonar right or think how literally how radar works
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.340]   Yeah, well there you are
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:20.860]   You're throwing you're throwing the RF signal out right yeah, and it it runs into something
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.100]   It lets you know all right into this
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.980]   This is what that looks like and the algorithm they figured out that they're running against this is
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:36.540]   They're they know what the pattern of sleep apnea looks like right for that radar obviously with having done a lot of
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:43.940]   Training yes. Yes. This is this is not something you know you wouldn't necessarily know how to look for sleep apnea before you
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.220]   Headed into this this is a big push for Amazon into health tech
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.060]   We talked about the halo fitness tracker
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:57.220]   They did kill their haven effort the health insurance effort with JP morgue today. Oh, they ended up yep
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.700]   In a buffet. Yeah, they did that bus oh
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   We really thought they were gonna start to get into the health insurance business. That's interesting
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.580]   They did just launched their pharmacy service though, right?
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.080]   If you you can you can send them your prescription and they'll fulfill it
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.780]   Kind of like they're not leasing jets anymore either. They actually bought by a jet by in the jets
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.980]   It was big Seattle news
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.100]   Did they buy new ones or used ones?
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.980]   They're huge
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.980]   Delta and
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.240]   WestJet take that Boeing question. Thank you
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.860]   67
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.020]   Well, at least they bought Seattle company jets, right?
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:42.460]   Yep, I don't actually know yeah, seven sixty seven three hundred seven. Yeah, eleven of them
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.260]   They normally lease the seven sixty seven four hundredths, but
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:54.540]   There's also a race was too good to pass up. Oh gosh. I just you were blank. They could just snap up all the seven
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.380]   37 maxes it would have been you know, who cares if cargo goes down?
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.380]   No, I'm joking obviously
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.140]   So yeah
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.140]   All right, the max is now flying again
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.820]   The max I know would you get on it?
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:15.340]   Yeah, I would so I ordered it's actually waiting on my doorstep right now. I think this might be crazy. Oh, maki
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.100]   Yeah, no, I did that's not waiting for me. I wish it were I don't know whatever
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.740]   Supposedly I have an order in but I don't know where it is
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.100]   But that's another story for another day
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.540]   Bose makes the strangest in ear
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:33.980]   Buds ever because you can't listen to music with them. You can't listen to podcasts or books with them
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:39.580]   You can only listen to the 40 sounds on the Bose sleep app, but they're designed to help you
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.860]   Sleep you couldn't be there. They're designed to leave in your ear when you go to sleep
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:50.500]   I don't I hope they're comfortable, but they fly flat in your ear the sleep buds and then be down for that
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.580]   They play oceans. Is it the inter oral beats?
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:59.100]   Oh, no, well, I don't know I you know I I there ridiculous expensive considering you can't listen to music with them
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.460]   Yeah, that's not now you've lost me
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.700]   But I'll tell you well and you know what we could do
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.020]   I don't know we could talk about it when I when I get them
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.820]   But the reason is I have ten tinnitus tonight is in my ear and my tinnitus ringing in my ears and
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.460]   It's getting louder and
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.780]   You really hear it when it's dead quiet, you know at night when you're sleeping, right?
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.940]   It might be because I can mask it with certain white sounds. I don't hear it
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.460]   So I thought maybe what I should do is get these
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:32.860]   Put it on those sounds and maybe that will help so we'll see I'm gonna try it. We'll see
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.380]   I'm right for you on that. It's like ear plugs. It seals
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.920]   So it you know gets if you have a partner that snores or there's
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:47.660]   Street noise or whatever is keeping you up. It'll help in that regard, but I'm actually more interested in the cure for tonight
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:53.300]   So I'm envisioning kind of an IOT Stacy gone mad with all the things you can do in your sleep
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:59.540]   Well, I the other thing now that we mention it. I've got millimeter wave. I've got sonar waves
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:05.900]   I've got RF in my ears house. Is this all gonna end up being carcinogenic? Are we good?
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:11.140]   Oh, I thought you were gonna ask me about different RF interference, which is actually a huge issue
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.740]   I just don't want to die
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.140]   Okay
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:25.340]   There is research on some of this like every frequency band is different right so
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.460]   millimeter wave is
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:35.100]   For for all we know. I mean it's the stuff you run through in the airport. Yeah, I remember how I don't know about that
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:41.820]   Well, I don't know what frequency that it's at but we're also doing a lot of 5G deployments deployments are at well
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.820]   We know that causes covid
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:53.140]   Right. Oh, I forgot to mention. I also have a sleep tracker in in between my mattress and box spring that
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:59.620]   I think doing RF or I think it must be our sensor. I don't know because I mean
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.540]   There's RF because it's got to send the data to the phone well
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.620]   It's can no no it doesn't go to the phone. It's connected to a dongle, which has Wi-Fi so there's Wi-Fi
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.940]   But that's okay, so then there's no RF going no
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.900]   But I think it must be sending out something because it detects heart rate
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.060]   Breathing rate and motion so it's
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:24.300]   Pulses and waves that's why you can't sleep. Well, I'm just thinking I'll add more things to it
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:32.140]   Data visualization of all the all the rays going through Leo's body. Can you imagine? Oh not to mention
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.100]   I have a little bit of wave doesn't millimeter wave doesn't go through it attenuates
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:41.180]   None of this is is the kind of
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.360]   Radiation what do they call it that that can cause cancer none of it is that?
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.540]   microwave no no no no no
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.620]   People out in that strips out sell this that can enter your cell
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:57.900]   I can't remember the term. It'll come to me in about five minutes when nobody cares anymore
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.020]   It's just it's as well as he's ionizing. Thank you ruin your brain
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.440]   Ionizing radiant radiation so in theory
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.400]   Prevegion Leo
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.340]   Prevegion. Have you been taking that because I feel like I'm getting stupider
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:16.900]   My my nightmares is to end up on a plane when I finally had to fly again. Yeah my first flight
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:22.540]   I'm stuck next to one of those prevision people. You know, I'm 78 years old and I think better than ever
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:30.300]   Thanks to Prevegion. I'm a motivational speaker and I take Prevegion. You know I motivate you to take it. You know what?
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.580]   Jeff you and I watched too much that cable network
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.060]   I was like I have no idea if you watch the 20-year news channels
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.860]   Oh my lord
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:46.500]   It's as if everybody on watching those channels is in their 80s and they're dying of some
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:52.680]   Millet malady or other and then oh my god the worst part. I'm watching see you then accurate
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.860]   I'm watching CNN Tom Sellick comes on hey to sell me reverse mortgages
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:03.380]   So I case a quick MSNBC and there's Tom Sellick selling me reverse mortgages. You can't escape it
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.820]   What is Prevegion? Is that the one made out of octopus squid hits what yes, it's made out
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.260]   Well, that out of squid or something right? It's I and there's no how?
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:22.780]   The amount of money they spent on advertising is unbelievable. Well, it's apparently it's very expensive. Somebody's saying in the chatroom. I don't I'm not tempted
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:30.280]   No, I'm not either. No, I don't like those people. It's a supplement as we know FDA does not regulate supplements
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.680]   So anyway, if TMS RS
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:38.280]   Dissecc charged the most false and deceptive advertising last January. Oh Prevegion. Oh wow
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:48.440]   Well that 5g huh, how about that 5g so the this is a con this is the contrail of
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.600]   Technology, I would say is the RF cancer thing so
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.800]   There's research that shows that the research is not definitive
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.300]   I'm not I'm not super worried about all of this but you know you heard me
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.280]   I was more excited like oh, are we gonna talk about how we manage the interference between all this because there's
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.640]   Yeah, how do we manage that look at why don't you start that? I have to go get a drink of water go ahead and I'll be back
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.320]   It's it's it's super nerdy like electrical engineering stuff
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.400]   I this is what I read and like bring it times or no well
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.920]   I don't even know how to do this. I mean this is like magic antenna stuff
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.120]   You know antennas are like the dark magic of the internet, right?
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:34.840]   But if you think about it, we are I mean most homes will now have
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.880]   5 to 6 different plus cellular so this is just in our homes local
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.360]   Networks and then you've got cellular and then you've got whatever that like subgigger hurts
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.960]   That's in your microwave or your baby monitors or your garage door opener, but we've had those price
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.120]   Anyway, I
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.480]   Can't tell you how to manage this because I'm not a design
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.360]   electrical engineer
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.920]   I'm sorry, but we can come into a different story if we want to go back to
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:09.720]   Twitter and its recent acquisition of breaker
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.240]   You know considering what's happened in the podcast world with
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.120]   Spotify got one up everybody and
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:23.600]   Stitcher in our heart radio and so now Twitter hops in to buy breaker for its Twitter space
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.160]   And I think it's it's it's audio is the next thing right?
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   It's it's having audio chat audio Twitter. What's what's that other? What's that? What's that country club? How's called?
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:36.800]   Clubhouse that's what it was club. So that's the things I think they want help with their Twitter spaces
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.360]   I don't I think audio is the audio space is the
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.440]   I'm trying to do it. What Stacy did a bit ago
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.960]   Wait, you got wave your arms boy. This is the AR audio
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.480]   Really people the AR he said I think he's is this my contrails of the technology?
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.960]   Camitrails. Thank you. I was trying to
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.720]   That's it
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.840]   Contrails Kim trails are real. Yes
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.440]   We know what you're getting at I was not going to correct her
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.640]   No, no, you should you should I don't want to mess things up. I do worry because I I
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.880]   Just was looking at my
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.880]   Wi-Fi stuff. I have 70 different
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   devices on my Wi-Fi
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.760]   There's a there's a wow. Yeah, I only have 30 pretty normal though. Well, I think it probably is
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.840]   That's pretty normal with everybody
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:37.640]   There's at least five people in a household nowadays everybody has some sort of phone
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:43.320]   Everybody has some sort of laptop everybody has some sort of tablet and then you start to get all these other smart things that
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.000]   That number jumps up pretty that got 70 71 clients
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.160]   TVs everybody's got all sorts of stuff now what I did do what we were talking about
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.520]   Let's try to segment the Comcast. I'm gonna give you a piece of data
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.440]   Comcast says there's an average
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:06.480]   About 12 devices in people's homes and their power users connect up to 50 devices
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.880]   I'm a superpower user there it is. I just want to give you some data there. I would explain it
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.880]   You want to see the map?
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   This is the map
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:26.360]   That's that's trippy look at windows do anything for it. There's the there's the map of all the devices and the switches and
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.080]   the routers and the hubs
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.440]   Multiplying oh my god
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.000]   Apple can't handle your your displays no there's something going on there
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.520]   So but I did Stacy I did do the segmentation
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:46.360]   I actually there were so many IOT devices that I decided okay, you guys can have the network
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:56.840]   Network that's just secure because there's only like six computers and phones and things almost all of those 71 devices are IOT
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:05.400]   Hold on. I have this guy. I'm gonna give you guys a freebie his name on YouTube is the hookup
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.680]   the hookup it's terrible terrible but
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.760]   He has a video that helps you set up your ubiquity
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:17.880]   System. Oh good. It's called setup IOT VLANs and firewall rules with unify
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.560]   I I did it, but I would like I will watch it to see if I did anything wrong one thing
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:28.920]   I found and I doubt he'll he'll address this is there are devices that have to be on the same network the sonos
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.360]   Oh, so he shows how to do that and that's why he was my favorite. Oh, I'll watch it
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.440]   printers printers most of my printer so I set up a firewall rule that says
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:45.000]   Traffic can go from the secure network to the IOT network so we can control them but not back because I don't want any
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.760]   Any you know that makes a traffic from my IOT network out of my secure network, but things like printers need two-way traffic
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:58.000]   So I what's gonna end up happening. I know this is gonna have having I had to put all the printers onto the secure network
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.560]   I had to put the sonos is on a secure network
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   Everything's on the secure network
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:08.320]   Now this segmentation is not gonna work, but I will watch no I will watch that video and see
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.800]   At least the June oven is on its own network. I
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.760]   Don't need to control that that's
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.560]   Thank you Stacy. She just put the link in the show notes. I will I will be watching that
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:26.920]   Doorbell is that your doorbell or my doorbell? That's yours. No, it's my doorbell and my dog just ignore that
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.880]   The ubiquitous are great by the way for all of that. I have to say I've been very happy
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.880]   With that setup
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.800]   Oh while you're going to get go go get the door. I will do the next I will do it
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.440]   You need to go anywhere and you want to go anywhere now's the time. This is it
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.320]   Normally I would go and refuel but I can just turn to my left. You're gonna have some more of that sweet tea
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.800]   Yes, sir, please and thank you. It's not sweet tea. I know I don't fool you can't get a kitter
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.720]   I showed him brought you that's not sweet tea
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.680]   They brought you by

[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.600]   100 000 streams and I was like
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:36.000]   It's gonna blow cotton has got a blow a million concurrent users. It can also ingest thousands of synchronous streams
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.960]   They're reliable ingest platform is designed for transmuxing thousands of streams
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.520]   Simultaneously with live failover
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:53.680]   RTMP RT M FPS SRT whatever it is and deliver low latency sldp and hls streams at the same time
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.800]   Even better you can get a solution tailored exactly to your needs get a custom built solution

[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.880]   Uh
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.720]   Even when I we first started doing this the idea of doing this live
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.080]   Was pretty you know crazy, you know when if you get a insane it's insane
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:57.200]   Uh the cost structure is up to do that. I don't know what I was stupid
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.840]   That's why this cost structure is completely upside down with with you know radio or tv
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:07.360]   You build a transmitter and then if a million people watch it or one person watches it it costs the same it doesn't matter
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.320]   But that's the exact opposite of streaming the more people take you stream the more it costs you
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.400]   It's uh, it's it's a leo did you start the same year as youtube
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.520]   to the
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.920]   Yeah, but we weren't doing live streaming then but I was probably somewhat of an influence on us. Yeah
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.520]   Uh, well, but but also everybody said at the time youtube was insane. Google was insane
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.080]   It just doesn't scale right. Yeah
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.920]   And you went and did it
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.680]   Um, I don't know what I was thinking
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:41.520]   It's worked out all right now. We got the new tricaster and it's kind of like a whoo new tricaster
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.560]   Yeah, you like that you in playing with it, haven't you you're getting trained on it?
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:51.360]   It's quite nice quite nice. Not granted. There's a lot of stuff in there that we don't necessarily need but man that thing is pretty
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.040]   Bad ass. I'll just say that just john wanna show anything off right now. I don't know. Do you have anything set up?
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.120]   There's all no there's all sorts of there's virtual sets green screens. There's all sorts of
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:07.760]   Interesting stuff. One of the things where we want we are going to start to play with you know, normally you can see i've got my laptop hooked up
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:12.800]   I have to get a video out of it that goes into a converter
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.280]   I actually this has changed remarkably when we first started doing a tech tv
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.240]   the only good way we could get a screen
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.880]   On camera was to actually have a dedicated camera camera camera to it
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:31.440]   We put it on a big on a tv because it was crt's back then and the camera operator had a famous camera at it
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.640]   And you had to pull the focus just right so you didn't get more away from the screen
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.440]   And that's how we shot screens and if you wanted to zoom in the camera
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.800]   That's why I have an operator you could zoom in pan on the screen
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:46.960]   But by the time we started doing this 15 years ago, you could get a scan converter that you'd plug the thing into
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.360]   But in the early days of that it was real tricksy, you know, you had a
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.400]   the frame rate and refresh and all that stuff where had to be just right and then
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.080]   Now I just put a little driver on the mac
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:09.200]   and connect it to the internet and using ndi the ndi yeah network just is a distribution interface digital network digital
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.280]   It just goes into the I don't have to have a scan converter. It just goes into the board
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:19.520]   Oh, it has an ndi scan converter is it a bit of hardware or software only it's software
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.280]   So it's really I mean things have changed quite a bit. It's uh
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:29.920]   And by the way jumping the shark says we need instant replay and what is that little button on this on the thing there?
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.440]   There's an instant replay button. It is instant replay, sir
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.640]   It is
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.200]   Wait, wait, we can do that now. Can we do that? Uh, no, no, no, we're not a lot of this stuff. We haven't set up
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.360]   He has to we have to set the recording going but but I thought it'd be useful for me and Jeff
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.840]   I'll just press buttons all day. I thought it'd be useful for me and Jeff
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.440]   I could say no Jeff you didn't say that let's roll the tape
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.920]   Don't say the tape check the tape
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.720]   Oh, why don't we have this? I know
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.840]   Oh, yo
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.200]   Pig news

[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.240]   um
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:54.080]   He's current it was vice president of infrastructure and security at the chan zuckerberg initiative

[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.240]   What else what else what else

[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:29.200]   So ant i'm sure you'd be proud proud to know that the that the run of two of the musical not only erred
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.160]   But it raised a million dollars. Oh, it raised a ton of money. Yes
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.800]   Right. That's a musical. This would be your favorite part
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.920]   It went away
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:44.640]   Is it too lazy? I'm gonna roll my eyes for half a second because it is it is done and over with thank you very much
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.240]   Oh, well, it may be it may be done and but it's not
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.920]   Exactly over with
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.800]   Let me just say they wouldn't screen it after
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   Oh
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.280]   She claimed it was hers
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.640]   Okay, it's a wow
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:17.760]   Keep going. It's great. He takes he takes little bits of drama in social media and turns it into songs
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.160]   This is a new hot thing on tiktok lubolin
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.080]   social media drama converted to music
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.240]   I
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.600]   So he's reading tweets
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.320]   She's told my broccoli casserole recipe
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.160]   I love it. Okay
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.560]   It was created
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.720]   Although there it is a a kind of long standing tradition to do
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.280]   comical readings of tweets, isn't it?
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.440]   Who was it had hate tweets they bring the tweets jimmy kimmel yeah jimmy kimmel meme tweets. Yeah
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.480]   Twitter did you mention this when you were talking about audio twitter buying breaker
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.440]   Yes, we were trying to that but we needed your why we ever finished a question of why
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:11.040]   It's a I don't know it's a social podcasting app called breaker
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:17.520]   Oh, that's because you said it was the AR of so jeff was like I don't think basically jeff is like I don't think
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:25.040]   This audio is the big deal. I think so I think audio chat interesting. Yeah, I think that's really interesting
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.600]   It's it's it's I don't know if it's for me. There's some there's another service out there
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.200]   I think it's called polo or something like that and this is what it reminded me of is you given
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.760]   people the ability to connect using audio instead of text when
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.520]   Just picking up the phone and calling what do you just as good
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.200]   I just don't quite get that the only
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.480]   the only slant I can add to this is
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.080]   The cto of breaker is the wonderful lea kover who
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:05.840]   Co-authored oauth and o embed and she was involved in pounce, which was a twitter clone that I really liked
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.560]   She's very cool kevin rose, right?
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.640]   Uh, yeah rose involved and yeah, he was involved and uh, so
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.680]   I'm really happy for lea
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.720]   But yeah, I don't know it'll be interesting
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   Uh lea will be joining twitter with a focus on twitter spaces
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.600]   Which is their audio based?
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.360]   Social networking product. It's kind of like clubhouse
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:36.000]   Um, I think I think the kids I think honestly jeff it's not for you and me, but I think the young's like it
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:43.200]   I actually think it's people like our generation. Yeah old folks kids hate talking on this stuff
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:50.240]   That's what I heard was our age group was in clubhouse. Yeah, it's people who like to hear themselves talk
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.040]   Uh, so that's exactly why I am not a member
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.600]   I don't want to hear anybody else talk
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:04.480]   Anyway, so yeah, that's that's good news. They'll shut down for good
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120]   uh, january 15th
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.080]   Uh, and if you are a breaker user run over there and export your opm l file
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.520]   So you can transfer your subscriptions to another podcasting app
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.320]   um interesting
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.640]   Interesting. Yeah
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.400]   I think you know twitter twitter has a history of doing this kind of thing and not necessarily remember vine
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.960]   not necessarily being able to uh
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.760]   Manifest they just shut down periscope shut down periscope last week, right?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   But I think they're smart to
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.200]   You play with different things
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.600]   Uh, they can afford it, right?
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   um
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   Verifications coming back on the 20th
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.800]   You could try to get verified
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.200]   Are you still verified or is you quit?
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.440]   I'm blue checked. I'm blue. I'm gonna try
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.880]   Yeah, I probably don't have to try it now, but at one point it was a lot of people tweeting other ant periwits confusing them
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.680]   Oh, it's always good to get the blue check. Oh, yeah
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.680]   Yeah
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:11.040]   Always nice. I never actually I think twitter reached out because I was at giga. Oh, and I got yeah, you were a giga
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.040]   That's probably why right?
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040]   Yeah
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.840]   Yep, I was with a more famous publication
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.000]   I don't know what was that
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.160]   Where did that come from?
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.600]   I think it was any ugly if i'm not mistaken
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.160]   That was that was my dad on a bomb just again. Okay, say no
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.160]   Mm
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.840]   How does lio loport's brain work?
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:46.480]   Uh, it doesn't so here is if you want to use your brain an article that a number of people have referred to
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.120]   from birt hub
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.040]   dot you
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.440]   It is reverse engineering the source code. Yes source code of the Pfizer
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.880]   covid vaccine and it is
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.240]   I highly recommend it. It is fascinating
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.320]   Why do you understand any of it? Yeah
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.640]   Wait, why does the vaccine have a source code? That's what's fascinating
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.120]   Okay
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.920]   Because uh most vaccines are deactivated
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.960]   Up till now vaccines are basically deactivated
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.440]   Viruses that you you know like the salt vaccine that you inject
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.680]   And then your body not knowing it's a deactivated virus is not a threat
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.160]   It's dead, but their body creates the antidote antibodies for that virus
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.080]   You know to repel it but that's but the mr
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.680]   N a is much more interesting much more sophisticated
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.160]   and uh
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.160]   The way it's what's really interesting is
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.560]   very early on
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.720]   The virus was sequenced you sequenced you remember remember this back in january
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.600]   that the the genome of the virus was released publicly
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.120]   And it only took a week or two. I remember we did the story
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.600]   for a couple of companies to create the vaccine
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.120]   based on the genome
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.560]   Knowing that you know, the way an mr
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   N a vaccine uh works
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.480]   Is uh, it basically is instructions to create
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.520]   the antibody that are injected into your body
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.240]   and um
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:20.960]   so
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.040]   Having the genome they could fairly quickly within a few days
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:31.920]   Design the vaccine all of the time from january till now was testing was yeah
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.040]   It was instantaneous. Yeah, it was almost instantaneous
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:40.880]   Thompson has a been Thompson has a very interesting article on strateccary saying that that's a that shouldn't take that long
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   We should have gone immediately to things like human challenge trials, which are dangerous
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.560]   Uh because of the dis desperate need for this vaccine. We should have taken a riskier
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   Yeah, right. We should have taken a
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.600]   Well, hovid person breathe on you
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:01.680]   As it turns out if we had done that we would have the vaccine a lot earlier, but if on the other hand it was a dangerous
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.480]   Vaccine that killed people. Well, it wouldn't have been quite such a good result
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:12.160]   so the the bnt 162 b2 m rna vaccine
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.720]   code
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.240]   Is published in this blog post it's 4,284 characters
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.840]   In other words, it would fit in about 10 tweets or 20 tweets
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:28.640]   Somebody at the very beginning of the production process uploaded this code to a get this
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.200]   dna printer
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.840]   Which converted the bites on the disc to actual dna molecules
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.440]   Out of the machine came is in this amazing came tiny amounts of dna
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.640]   Which are which after a lot of biological and chemical
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.240]   Processing end up as rna in the vaccine vial
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   A 30 microgram dose turns out to actually contain 30 micrograms of rna
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.280]   It's entirely rna and then there's a
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.320]   Lipid packaging system that gets the messenger rna into our cells
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:09.040]   Um, so it's it's very much like a computer program being injected into your veins
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.960]   And the rna then instructs
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160]   the cells to create
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.000]   Uh, this, I guess analog of the virus
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.560]   So anyway, if you're interested, I think Stacy you'd really you'd really dig this article
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.640]   Um
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.520]   I will read it
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.240]   The idea of a vaccine is to teach our immune system how to fight a pathogen without actually getting sick
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.920]   Historically, it's been done by injecting a weekend or in capacitated virus
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.480]   Plus an adjuvant to scare our immune system into action. That's why it used chicken eggs
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.680]   To make it and it took a lot of time
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:54.320]   The m rna vaccine does the same thing educate our immune system, but in a laser-like way
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.400]   The injection contains volatile genetic material that describes the spike protein on the cove
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.440]   SARS cove two
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.040]   Uh virus
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.240]   The vaccine manages to get this genetic material into our cells, which then start producing
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.480]   SARS cove two spike proteins and large enough quantities that our immune system says whoa hold on
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.040]   leaps into action
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.080]   They're really not the virus. They're just the spike proteins
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.920]   But the immune system develops a powerful response against multiple aspects of the spike protein
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.040]   And you are protected
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.560]   And 95 protected so it's a fascinating story
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:43.600]   It really is for people interested in digital technology. The analog is very close. It's very very interesting
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.640]   Okay, okay. So let's let's let's switch into moral panic mode. What could go wrong with this?
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:55.200]   Well, you could stimulate a result you didn't you know a reaction you didn't want you could you're just like any other
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.960]   issue of going
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.360]   Too narrow, right? So you're training your mode training your immune system on it the exact protein and then the or the exact spike pattern
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.640]   I'm asking the hands of a bad act the virus evolves a bad actor. Oh
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.840]   Well, you could create
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.040]   I mean
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.280]   We already have synthetic viruses out there
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.120]   Yeah, I mean one of the things that kills you in some of in these uh
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.880]   In these respiratory infections is a is a cytokine storm an overreaction
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.760]   Of the immune system. So I mentioned that would be one thing you could do is trigger
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.480]   An immune reaction that is fatal
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.760]   um, but honestly, I think
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.600]   That was kind of bentoms since part of bentoms point was that these mr. And a
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.240]   viruses are not
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.360]   Really that danger not compared to other kinds of vaccines
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   And so the concern of like an overreaction. Yes. Yeah
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.360]   So that maybe it would have been appropriate for us to
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.080]   literally fast track it
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   Um, so that we could have had
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.440]   You know this vaccine six months ago, but not everyone was doing an mr. And a vent vaccine
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.880]   That's I mean, so do you change the rules and the other thing is the mr. And a mr. And a vaccines
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:15.040]   Were so poo pooed by the established. Oh, yeah for decades. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that you know
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.640]   It's easy to look back and say oh, this is so safe. We totally should have done it differently, right?
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.320]   but
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.160]   and
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   And you could argue that
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.320]   We were at such risk. I'm sorry the dog is going to keep going because there are people working outside
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:38.080]   But we were told the dog that that person is doing god's good for you. It's good stuff. It's very important work
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.480]   That person is a friend. I was like
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.960]   So you'll be on the internet more
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480]   Cats on the internet doggy cats
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.960]   Um
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.600]   Hey, here's a good news. I forgot to make my point. Oh, make your point. I'm sorry. I forgot it. I was like dog dog
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.080]   point dog
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.440]   m rna
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:11.760]   In hindsight, it's easy to say now. No, no, no, no, and it isn't dangerous that we should have done it quicker
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.200]   Right, that was what you were starting to say
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:22.640]   Yes, and the question the the rest of that I don't remember doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.880]   blame the fiber blame the fiber
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.320]   Good news book publishers. Hey, maybe jeff you should write a book
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:36.240]   Thanks to man. I'm trying thanks to covet business was better than ever yes
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.680]   For hardcover real dead tree books
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.960]   No, yes, I guess because maybe people bought them they didn't want to go to the library
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.040]   You had all this time so you were like during my pandemic. I will get so small. I will also
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.760]   People reading more for sure right I read more print sales up 8%
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.480]   however
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.160]   audiobook sales up 17% year over year
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.600]   Which is a more about commuting and stuff. It's not
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.960]   No, and and e-book sales which have been declining, you know that whole ebook revolution turned out not to happen
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.320]   It's the ar pretty yes, they are
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.040]   But actually but last year even e-book sales are up 16%
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.760]   Yeah, I thought you put all this back my editor. I like e-books too, you know, I
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.160]   Well, for instance, I'm reading a marvelous science fiction trilogy right now
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.040]   Which went oh if you haven't read do you know peter f hamilton, do you know his work?
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.800]   Oh, he's I think one of the one of the great science fiction writers alive working right now
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.600]   Uh read fallen dragon. That's a single volume one a really nice one to start fallen dragon by peter f hamilton
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.440]   But his most recent series is the salvation trilogy
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.360]   Sequence yeah, it's a trilogy, but it's called a salvation sequence, but it's really good, but
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.720]   there are a lot of
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.920]   Weird names and words
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.400]   for instance, uh, there is a race
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:17.840]   Of genetically modified people that cycle between male and female and so they have to have a pronoun for these
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.640]   people and so it's instead of
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.120]   Him or her it's h i r
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:30.480]   Instead of he or she it's s i e and when they read the audiobook it's here and see but it's not clear
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.360]   Well, what are you wait? So you have to read it and then it's kind of all makes sense
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.200]   So I ended up buying motes and god moton god's i'd read fantastic fantastic
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.480]   So
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:48.160]   But having I like the audiobook, but I also want to see the text and so the whisper sync with the kindle and uh an audio is really great
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.040]   And and it keeps track of where you are so you could pick it up as you go. So I actually
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.640]   Uh, I have been buying more ebooks this year. So i'm one of the people that
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.480]   Help the books increase 16 percent this past year
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.600]   Been buying a lot of my editors said they they kind of pulled some stuff back to see how it was going to go
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.960]   And then and then saw it was going to write and push back in isn't that interesting
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.480]   No
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:16.560]   Um people were bored like you said and then there are some people that were inspired because of the additional free time from
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.400]   Not having to commute and things like that. There's another thing at work
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:27.440]   Uh, and it certainly happened in podcast where because of the political climate and and covid and black lives matter
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.920]   A lot of people went and got books about those subjects the history. Yeah, so trump political books
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.840]   So well
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.080]   No, no books about race relations uh sold really really well
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.000]   Um bookstores had according to the new york times had trouble keeping
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.880]   How to be an anti-racist by kendy or so you want to talk about race by uh, allu in stock
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.120]   books about uh, the president trump have performed particularly well
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.840]   Um the marry trump uh book sold more than a 1.35 million copies in its first right
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:08.000]   I have been loving by the way if you want a great audiobook president obama's a promised land. He reads it
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.160]   It's in his voice. It's a it's a really personal memoir of his
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.840]   Uh life the his presidency. I I think it's one of it's a just fascinating book
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.840]   That sold 3.3 million copies in the last month
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.960]   Um, it's really good. I'm not surprised
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.160]   And it's been a bestseller around the world too actually
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.240]   The only audiobook I have enjoyed there were two one was Trevor Noah's
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:40.320]   Uh, yeah, that's pretty good because he does all that he does all the accents and that's way better. Yeah. Thank you born a crime
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   I was like something about crimes
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.840]   um, and then
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.800]   Americana by i'm gonna screw name up
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.600]   It's a fiction book though
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.560]   um, but his story of a Nigerian immigrant and it's all about
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.120]   race and
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.120]   Not just in the us but primarily in the us but a lot of it depends on the accents of the people who are speaking
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.800]   And the actress who does who reads the book does all of that's where audiobooks are selling don't they?
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.360]   That's really where they can be fantastic
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:15.760]   Sometimes they call those full cast productions where uh, they use this is the scene. This was a single one
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.240]   Gator readers. Yes a good readers really good, but there are also these fabulous full cast
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.840]   Production, you know my favorite. It was one of my favorite novels. I don't think it was last year. There was two years ago
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.320]   Um, oh
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.200]   It was the one about uh, it was Lincoln and the barto. I don't know if you read that by George Sanders
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.680]   Yeah, everybody thought that was great. I loved it
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:39.840]   But you know what listen to the audiobook because every character in that has a different reader
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.480]   And so it's like listening to books
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.120]   You would like this one try it. Okay
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.000]   That's the only here's here's a here's a macho audio muk moment. I'm honestly needed
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.440]   Sagan
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:02.480]   The decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Oh sure 126 hours scribble scribble scribble scriber a mr. Gibbon
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:09.600]   Yes 126 hours. Should I do it? No, but you know what's good and I have been reading
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.560]   It's not quite as long as the rise and fall of the third Reich
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.480]   It's quite good
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:23.520]   Is there is there a reason I have another friend of mine did that is it a new recording? Um, I don't think so
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:28.800]   Twitter just removed the president's tweets. Oh, they were
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.440]   We tweets all of them. No, just two of the most recent ones
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:38.000]   So it's interesting how they're getting a spine now. Yeah
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.120]   Well, just like if you don't have it now, right? It's like, right? We're we're setting it
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.520]   They just took up the two fire this tweet is no longer available. This tweet is no longer available
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.240]   Did he did I guess one of them was the video?
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:58.640]   Yeah, one was the video. That was the last one and the one before that was he was saying hey, uh,
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.040]   Take care of the police
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.920]   Law enforcement something along those lines. Oh, I thought it was something about the fraud and the sacred election
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:11.440]   I was like the sacred and landslide election that was blatantly. Oh, I'm well. I must have missed that tweet
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.320]   It was so special
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.240]   It's amazing. What a world but I do think that's but that's why it was interesting the book sales were up
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.640]   I think some of it was because of covid 19
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.680]   But I think also some of it was people trying to understand black lives matter what's going on in DC
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:33.040]   There was there was a kind of a seeking out of something that maybe was a little bit more
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:40.080]   Thoughtful reliable detailed than just the day-to-day reporting we're getting and I think that's actually true and I
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.040]   Think that's encouraging. Yeah, I think it's really encouraging
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.440]   Plus their experiment with the form right john ronson did his great butterfly effect thing
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:51.920]   Which was about you know the impact of free porn on all these yeah, I remember that both
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:57.200]   I just listened to unquiet my life with Beethoven. Oh, I don't listen to this
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:05.760]   Uh, so it's an audible original jonathan biss who's a concert pianist who talks through from covid on
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:11.280]   His anxiety about his decision in life to record all the Beethoven sonatas
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.320]   And then you hear pieces of them obviously and so it's really very good as the only
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.640]   podcast the only audiobook I listened to recently on one donno speed
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:27.600]   Now see i'm in the audio book right now that uh, it's a book that i've had it for a couple years
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.440]   I just never really got around to it and I fired it up last week
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.080]   And i'm halfway through it and it's talking about
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.720]   A snowstorm that's just really wiped out a big part of new york city
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:45.920]   Uh a threat to the infrastructure. There's quarantine going on and his book was from
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   October night october 29 2013 is called cyberstorm and i'm reading this now and i'm thinking
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.960]   Wow
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.280]   So
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.520]   Yeah, we we we appreciate that book. We recommended it a couple of years ago
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.800]   Yeah, I had it a little while ago and never cracked it open and finally cracked it open last week
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.760]   Also a little bit of a reflection on little chilling
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.080]   how poorly the day-to-day media has done explaining and
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.280]   Helping people understand what's going on
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.400]   Really good. They know
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.520]   I think part of it is if you're seeking the media is not super diverse
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.200]   So I think if you're seeking actual authenticity and voices from people who are not just being explained
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:39.840]   By like others. I think books are really your only option because the media has done such a bad job. Okay
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:46.000]   That's the same then we agree. It's just another reason right to go deeper than what we were getting. Okay
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.600]   if
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.280]   The media is not
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.480]   Diverse if you will
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:53.200]   Uh is that because of the leadership
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   Should we start there because i'm sure a lot of these anchors that are on the screens trying to present this information to the masses
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.360]   A lot of times they disagree with what's being whispered in their IEM saying
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.720]   Hey, we need to make sure we hit this point that point so on and so forth
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.800]   but because of the way
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.040]   News is today and everything is sort of sensationalized for the clicks in for the views
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.560]   the
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.520]   It's just a big old freaking mess if nobody can trust it
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:24.720]   I think there's a lot of there's a dearth of voices because
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   for a long time to make it in the media industry you had to have money
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.400]   and
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.800]   You had to have money because you had to know paying in like no paid internships
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.480]   um, so
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:43.040]   You know, you had to be willing to work for free or very little for and then there's also discrimination in the newsroom
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:49.840]   Um, I sat in a news meeting at fortune. I one of my jobs was every morning. We had a meeting
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:57.200]   Um to talk about what we're going to run that day and working on and the entire white male editor
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.960]   The the top editors there was one woman
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:09.520]   They were like, what's micro aggressions and then they proceeded to make fun of the concept of micro aggressions while every single person
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.040]   Like all the youngest staffers were just like
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:19.440]   I think the thing to remember is that media is no different than just corporate america
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.560]   It is corporate america. Yeah with scorper america with a camera and a microphone, but it's corporate america
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:31.040]   So it's it's prone to the same exact deals those things that you just described stacy are happening in every boardroom in america
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.080]   Amen and just it's the media is supposed to have a different it's supposed to but it doesn't it doesn't
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:43.040]   Msmbc is owned by mbc, which is owned by comcast. I mean, it's it's yes
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.280]   It's all corporate right it's corporate america with a microphone and a camera. So why would you expect it to be any different?
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.360]   I've tried to tell my family life experience that too. Yeah
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.360]   Yes, you'd expect reporters to have a little bit more life experience, but why don't think you're right?
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.600]   I don't know you all the higher white reporters. You're not so there's a wonderful wonderful book
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:11.200]   I recommend by lewis raven wallace who's a transgender journalist who was an npr who got fired from npr because he wouldn't
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.800]   um
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.280]   High to their standard of objectivity
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:22.160]   And and he was always told or you can't cover that story about about trans or gender issues because because you're biased
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.400]   Because you're trans and
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.680]   Because you know something about it. Yeah, exactly versus white people covering white people because you know can do that
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.120]   That's that's that's that's that's that's normal right in their definition
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.560]   and
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:40.080]   You know what he makes an eloquent point about about how you've just rejected the lived experience
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.440]   That would help your cover you've devalued it down to nothing so that your coverage has none of this now
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:51.600]   And uh, and I don't know we talked about this in the show before but but also I'd recommend to anybody interested in this
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:58.960]   Wesley larry who was a Pulitzer prize winning washington post reporter covering the police killings of people
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.600]   um
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:05.760]   Who left the post because he got an argument with marty baron over his tweets
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.440]   Then he wrote a an op-head about three months ago in the new york times that objectivity is
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.600]   Fundamentally racist because it is people look like me old white men who decide what is objective?
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.560]   They decide what is bias. They decide what is normal
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.480]   And and that whole structure is systematically biased
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.040]   And they decide what's interesting so I have put things in my stories
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.680]   that also like
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:37.440]   When I use she as my pronouns for people who like just like
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:45.680]   If i'm talking about the user when when she does this right they get that he is the default right and he did when I talk about
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.640]   Oh, yeah, and I mean, I've been doing this a long time. Jeff 20 years. They might not do it today
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   That's for occasion, but
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   And then there's things like just just a few months ago my IEEE editor. I had stuck something in my story
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.960]   It was about domestic violence actually in the smart home and it wasn't not an aside
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.960]   but it was a small paragraph and
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.360]   You know, he was like, oh, I don't know if our readers really want to hear about this
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.280]   And I was like they may not want to but they totally should and I think that's about to
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.840]   And he was like that's a really good point. I'll bring that up and one of the reasons
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.640]   IEEE hired me to do this column is because all of
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.320]   Up until that point all of their columnists were really old white men
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.480]   Now they've got a semi old white woman. It's sort of
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.120]   To answer your question to aunt
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.160]   With more depressing data here
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:45.840]   Um, the newspaper association or the whatever it's called. They changed the name all the time. Yeah, and la. I think these people are something or other
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.400]   yeah
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.640]   they uh
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.640]   the newspapers won't even
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.040]   Answer the surveys
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.880]   Of the diverse numbers in their newsrooms and numbers is the least of it right that's not
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:06.240]   Inclusion that's not equity just how many they're so embarrassed after all these generations of having made no progress
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.160]   They won't even fill out the survey for the industry. That's not bad. We are
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.840]   I'm not even looking at it from a race standpoint. I'm looking at it from the standpoint of
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.840]   You have to look at all of the different point of views if there's a story about
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.920]   A football team. I don't know just some random football team check
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:29.040]   With different sources and I try to tell my family and particularly with my boys
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:35.360]   Uh, you can check other sources for this information. Don't just depend upon ABC or NBC
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.520]   Don't just depend upon me because sometimes i'm going to shoot you a bunch of bull crap
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.600]   Just to make you look it up and verify
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.480]   You know, so just just check all of the sources
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   Uh
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:51.680]   Let's do a little google change log in just a bit
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.880]   I want to reintroduce our fine panelists
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:02.320]   Stacey higgin botham stacey on iot her newsletter is free. There is absolutely no reason not to subscribe to it
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.200]   That's not a very positive way to quit
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.320]   Wow
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.320]   Not
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.880]   So, you know, you might have no no reason you shouldn't be getting it
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:23.520]   No, you must get it. You must get it. It's wonderful. Stay. I'm just teasing. She's gonna. I'm glad you picked up on that
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.280]   Stacey on iot

[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.120]   No, I don't know about that. That has a different connotation
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.000]   Really?
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.240]   Sorry
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.240]   We
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:10.400]   Uh, and now it's time for the google change log
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.440]   google change log
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.360]   D-d-d-d-d
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:24.640]   Finally smart comments google has added smart compose and autocorrect to comments
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.800]   This is how this is how sparse our change log is this week
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.680]   It is pathetic
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:36.320]   It's just january. It's just january. By the way, I slagged
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.280]   Google on mac break weekly yesterday
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:45.200]   For not I I repeated the fast company story that google hadn't updated any of its apps
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.520]   since mid-December
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.400]   Because if they knew that the apple rule was if they did I think it was after December 6th
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.280]   They would have to include the privacy nutrition
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:59.120]   Statement and be subject to the privacy, you know, yes
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.240]   No questions that apple does to all for all iOS apps and google didn't want to do that
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.800]   uh, but that was
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:15.360]   Calumne because in fact as it turns out google like many companies doesn't release new products during the holiday period because they don't
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:21.760]   Want showstoppers bringing their employees back from their nice holiday so they google said no no no
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.480]   We're gonna we got all the updates we're gonna put them out the next week or two
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.680]   And yes, of course we're gonna adhere to all the apple privacy rules
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.680]   So apologies google
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.520]   That was that was not not a fair commentary
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:37.600]   Google's releasing a monitoring query language for cloud monitoring
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.760]   No
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.480]   I put that in there
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.640]   Can even you find something interesting to this one
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.000]   No
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.200]   Where os remember that remember there used to be this thing
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:01.040]   Was it called an android where watch that had google android where operating system remember that remember that the one that
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.880]   Only just told the
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:08.320]   Just barely it just never it got so slaughtered by apple in the marketplace
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.480]   The even google was embarrassed to admit that it exists. It's the ar of time
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:20.960]   Everything's gonna be from now on it's gonna be the ar of uh, where os is about to gain support for
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.640]   tiles third party tiles
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:31.920]   Did we say that the eat did we ever talk about the EU approving the fit bit deal? That's not really a change
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:38.320]   No, that's good. So google is that the last hurdle the google acquiring fit bit
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.200]   I believe it might
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.040]   Yeah, right. Yeah, it's like who knows with an incoming
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.600]   Google podcasts web client adds simple subscriptions feed
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:54.320]   Is this is the worst change log ever
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:33:00.400]   January update for the pixel 5 4a and 5g
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:06.240]   Improves auto brightness and stop the prices auto rotate
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:13.280]   I hope it improves the touchscreen functionality if you have a screen protector on
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:18.320]   Oh, yeah, but so that's something sam-sung does they have a setting in the settings it says
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.720]   Increase sensitivity because i've got a screen protector on there. They I guess google never put that in they should put that in
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:32.160]   And that happens this month and now for those of you who like to hold up your laptop and scan qr codes
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:36.800]   There is now a qr scanner in the chromo s camera app
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:44.000]   Is that you mr. Jarvis would you ever do that you'd never scan a qr code with your laptop
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.240]   I can't figure out how to do it on my phone
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.920]   And that of all things is the worst google changelog ever
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:01.120]   It does not deserve drums. It does not deserve the drums. Don't know crickets
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.360]   It deserved a bongo. We should mention that sam-sung apago
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:11.440]   Hey, man. Hey, let's do that. It's it's time for the google changelog
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.480]   Did you state our theme song I did we're back to the silly flutes
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:23.600]   So this is i'm looking this is january 6th
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.600]   uh
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.360]   a week
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360]   from tomorrow
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.600]   When's a thursday january 14th?
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.400]   7 a.m. Pacific 10 a.m. eastern sam-sung will announce the new galaxy s 21
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.120]   And uh, it is a little early for us 7 a.m
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.080]   So i'm not gonna get up, but i'm gonna make Jason howl and company
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.560]   Uh cover that sam-sung apact event we will stream it. How have at it?
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:51.280]   Have an place of android fella
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.240]   Yeah, that's right. You want to be our android expert you get to get up and uh
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.360]   And watch the big sam-sung galaxy unpacked event
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.040]   um
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.040]   judges in the uk has
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.520]   Prohibited the extradition of julian assage to the united states where he's charged with uh, espionage
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.080]   under the espionage act the judge said that
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.480]   Assage was under it was at extreme risk of suicide
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:26.960]   And so yeah if he came to the u.s. Yes, so you can't have
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.800]   Uh that had been used in another case recently so I think they happened upon that
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:39.360]   I don't know what the word is defense but argument but uh, but but because he spent six years in the equatorian embassy
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:43.200]   He lost out on getting bail. Uh does he say
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.880]   So does that mean he will stay in prison in the uk?
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.240]   Just stay in prison. Yep in the uk until the appeal. That's fine
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.560]   um
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.680]   Mostly
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.760]   The charge is kind of bogus in the u.s
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:56.480]   He
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:02.000]   If found guilty on our accounts he could face up to 175 years in prison, but mostly what it looks like he did is
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.280]   Encourage somebody to hack the dnc in a chat room conversation
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:14.560]   He didn't like actually hack it. He's he's a jerk of jerks and everyone has worked with him. We'll say that but but he didn't go on twitter
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.520]   And inside a riot in the u.s. Capitol
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.160]   That's legal if you're president
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:27.520]   Uh, he didn't he didn't have his have his kid. Uh, try to use a can opener to open a can of beans
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.400]   I mean that's oh wait a minute. We're not talking about being dead being dead. No, I refuse
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.080]   be dead
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.520]   First of all
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:39.680]   John roderick we know john roderick. He does a podcast with mr. L. Mm.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:47.680]   I don't know him personally, but a lot of people I know like marco armit and jonathan colton judge john hodgman
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.240]   and of course mr. L. Mm. Mm.
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:53.200]   Say he's you know he's a comedian
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:57.040]   And that whole bean rant which I never read
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.320]   About not letting his daughter eat until she learned how to use a can opener to open a can of beans
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.560]   Was intended as comedy. He also has some earlier tweets that are
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.960]   anti semitic and weird but again
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.920]   intended as sarcastic comedy and as you said
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.000]   Stacey in some situations sarcasm plays poorly
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.240]   um
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.480]   But there were there were a few threads that I thought were very good and informative about
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.080]   um
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.120]   People who've gone through abusive parental relationships
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.760]   Exactly he did not understand to be had here. Yeah, and he took that lesson
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.800]   He apologized profusely and killed his twitter account
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.160]   This is this is you know, this is why no one should ever have a twitter account ever
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.600]   I'm just saying
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.320]   uh
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.680]   is jack ma
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.360]   Has he been disappeared or is he just lying low?
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:57.840]   We don't know we don't know the founder of uh ali baba and probably the richest man in china
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:00.960]   hasn't been seen
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.960]   in uh many weeks
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.760]   There was another
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:11.120]   Was it there another uh high paid or rich person in china that's been missing as well
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.120]   I think this is him ruke right
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:19.360]   Oh, yes, some other billionaires might have disappeared he was very critical of the regime now according to cnbc
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:25.520]   He has been found he is not missing. He is merely lying low. Oh, okay
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:31.360]   Enjoying his money. Yeah, no, I think it's his government's been like
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.240]   By low and he's like got it. Yeah
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.480]   He was really pretty critical of the chinese regime which
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.040]   Even if you're the richest man in
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.520]   I don't know
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:51.760]   They're sensitive you can't even say that i mean looks like many of the poo so I you know they're sensitive
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:56.160]   Anyway, he's still the richest man in china for now
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.720]   Do you like open ais sketching abilities
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:05.280]   They're not terrible. Well, some of them aren't
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.920]   You know they're better than not my sketches would be
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:11.520]   Decide to build all this technology to have a radish walk-a-daw
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.640]   That's where we've come you wouldn't decide that. I mean
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:20.320]   This is stacy with a skirt tell me about this gpt3 thing. What is this?
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:26.960]   Oh the the artificial intelligence, that's the writing one, isn't it? Yeah, that's the one that's that's been writing
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:31.120]   News stories that are indistinguishable from actual
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.640]   Yeah
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.480]   Terrellists reports
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.760]   Um, it can write original passage passages of text given a short prompt
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:47.040]   Um, it's it's the game. I mean, it's a game. So it's it's a it's generative learning
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.400]   um
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.160]   Yeah, and
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.960]   Is that the one they didn't want us to release? They didn't open a I created it. Yeah, and they didn't want to release the source code
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.080]   or how it worked so
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.080]   and then the the
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.960]   We're still talking about the turnip
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.840]   Well, okay. So the so the turnip
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.200]   Is dale so now we're in a dangerous dolly
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.920]   After wally except it's also a play on salvador dolly
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.600]   Yeah, dolly get it. It's a it's a surrealist. It's a dadaist
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.480]   Play on a Pixar character
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.000]   What gpt3 is to language and generating words
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.840]   dolly
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:38.080]   Is to turning language into images? Yeah, and it's also a generative thing created by open AI
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:39.840]   um
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.680]   and
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:48.800]   Yeah, so this is this is where instead of writing a paragraph of text based on a prompt. It does a drawing based on a prompt
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.000]   This these
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.720]   Drawings are from the prompt a can of soup that has the word sky net on it
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.080]   Which is kind of funny all by itself
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:04.880]   And there it is there's a tab. It's a yeah, it's easy open. It's an easy open. It's a slurp that soup. Yep. Yep
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.160]   It can take unrelated concepts that are nothing alike and put them together into a functional
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.840]   Object says that's why you have the radish walking the dog. That's a functional. Oh, exactly. Yeah
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.800]   So what was the prompt on the radish walking the dog
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.760]   an illustration of a baby
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.720]   Dicon radish in a tutu
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:29.200]   walking a dog
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.200]   Well, that's it. I mean, that's pretty good
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.920]   And that so what's from from literal lines? What's well? What's remarkable about this is is
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.560]   Is these here three completely unrelated concepts?
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:45.120]   Dicon radish tutu walking a dog and it was able to synthesize those into an image
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.560]   That's impressive. I guess
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.720]   Got a present that I can imagine so yeah, think about kids do that all the time
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.280]   Well, yes
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.800]   My kid could do better than this computer and then of course we got them do a little 230 news
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.400]   Mike maznick all up in arms. He says and I didn't see it
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:14.400]   So I can't comment that the 60 minutes piece on section 230 was completely bogus and wrong
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.720]   Mazork was in fine form though fine moral panic you called it
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.600]   Fine fiddle. He said it. I didn't he said it. He said moral panic clear
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:31.920]   And then you have a piece in on your blogs also. I presume on medium speechless and allegory for our time
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.520]   with a new yorker cover from 2018
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.160]   Of a woman by my efforts. It's kind of jeff does sci-fi
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:43.440]   Oh, what is it? So this is a fiction imagine
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.000]   Yes, imagine a world where where 230 and other things have happened
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.600]   and
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.800]   So the character goes to see his editor
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:55.520]   And discovers that he has to pay
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.920]   To have a fact checker take out all the facts because nonfiction is too risky
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.200]   And pay for your speech insurance
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:09.360]   And that it costs more now to write than to read what it would be like without section 230
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:15.040]   Your post 230 dystopian novel buzz machine calm
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:22.320]   Uh, I think we can I mean I think we can safely say that section 230 is safe for the night for the time being in fact
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:27.440]   Some say because of the democrats win in georgia that maybe even net neutrality might come back
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.600]   that now that the democrats control the senate uh, president elect biden can nominate as
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.320]   candidates for
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.320]   For instance the chairman of the fcc that would be a little harder to get through a republican senate
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:46.480]   You say yeah, but the uh, say for the time being you mean as in just with 2021. It's safe for now
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.960]   Think it's going to take a little bit longer
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:53.040]   Well, it's no we don't have net neutrality right now the fcc overturned it two years ago
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:57.920]   So no, no, no, come back section 230 session. Okay. Yeah. I feel like
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.160]   the assaults on 230 were all kind of political posturing and none of them
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:05.680]   Uh, got enacted into law, right
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.960]   No, I'm very we're talking about net neutrality or section 230
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.040]   Oh 230 230 first. I I too now when we talk about 230
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:18.080]   230 okay, let's talk about edge of trolley. Okay
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.920]   I'm coming back. Okay
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:25.760]   Uh, well, I'm in other words. Well, we already saw it. Uh, it's just a rumor
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.840]   But the that marrick garland will be uh, uh, nominated for attorney general
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.960]   A candidate that would not have been nominated had the republicans continued control of the senate
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.880]   Because uh, biden would have to nominate somebody that would be more likely to get
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.040]   Past muster, plus this is too embarrassing to finally talk to the guy you wouldn't talk to
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.880]   Yeah, right
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.880]   But the the thinking is perhaps
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:53.600]   The same thing will happen with the chairman of the fcc and perhaps if if dave r cordon can convince
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.680]   uncle joe
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.800]   That net neutrality is a good thing. Maybe we can get makes a progress there
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:03.440]   I think I think biden does support net neutrality. I know he's kind of iffy on 230
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:05.680]   But I don't want to put stacey to sleep
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:10.880]   Oh, no, I just I I'm not my brain can't focus on
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.720]   230 is just I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I dumped it. Yeah
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:17.200]   Yeah, there's smart people who deal with that already
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:22.240]   I would say actually instead of dealing with net neutrality on its I think we should actually
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:29.120]   God help us revamp the communications act of 1996 that includes section 230
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:32.480]   By the way
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:35.680]   See you try this. I know
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:37.360]   I know
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.360]   I was trying to be honest to
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.480]   What we really need to do even if it sucks for me personally because of 230. Yeah
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.680]   But I do think that
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.760]   Okay, I'll read it. I mean I
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.720]   I know enough about it to know what it is and what it isn't
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:59.120]   I just don't want to think about it anymore. No, but I think must have been much of america has now been misinformed
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.520]   By that 60 minutes piece
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.480]   Which was factually just wrong because they don't care doesn't nobody cares. You're right. Just one day
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.920]   Yes, just us that care
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:15.920]   My piece is set in 29 when we have the next pandemic which I called blovid
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:23.840]   Well bid 29 nice. It sounds like a light beer
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:32.560]   All right, how can I put this in there? Oh, I was going to just say when we were talking about media and diversity actually
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.200]   Are you familiar with the 19th news?
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.880]   Down in texas great. They are spectacular. Okay. What is it? Just making sure
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:47.360]   It is you're Stacy you brought it up. Go ahead. Oh, it is it is a new publication
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.880]   It's a nonprofit
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.600]   Newsroom that's actually doing a lot of hiring right now if you are a woman in journalism
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.200]   Um from the point of oh, it's just for women first group of women. Well, no, it's women reporting the news
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:04.720]   Yes, and and and issues that matter to women and not the whole life doesn't
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:13.440]   And it comes from two veterans of texas tribune and they're amazing and brilliant and wonderful and this is a great great great effort
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:19.600]   And i'm excited about journalism in texas texas tribune big cool model
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.400]   And then we've got this there's probably other experiments i'm not aware of but
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:27.200]   Go texas i'm proud
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:34.800]   Is this in austin or or where yes i'm curious because that's where texas tribune is so that they kind of okay
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:41.360]   And is it named after those were all of texas media really i mean like texas month is there 19th amendment. Yeah, yeah, okay
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.200]   prohibits the states from denying the right to vote for the citizens of the united states best based on the basis of
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.280]   gender
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.120]   Let us and if you go to the paper yes one last thing
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:59.200]   I love the dress that the in the about us section that the lady is wearing because it's awesome

[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.160]   Uh

[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:52.400]   73.7 million well once again remitter saving us and african-american women are saving us
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.320]   and um
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.320]   deaths are due
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:00.560]   You know what else is due our picks of the week coming up next
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.520]   Stacy's filing i'll wait um i'm typing in the chat room
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.800]   She does like a loud keyboard. She really loves a loud keyboard. She's she's admitted it
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:18.480]   Someone pointed out that austin is the only democratic stronghold in texas and that's absolutely not true
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.520]   No
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.320]   Born texas like georgia is starting to swing
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:27.760]   Starting to swing there is a new do you have a mac and tush by the way
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.640]   Because there's a new app you might enjoy
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.760]   Oh, yeah, I talked about it on that break weekly. It's called unclack
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:39.120]   And you leave it running on uh on your mac
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.800]   And when you're in a zoom call or maybe doing a podcast and it mutes your microphone whenever you type
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:49.360]   Oh, I just am constantly on mute, but I am totally getting that unclack
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.720]   Unclack.com. Unclack me. Stacy yiggin bathroom your
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.920]   oh wait
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.080]   You
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.800]   Uh she can't she can't talk now somebody's wrong on the internet
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:11.680]   Nope, I'm right here and I have a thing your pick of the week go ahead Stacy's thing
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:17.600]   All right, what are my goals this year and y'all are hearing about it first not even my regular people know this
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:24.080]   Hey, hey, we were people geez. Sorry my iot newsletter subscribers in
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:30.080]   That's better. There's absolutely no reason not to subscribe that have I mentioned that yes, there's no reason
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:36.880]   Um, one of my goals this year is to make the really boring parts of my house smart
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:43.840]   So i'm looking at you know the flow or fin water's leak detection monitors whole home and the detection monitors
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.120]   i'm looking at uh breaker box monitors things like that because I i'm really interested in
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:57.600]   How we can actually make our building smarter and more adaptive for energy conservation for better health outcomes for people
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:02.560]   So i'm i'm automating the boring stuff with apologies to tony fidel
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:10.160]   Um, and one of those things is my water heater. So I just got my that's very boring. It is boring. Yeah, but the water heater
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.800]   Until it stops working. The second
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:19.200]   Well, yeah that too. It uses the second largest amount of electricity in your home for most homes after hveck
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.520]   Did you have an electric water here?
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.040]   Um, a lot of people do because I have a gas. What a lot of people do. Oh, okay
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.760]   I had electric and charlotte for this gas
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:33.920]   You know what my water heater does use a lot of electricity because I have a recirculating pump on it
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.760]   And that uses probably is more electricity than anything else in the house. So
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:44.960]   Okay, um, and there's a big push for whole home electrification in california. I'm sure you're aware of that. Yes
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:52.000]   It's a big thing. Uh, because we generate our own electricity on our roof. So we would like to do that actually
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.480]   Yeah, so this is the device. This is going to go on your water heater. It's going to measure a couple things
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:03.840]   Mostly it determines how hot it gets and it learns over time to understand your
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:10.560]   The times you need hot water. Oh, um, so you doesn't all see the water unnecessarily
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.840]   Right. So it it keeps the temperature. I mean it never lets it it never turns it off
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:18.320]   But it lowers the temperature that you want to maintain it at
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:22.960]   Um, which saves a lot of electricity because keeping water hot is is
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.000]   Kevin yeah, what's the name of that?
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.760]   aquanta a q u a n t a
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:35.600]   Reem r h e e m makes one as because they're a big water heater manufacturer
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:39.840]   Um, whirlpool has started to introduce smart water heaters
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.240]   But this one retrofits to just about any electric one out there in many gas ones
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:51.200]   And it's a fairly quick install. You just will I say this now theoretically i haven't installed it yet because it just arrived
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:56.480]   But I can tell you more about it after that, but it's turn the power off you pop it on you attach
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:02.800]   the sensors to the outside of the two water lines in and out and then you attach a
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:06.400]   Sensor somewhere else and that is yeah
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:12.320]   So that's what i'm doing. It's a hundred and twenty nine dollars. It also tells you how much hot water is available
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.680]   Oh, yeah, that was the other thing that's in the house on an s nice
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.760]   Yeah, it lets you see your hot water usage and I believe it'll actually let you set rules like
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:25.520]   Eventually you can chop your kids shower off after like 20
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.400]   Good buddy
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:34.640]   Oh, that's good. That just be fun. Always yell at it. That just be it just for a little fun
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:38.320]   So I'll give you some breaking news. Yes
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:41.760]   Expanding on your previous breaking news about twitter. It's gone further
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:47.120]   They just tweeted as a result of the unprecedented ongoing violence situation in washington d.c
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:55.040]   We've required the removal of three real Donald trump tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our civic integrity policy
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.560]   Second
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:00.320]   This means that the account of real Donald trump will be locked for 12 hours
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.840]   Holy moly
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.080]   Of these tweets if the tweets are not removed the account will remain locked well, you know
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.160]   He's not going to remove those tweets
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:14.160]   Future violations of the twitter rules including our civic integrity or violent threats policies will result in the permanent
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:16.880]   Suspension of the real Donald trump account
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:19.520]   Man last
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.520]   Well, so now my question for you all
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:29.120]   Will twitter as a whole get a little bit more quieter or will it get even louder now if this suspension happens?
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.200]   I think for a little while people be loud. I mean you can already see a supporter saying
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.840]   Ah, this is unfair. Lala. Lala. Yeah
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:42.240]   I've already seen I've already seen doctorate screenshots of his tweets saying this wasn't so bad was it?
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.480]   Uh, so I think we're going to see a lot of kerfuffle
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.520]   But if they stick to their guns you suck the oxygen from the room and maybe they'll go to parley. I don't know
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.640]   Yep
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.480]   They don't like it there because they can't rile up people and that's the goal right? Uh, yeah, and of course
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:04.240]   This will not be the most important issue for the president of the United States for the next couple of weeks
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.240]   So that's a good thing too
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.240]   Uh, give him something to distract
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:17.120]   Jeff Jarvis a number how about a number? Oh, we've got some we got such a panoply of digits panoply of digits
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.360]   We have a panoply of digits
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.680]   Um say that word
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.320]   Well, as would you say it
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.440]   Panoply panoply okay, I just grew up reading but I didn't realize okay
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:32.560]   How do you pronounce panoply
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:36.640]   That's pronounced panoply. That seems a little tautological, but okay
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.800]   It was
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:40.800]   I read a minute
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.800]   Uh
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.040]   Hey, okay, how do you pronounce panoply?
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.080]   That's pronounced panoply
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:51.520]   Very good
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.720]   The challenge is you have to know you're saying a word wrong to ask it. No, I just said it wrong
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.960]   You just don't know how yeah
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:03.200]   I just don't know. I mean like if I learned a word by reading it you could probably spell it by one
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.800]   Spell it
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.800]   How do you pronounce epitome?
