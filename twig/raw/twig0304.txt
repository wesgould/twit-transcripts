[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.960]   Jeff Jell-oh professor journalism City University of New York Hello Jeff
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.400]   How are you today?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.060]   Got the day. Are you like it because you're a professor and I spell that P. E. R. F. E. S
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.940]   You're a professor does this mean you get the summer off? No, cuz I I
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.720]   Center so you profess all year round. Yes. I'm sorry. That's whether you want me to or not
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:17.400]   Also with us Mike Elgin the man in charge of tech news tonight our daily dose of tech news every Monday through Friday 10 a.m. Pacific
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.800]   Good to have you again ready to be here. I love the show
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.760]   It's so nice when I I always listen to it whether I'm on or not and usually when I'm in my kitchen doing the dishes
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.520]   This saves time
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.280]   Well, nobody can hear me when I'm shouting at the you know this time. I have a microphone and actually a lexicon here me now
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.960]   I have my Amazon Echo came yesterday. So did Kevin. Oh, it did. He's really impressed by it. He's he's pretty cool
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.040]   Yeah, so mine wasn't supposed to come till like August
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.800]   But they I think Amazon does this they drop it suddenly and then like literally yesterday said it's on its way what and it came
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   That's great. Yeah, it's pretty cool. I
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.760]   Notice we're not I mean already set it up in the kitchen
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.720]   It's not like after Michael asked it a few times to tell a joke
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.560]   And I asked it to read my audio book and then said okay, that's enough
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.600]   The daily briefing I played with a little bit that's kind of cool
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.560]   You can say give me my daily briefing and you set that up ahead of time, but it has NPR another audio
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.000]   News. Yeah, that's kind of it's like the radio. Yeah, it's like a radio. You can talk to yeah, I guess yeah
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Did it read did it?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.120]   Computerized reading of your book. No, you're you're you're you're it's my audible. It's audible Amazon owns audible
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.680]   So it makes sense. So and that features like 24 hours old something like pretty just launched that yeah, you know what I did discover
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   Is because I was asking on on the shows yesterday
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.360]   Should I use my iOS or my Android device to set up because it works with both and then I thought you know
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   I wonder if I use a Kindle fire
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.960]   If it'll be different the Amazon tablet and it is is it the fire interface much more elaborate really lots more
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.720]   You can do they give you suggestions to use the tablet space
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.760]   I think it's yeah
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.160]   I think it feels like it's you know kind of well Amazon's gonna favor you're using three phones now, aren't you?
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.920]   least
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.120]   Welcome to the future is not depressing
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   All right, let's let's see what else is going on in the world you have a little scooplet mr. Mike
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.320]   Elgin well, this is this is some actually this is somebody who addressed this to me
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.760]   You're talking about the the Google survey around
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.720]   The idea of a Google monthly movie pass as a put a Google movies you can rent movies of course and buy them right right
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.080]   So somebody named Hugo Sejas or Seyas
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.760]   Got a survey in Google survey that's something you sign up for the Google opinion rewards exactly
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.040]   And he asked me if I knew if something was being developed and the answer is no
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.760]   I don't but it's interesting that somebody is asking about the possibility
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.880]   So it looks like a Google monthly movie pass is something they're thinking about and I really think this is the future of all
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   streaming and downloading content as we see with Apple
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.560]   Music which is that one of their key differentiators is the family plan
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.080]   They're always looking for these ways to bundle and discount and so on
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.480]   Yeah, and I think that has everything to do with how they can make how they can lower prices in turn
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.880]   Even in a way that's acceptable to the content creators right right so presumably Google can go to Hollywood and say you know
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.200]   Yeah, we'd like to have this monthly movie pass which maybe gives you a discount or does this that the other thing
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.160]   Yeah, so who knows who knows where they're working who knows
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.120]   Or this guy's just getting trolled
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.720]   Well, what's strange is it asks him if he has one which he couldn't unless they're people who do
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.080]   And we just don't know about it a great AB test in the sky. Yes, like it's like
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.720]   Hey, just do you have one well no, I don't but where could I get one? It's like
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.080]   Hmm
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   It makes sense, you know in fact that's in a way what Apple announced on Monday is that they're going to finally instead of just
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.880]   selling music
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.080]   They're gonna let you stream it kind of a monthly kind of like Google all access or Spotify actually Spotify had a big announcement
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:23.820]   Today they are boy are they taking off. Yeah? Yeah, what did they say a hundred they had now of 20 million paid subscribers?
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.820]   Now what's interesting about that is it took them?
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.120]   five years to get to the point where they had ten million and
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.840]   Then it took them one minute one year to go from to double that to go from ten million to twenty million
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.200]   So they've doubled in one year the number of paid
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.520]   streaming subscribers and something like a hundred million now or 80 million total
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.120]   Yes, like 75 something like that. I believe it's 55 unpaid. So yeah, that would be 75
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.000]   Million total which is a huge number and and the but really to have 20 million in this market. It's a very large number
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.880]   It is easily. I mean Pandora's the biggest with a hundred million users
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.800]   I don't know how many yeah subscribers they have Spotify's number two by the way this came out as part of a raise
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   They're they're raising money. They just raised another more than half a billion dollars five hundred twenty six million dollars
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.960]   And that basically tells you investors feel like they have the inside track against Apple
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.640]   Yeah, this would be the time that Spotify would try to raise money
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.720]   But people might be reluctant to give them money waiting to see what Apple music does now that we've seen what Apple has announced
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.520]   I think Spotify is in a great position. I don't think what Apple announces really setting the world on fire
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.840]   I saw a lot of shrugs didn't you yeah?
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:47.400]   Absolutely clear that the only thing that would propel Apple music forward is just that it's Apple right that it's on every iPhone that
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.480]   It's on every I presume every iPad that you get three months free
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:08:01.080]   It's funny though the one thing that's a really a big differentiator for Apple music is this 24-hour radio station
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.200]   Which is not exactly innovative right that's where the DJ they hired from BBC one went
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.640]   There he'll be coming out of Los Angeles. There's a DJ. I think in New York and then one in London
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.920]   But that's free everybody you'll get that yep
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.040]   You don't have to buy it already was free BBC one if they're gonna essentially gonna recreate
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.040]   One BBC one has been available available globally to every single person with internet connection for years and
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:33.680]   Nobody has cared about it. Yeah, and so this is not a differentiator for Apple. I think it's kind of weird actually
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.040]   Yeah, the idea of a once-taught is fits all DJ'd radio station. It's weird
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.640]   I don't get it. Yeah
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.880]   And you know I keep thinking that this Connect service is essentially a place for
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.760]   Artists to post all their stuff their concerts to interact with fans and so on
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.520]   I think that could maybe kind of sort of be a differentiator for Apple
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.640]   Although we don't know what that's gonna look like but I can see that for a lot of super fans if
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.160]   Superstars like Lady Gaga and and and and really big artists like that
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.200]   are devoted to the Apple site to Apple Connect then I
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.080]   Can see a lot of fans going there and sort of taking away followers from Twitter and places where they're already interacting with fans
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.120]   Yeah, but maybe yeah, maybe and if anybody crazy Apple and Jimmy Iovine can do that
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.840]   I guess what people really seem to think a lot of Jimmy Iovine. I don't I feel like he's taken Apple down
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   Basically antiquated road the old music label way of doing things down to the point of having a radio station
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.720]   Seems very retro, right my brother-in-law was it is is it Google?
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.560]   I'm sorry is it the Apple
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.840]   WWDC and he pointed out that they're selling Apple
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.680]   t-shirts for like 25 bucks
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   In other words Apple makes really what they've become tons of money on literally every single thing that they offer in any context
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.400]   Yeah, they Apple is a recording superstar, right?
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:09.360]   So I think what Jimmy Iovine brings to Apple from Apple's point of view is is radical profitability in music whether they can pull it off
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.160]   Or not I don't know right I think I think generally speaking overall
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.840]   They're hatching a scheme where they're gonna make money not from the streaming not from downloads not from any of that stuff
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.080]   But from other stuff it's so funny because beats one which is their version as
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.120]   If like it's it's it's almost as if we've invented radio on the internet
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:36.080]   Yeah, if you have tuning in radio on your iPhone you have 30,000 radio stations
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.080]   Yeah available right now
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:45.480]   24/7 global the we invented radio on the internet is literally a joke on HBO South Valley radio on the internet
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.720]   We've invented it. Yeah, so I just I you know this is not the Apple show. We certainly discovered it
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.800]   Yeah, on Monday and Tuesday, but I think it's going on and there's a few other things in the rundown that I think that
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.300]   Apple is now attacking the advertising business model
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:07.840]   Hacking the attack in the average business model a couple ways. So that's that's what cooks whole
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:16.040]   Sweet about privacy is privacy depends upon data to target and Apple says well, we don't do that because we don't we never figured out how to do advertising
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:22.280]   But but having having lost that they attack Google that way. That's number one and then number two
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.080]   I just saw Josh Benton at Neiman
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.040]   I follow in news just had a panic attack because he saw that iOS 9. There's ad blocking
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:40.400]   Oh, interesting and so I think I think you see something coming together here where Apple's going to
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.560]   Like you know a news Corp say we're gonna make our money on on finding ways to charge consumers and
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.360]   Not to be dependent about advertising. That's gonna be our business differentiation area interest
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.600]   We're gonna attack we're gonna use the consumers we have
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   to attack
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.840]   Those who are supported by advertising which includes not only Google but also all of media. Yeah
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:09.060]   Yeah, well, but that's so look at if I were Apple putting myself in their shoes. I'd go all in on that
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.040]   That's differentiator. Okay. That much is okay
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.000]   But when you build an ad blocker into your operating system
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.560]   You're having a huge impact on the entire media and especially journalism industries
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.720]   You're having an impact on society now you can argue that that you know a fast-forward button was built into BCR's got it
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.960]   You know, okay, there's no God given right to force advertising on people
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.460]   However, if you kind of make it too easy to block this because people don't like it
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:44.680]   Then there's an easy or a spot to impact just block iOS from your website. It's like who it's like people complaining about Google News
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.760]   Just you don't have to participate you say hey if you're an I always I'm sorry
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.440]   We can't show you ads so we were not gonna show you our site. Yeah, but there's also these these these
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.920]   black mailing ad blockers
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.240]   Right that ad blood plus will go to you and say if you would like to be seen
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.000]   All you have to do is be so that that is racketeering. It is just straight out racketeering
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.600]   but apparently legal and I think it's more complicated because they have a
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:18.240]   Approved ad policy that you can't have flash in the ad you can't have you say if they listen if they were truly
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.200]   Consumers they wouldn't charge they wouldn't they wouldn't well their extort the money out of the company. Yeah, there's ad block
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.520]   Which there's there's it's also that's the other thing. It's a little confusing. There's there's a business
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.440]   And then there's an open source project and actually I think I'm confusing them one of them is
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.280]   forget which one is
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   Is it adblock plus
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.800]   That is
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   pure and adblock that's not
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.840]   You know their competitors adblock plus says
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:53.440]   Used by over 50 million people a free ad blocker for Chrome adblock says the number one ad blocker with over 200 million downloads
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.760]   Ad which one switch I think adblock plus is the one that has approved
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.240]   They did the deal with Google they have the approved track where for a small fee
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:13.160]   You can get through and adblock I believe is the open source one, but I had a lot plus plus is a programming
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   I
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.080]   Might be wrong on those it's certainly that is certainly controversial
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.920]   Yeah
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   And up but I but I think
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.120]   This is where apples headed Apple wanted to have an ad model
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.600]   They they tried that but they failed because they don't have the whole world what we keep ignoring and I'm gonna get you know
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.960]   Apple fanboys going after me, but
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:43.200]   Android's the biggest by far Android is where the reach in the and the volume is and it's gonna be worldwide and
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.880]   So Apple sees that it's not gonna be able to kill the ad market. It's already failed at the ad market
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.960]   So why don't why not just attack the ad market?
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Yeah, and the downside for that the potential downside for Apple is that in fact advertising is a very
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.000]   democratizing form of monetization
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:07.840]   Simply because it's a it's a it's a transfer of wealth from the people who buy ads to to those who don't or can't so
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.320]   You know who in the world let me hear that again because I need to understand that why is that why is this democratizing?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.480]   Okay, so let's say you have somebody who lives in who lives in
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:23.440]   Some country and makes $15 a month. Yeah, right? Okay, and and there's a story for it to pay a buck a month
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.800]   You're not gonna buy any of this stuff
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.040]   But you can he can use if he can get on the internet he can get everything you get on Twitter or
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.360]   You know Google search feed or Google search is supported by ads to get that for exactly and the reason
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:43.040]   You're absolutely right Mike and it goes further too is that now in a world where we all have our own websites that can be supported by advertising
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.080]   then
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:51.000]   That's democrat. That's doubly democratizing. Yeah, there's a can support more people speaking and you know
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.200]   You know just have a small 1% able to buy the content from a small oligarchy of media
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.960]   Which is where it heads if we kill advertising. Yeah, but but Apple's gonna say well, it's not our responsibility to preserve
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.800]   Media it's our
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:13.320]   Customers want well, but does that mean that means interfering with the business right when I when I give you a website and say I can
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.320]   Give this for free. I do it under
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.600]   some
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.000]   Business rule, so I say here's the website, but I have ads with it. That's the deal
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   right and
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.080]   Apple is interfering with that
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:32.720]   They're they're they're enabling the changing of the site to do that. Yeah, and and and that would be like saying
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.800]   I'm gonna do a service
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.160]   Well, I'll take the newspaper and I'll cut out all the ads for you and deliver that to you
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:46.800]   Apple is yeah, and Apple's for the global 1%ers no question about that. Yes, but for them to suggest that
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.160]   that and that their attack on advertising is somehow a
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.360]   An ethical issue or something like that. I mean Tim Cook makes it like you know
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.180]   The those evil advertising companies are harvesting your data. Well, that's doing this bad thing
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.600]   We're the good pure and right people no
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.480]   We're the we're the people who sell really expensive stuff and make a ton of money on stuff that most of the world can't even dream of affording
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.960]   And so we have the luxury yeah kill some people
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.360]   Drive people suicide making these things, but never mind now. Yeah
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.400]   So but okay
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.320]   And every time I get this battle go on Apple. No, no, this is good every time I get no no
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.760]   This is a conversation. We cannot have too much. I think on this now
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.360]   We're gonna some we've had it many times that I met it with Steve Gibson because he loves ad blockers
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.760]   He's concerned about privacy more than almost anybody
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:42.640]   Part of this is the ad industries fault right for making ads that are so
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.040]   Terrificly over the top and annoying and and the response by the way to add blockers is to make it worse is not to make it
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   Not to back down right and be you know peak about all the things that were used for targeting right?
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:02.240]   My my entire argument is the salvation of the news business is gonna have to be to be more relevant
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.480]   That means we have to know people as individuals. That means we have to have data otherwise known as information about them
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.600]   So we can give them greater relevance and when voluntary doesn't grow with that
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   But the ad industry and the media industry and the technology industry all
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.240]   By being opaque allowed that to be demonized. We talked about that on the show many many times the wall's journals
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.880]   What do they know and now apples just playing right into that?
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   the same as as news Corp has and
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.840]   You know, it's interesting we had on our webpage
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.640]   very
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.840]   kind of
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.760]   Odd eclectic privacy policy it's with that TV which I wrote many years ago and which was somewhat out of date saying
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.520]   We don't want anything about we don't want to know anything about you and so we're not gonna collect anything about you and
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.280]   Go on going about your business that changed over time because we put Google Analytics on there
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.600]   Cuz we do want to know how much we don't want to know anything about you
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.360]   But we do want to know how many people visit our page and stuff
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.160]   But Google Analytics then gives Google a kind of a window into our users plus there's ad banners on our site
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.800]   Which that those came later? Yeah, and of course whenever you serve an ad banner the ad server or whatever it might be
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.360]   And I believe it's Google
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:15.720]   It's Google. It's doing that gets information about you who anybody visits our website. So we got then we got approached by a
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.840]   organization created by the ad industry and
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:28.400]   They said you have to fix your site and tell people what you're doing or we're gonna report you
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.360]   We're gonna turn you into the FTC and I think that my initial reaction will screw you
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:40.000]   But I think what it really is is the ad industry responding probably to a consent decree with the FTC
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.600]   But maybe not maybe just proactively saying well, we better get this and so when you see that ad choices thing
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:50.320]   That's it. They said you need to have a much better privacy policy. That's very clear about what you're doing
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.840]   It's so interesting because this came from the ad industry
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:20:00.320]   Yeah, and you need to have a link that says add choices that shows what you can do to opt out and and it's it's the
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.160]   Industry trying to self-regulate before the government comes in. Yeah says well, you better you better get your house in order
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.000]   So there is some awareness of this yeah, and and we spend a lot of time and money by the way making that work
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.600]   Yeah, and personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with ad blockers when people choose
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.840]   I don't like the idea of ad blockers that are enabled by companies as an opt-out kind of thing
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.560]   But I think that for anybody who wants to opt into an ad blocker. That's fine and nobody
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.760]   You know advertising is not a requirement for you to
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:36.680]   To listen to or purchase the things that they're advertising or do any of that stuff if you are going to decide in advance
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.360]   You're not going to buy anything from advertising
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.120]   And you don't you're not going to read them anyway, and you don't care about them
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   And you don't want to see them that's fine
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.320]   You know the vast majority of people who get ads served to them are never going to act on those ads
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.040]   They're never going to click on them or even look at them
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:56.360]   And so that's just that's fine. There's nothing wrong that even raises the issue of do ads work at all to banner ads work at all
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.920]   Does anybody even see him anymore? I don't see that's that's exactly the point and I think that's that's right
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.320]   But what what is going to make them work greater relevance? What fuels great relevance?
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.800]   for
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.000]   Information exactly and you know let's try another you know on the right or wrong
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.880]   Idea here. What if Apple provided a mechanism and we know the technology exists
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.720]   We see the jokes about it, you know millennials become snake people and said oh, we're not gonna bother your pretty little head
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.280]   We'll create a product that takes out anything that's
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   Google related
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.560]   We'll take take out you know we will take a given publication and give it to you cleansed of something
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.480]   Yeah, we should mention ads cleanse of content that Apple themselves are not making the ad blockers
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.920]   They've just made it possible to do on iOS what they're or they're about to make it possible to do an iOS
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   What you've been able to do on safari and sorry?
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.520]   Yes, and firefox all along which is they've enabled that capability for people to
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.160]   Add to safari for iOS
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.400]   So Apple hasn't really taken a stand in there. I mean it's kind of
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:06.040]   It's kind of like they're saying well you can if you want to and of course a user would have to download this right
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.000]   User would have to install it. I don't I
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.680]   Don't know I feel like it should be up to the user
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.960]   But well use it's the same thing. I feel like you don't this argument is very much like the Napster argument
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:29.040]   I feel like it's it's what we need to do is educate users and viewers and listeners and readers that this free content is provided to you
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.200]   Thanks to our advertisers. I think our audience knows that well there was a horrible
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.080]   It's like it's in the rundown there was what I think was I didn't read the whole study
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   But what I've seen about an awful
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.600]   Pen study on advertising. Oh where to go was in the rundown wasn't it?
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   By the way the group that called us is the digital advertising alliance
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:59.040]   And I I never really quite figured out why they were harassing us
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.400]   We did comply because it's the right thing to do
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.760]   But my sense is that this is probably funded by the yeah, you know the IAB and the other ad
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.560]   People saying well, we better do something here
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.400]   Because if we don't the government will some reason I can't get the
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:24.760]   Comments to work on there. We go. I just here's a story about it. So there's a there's a pen
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.280]   universe Pennsylvania study
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.720]   By three academics saying well consumers don't like this idea of exchanging data for for content
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.920]   But the way they worded every damn question was so loaded
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.800]   You know do you agree that it's okay to get to discount something if you're in love the story to monitor
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.400]   You you agree. It's okay to get content if it's okay for people to take information about you and you don't know it
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.160]   You know it just it's just stacks them puts the thumb on the scale on the way
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:58.680]   This is done you couldn't you could turn around and say would you like to have one one hundredth of the content you have today?
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:04.520]   Yeah, would you like to pay a huge fortune to companies that with the music industry has said though?
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.120]   Oh long as it if you keep piracy firing music, you're never gonna get any
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.840]   Okay fair point
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   but I think that
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.600]   The point here is it's trying to argue that along with cook that oh
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.320]   Data is evil data is bad data is just information
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:28.120]   And and and and relationships are based on data on information cook is saying is we want to give you a choice
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.880]   Because it feels a little bit
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   Genuous because then the other you know they say that and then the then they crow about how many credit card numbers they have I mean
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.920]   But I think it's I think it's good business for them to say we're in the favor of privacy
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.440]   Not everybody is other companies want to use information to tailor ads or whatever
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.920]   We don't want to connect that they even sit on stage on Monday. We don't want to know at that
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:59.520]   We don't want to have that information about you and that's a perfectly reasonable place for them to be and if consumers really want that
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:05.800]   That's a compelling sales point. Yeah, are you guys familiar with Google contributor? No, what's that?
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:13.240]   You know what this is I've never heard of this until last night on all that Android Ron mentioned it basically it ties directly with
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.680]   We talked about a year
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.920]   Heard of this until yes, I was like what are you talking about?
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.720]   But this is a very few and limited number of blogs where you can
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.520]   Pay directly for a blog
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.320]   $2 $5 $10 a month
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.240]   But the participating sites are very limited in fact and then we're gonna do this
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:40.160]   Just today every daily news paper in Germany signed on with Blendell which is a micro payment platform
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.800]   The belief in my industry has been the micro payments will save it so people will just give 10% 20 cents for an article
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.700]   It'll all be okay BS never gonna work we consider to pay wall early on and I just didn't well you did
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.760]   Oh, yeah, we've considered all forms of monetization
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.200]   My initial plan was to be a like the modern patreon to be a
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.560]   Subscrew not some not forced subscriber but voluntary subscriber. Yeah paid donations. That's still kind of
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.040]   Lingers on on the website and people do give money in a few thousand dollars a month and I appreciate that. Thank you
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.800]   But we couldn't but the option of saying having a paywall or we even consider that sometimes now
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:23.960]   Maybe we should make certain things have behind a paywall like chat behind a paywall, which by the way
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   We're not gonna do don't worry
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.280]   But it's gonna kill chat and start a paywall go ahead
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.560]   It is fundamentally undemocratic in fact that was one of the
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.080]   Criticisms you had is what about the guy who her buck a month sounds like nothing to us
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.040]   But what about the guys making 15 bucks a month? That's a very good point
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:50.060]   We want we don't want to be undemocratic but also when you have a technically sophisticated audience any paywalls doomed to failure
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:55.360]   Dig nation did that briefly they said if you pay if you donate to dig nation
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.520]   We'll give you early access to the show like a week ahead of time in fact. They're doing it again
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.880]   They're bringing back dignity. They're gonna do a one-off and if you donate to it. It's quite expensive
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.400]   You can get it ahead of everybody else and what what happens with the technically literate audiences?
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.200]   They immediately say oh yeah, I'll buy it give it to everybody
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.520]   You can't for suddenly if you have a paywall you're in the whack-a-mole business and I don't want to be in the whack-a-mole business
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.640]   I
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.200]   Actually think that when when you talk about this whole issue of advertising contextual advertising
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.520]   I I am bugged by the by the fact that it's an airheaded conversation to say that
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.880]   contextual advertising or or any sort of
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:39.720]   Personal data collection is bad is to say is like saying drugs are bad
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.840]   Well, you know heroin is bad, but the Novocaine that their lidocaine or whatever it is
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.520]   They used to dull the my teeth before the dentist starts drilling is good
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.000]   You know, it's not that data collection is bad is that that?
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.280]   There's a potential for bad data collection to abuse and sell your personal data
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.040]   That which could lead to spamming and exposure to all kinds of problems
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.160]   And so you know some some data collection is is
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.680]   Divorced from the individual so they just basically say okay
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.160]   We want to know what you're doing where you're doing it?
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.920]   How much you're doing it?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.120]   How much you get paid all this stuff?
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.680]   But your name is not associated with it and that'll be lumped into a big database with a million other people
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.160]   So we know that you know, there's stuff about this large population. There's absolutely nothing
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.800]   Privacy violating about that the problem is that we don't have nobody has that conversation
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:37.280]   It's either like oh put up ad blocks and we prevent anybody from knowing anything about us or we give everything away and
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:45.240]   Those are not the two choices actually and in fact Apple is so good at communicating this stuff because they're collecting all kinds of information
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.400]   And they they're keeping it on the phone
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.400]   right, but there's a lot of that out in the outside of Apple as well they didn't invent that the idea of
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.640]   giving you the benefits of
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:05.120]   Data collection without actually abusing your privacy lots of companies do that including Google to a very large extent much of the data collection
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.600]   They do is completely harmless and does not violate your privacy. They're just lousy at communicating. It was more honest in some ways
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.160]   Yeah, Apple's more disingenuous about this. Well, I think no, I think I think Apple
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:25.720]   Apple is I let what I appreciate about what Apple's doing from from their keynote actually a Monday is that they pointed out that look
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   we are giving you many of the benefits with your iPhone of
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:36.080]   Location data and all this kind of stuff with with Siri and preem you know preemptive
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.520]   Notifications all that kind of stuff, but it never leaves the phone
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.960]   We're not gonna take it and put it in a remote database and share it with anybody and all that kind of stuff. Okay, so
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.040]   Everybody who does that sort of thing needs to communicate it the way Apple did so that we know the difference between
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   The kind of data collection we want and the kind we don't want. Yeah, and so if if I would
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:06.000]   Fault Google for anything is their failure to communicate. Yeah, what they're doing with the data and to sell it to us
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I want to be sold on
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.240]   The benefits of their data collection. They just say oh here
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.480]   You know, here's here's our you know, here's the information. Here's your dashboard about all things do that right?
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.640]   They say what they've got what they know, but you're right now
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:24.200]   I need to be very clear about how it's used but all on the rundown somewhere is I put an economist piece up where where it's
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:31.600]   The algorithm capital T capital A and in there it says I went to Google and I found out what they thought about me
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.520]   And they were wrong what this is that you know, it's just a hard targeting man. It's just no great mystery
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:42.160]   This is also a screed on rewrite read right then I guess the new read right web reborn. Yes
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.480]   Today, that's the that's the you're showing
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:53.280]   Which is kind of ridiculous because it it it mystifies the algorithm so condemn us to find the algorithm
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:59.160]   And you know an algorithm is nothing but a formula and data is nothing but information and and we've a lot
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.520]   We as an industry have allowed all this to become too priestly and mysterious and it's biting us in the ass
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:10.000]   Because we've done this. Yeah now algorithms are mysterious. I think I talked about it my visit to to
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   Facebook it was it was kind of like how do we explain algorithms? You just you know a formula to do something nice for you
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   that's all and and
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:24.600]   I think the priestly cast of geeks made it made it seem so mysterious that it's really gonna be harmful to them
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.500]   Well, and then there's also if you start
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:38.200]   Blocking ads then what the other thing that happens the unintended consequences is the ads go underground in fact CNN has announced a
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.840]   New unit. This is from fair fair.org
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.320]   Called get this courageous
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:54.920]   Which will not report news but instead will take money from corporations to produce content that resembles news but is actually PR
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:02.000]   They're going to and this is kind of what the New York Times does with its native content native. It's all yeah
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.400]   They're gonna help companies create CNN like
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.280]   stories
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.480]   Because who's big is better at that all following BuzzFeed's model. Yeah
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.280]   Your times does it BuzzFeed does it journal does it?
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:22.400]   They have native content units and CNN is now gonna do this and this is my problem is as soon as you start pushing ads
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:29.020]   Underground advertisers want to reach you they're gonna reach you there's another they start doing native content or you put Pepsi
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:34.400]   Cans on this table and I mean that's just that's the next thing. It's gonna be everywhere in other ways
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   I actually don't mind
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.880]   You know advertising that is
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:46.720]   Comes in the form of articles as long as it's clear as I'm not tricking the consumer
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   There's nothing wrong with with that sort of
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.000]   I'm not that's why it works is because it tricks consumers right if it didn't trick consumers
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.520]   It'd just be another long ad and nobody'd look at it
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:02.400]   I talked on the show about how I did a test with with the word promoted and and 54% of the people didn't know what it meant
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.760]   No CNN says this isn't about confusing editorial with advertising. This is about telling advertisers stories
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:14.600]   Telling similar stories, but clearly labeling and differentiating that this is CNN
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.200]   We're not here to blur the lines. This is exactly what the New York Times ladies said remember in that speech we played
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.800]   No, people know the difference
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.480]   I
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.400]   Think it's apparent the reason advertisers want native content is because people don't know the difference
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.360]   Well, why is always always wanted this we're just so desperate
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.760]   Now we're selling our soul we're doing it. Well, you know
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.440]   I ran out of him weekly their advertisers came in and tried to make a page look just like editorial
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.360]   He said no, no, no, you can't do that. Okay. They try another thing and now we're saying okay, and here's the price
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.680]   Right we're competing with each other and we're gonna commodify even our soul
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:54.880]   Well, it's good for me because it means yeah the people who don't do that like us will shine. Yes, I hope there's this
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.440]   But also leads there's this read right piece. I was mentioning which is which is the ticket. You spell irony
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.880]   It's all about how I hate advertising advertising is awful, but of course it's brought to you by Disney
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:12.920]   So here's the unintended consequence consequence that I've never heard anybody talk about which I think is around ad blocking
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.680]   Which I'd love for us to start a conversation about
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:23.000]   Generally on an ongoing basis and it's always like a lot well it goes like this certain types of people
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.640]   Are going to do ad blocking technical people right people who you know
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.680]   Smart people who are paying attention who feel comfortable
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.480]   Adding things to their browser, you know
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.880]   extensions and so on and that excuse the
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.520]   the money frankly that there's in the hands or
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.880]   That's targeting those kinds of people it changes the the basically the nature of
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:56.400]   Theoretically the nature of the the general mix of companies that are succeeding on long if you want to know why tech TV went away
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   I could tell you exactly
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:07.000]   Advertisers I was told this by a tech TV executive because I I was very much lobbied tech TVs executives to focus on
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.480]   I said there's one and a half million programmers in the United States. That's an
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.360]   Computer programmers. That's enough people to make this a viable channel
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.280]   Yeah focus super serve that audience and I was told in no
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.080]   Uncertain words that the brands don't want this they say
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.920]   smart people don't
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.440]   Are not seduced by brand advertising. They don't buy by brand. They're smart
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.680]   We don't want smart people
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   Yeah, and so that's to underscore what you're saying the people who block ads that people are smart the people who are insightful
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.120]   Advertisers already don't want you. That's why there is no tech TV
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:47.920]   We they can't make it financially viable exactly an ad blockers are a direct action a direct expression of that of that notion
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   Let me just give an extreme example
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.320]   Let's let's say the Raspberry Pi people wanted to advertise Raspberry Pi a wonderful product
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:05.760]   That's aimed at a very specific type of person and then on the other hand contrasting with that you have a a sort of snake oil salesman selling a weight loss pill
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.920]   okay
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.560]   The what's gonna happen is that the type of people who they're gonna advertise to for the Raspberry Pi are gonna be using ad blockers
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   Right the ad will be completely ineffective
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:23.560]   the weight loss pill is gonna be everywhere they're gonna make a fortune and the the internet will be overrun with weight loss pills and
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.040]   And the people who would buy some products and the people who would build a better tomorrow
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.600]   We'll never discover the razcer if you
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:36.880]   Because because they're using ad blockers. So so it's it's just it's a it's a the demographic issue needs to be
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.480]   I do raise
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.240]   The point which is also important which is it's a minuscule number that use ad blocks and even in our
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.760]   Sophisticated audience. I don't think I think that we probably have a much larger percentage of people using ad blockers
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.560]   Right, but you know, that's okay. All right chat room chat room. Fessed up. How many of you use that?
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.360]   Yeah, how many of you in the chat? I would say it's a large percent probably half
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.240]   How many people just say yes or no? Yes, you use that blocker. Don't you know? Yeah, yes or no?
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:10.040]   I have a no Patrick. No shouted Patrick. No, no me. No. Yes or no. Yes. I do not know. Yes
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.400]   It's about 50 50. I'd say well, I mean a lot of yeses are coming in
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:21.240]   By the way, this is this is public so I've seen it publicly but the Guardian
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.720]   Which has a membership program went to people who used ad blockers and said
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.240]   Would you consider you know like support in us with a membership and it was a very good conversion. Yeah
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.000]   Here's a guy runs a marketing agency who says yeah, I use it
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.200]   But see the ad blockers don't affect us particularly we have banner ads on their website
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:46.920]   And those are usually we do sell those not for a lot of money most they always go to an existing advertiser
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.120]   They're part of an overall ad buy the truth is the ads
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:56.240]   And by the way the new website the ads are the banners are very much reduced and very I think subtle
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.720]   We we really wanted to make the new website look good and not be overrun by that
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.000]   The ads that work are the ads that we do the interstitial ads that we do and that's one of the reasons
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.900]   We do them very differently and you know what there's no way I could stop somebody from fast-forwarding
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:13.080]   Yeah, and I bet you okay. Let me ask you that how many of you fast-forward through our ads
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.240]   And yet I got to say this
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:25.680]   What really happens and I think every podcaster knows this is that your community is so devoted to what you do that they buy the products
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:32.120]   Specifically to support you right our ads work better for advertisers because of our community
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.920]   It's a lot of our our ballon of I okay. Let's not I'm sorry. I asked that question
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.880]   Don't mention that that you skip the ads would you mind keeping that
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.400]   But I find I find my own behavior
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:51.640]   Being such that with like Howard Stern and Twitch shows I get I get I
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.400]   Had their part of the content like I want to hear why we do it that way exactly and and so yeah
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   We we want to incentivize you not to skip them right and we also want the community
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.360]   To be loyal to us and love us we want to make we want to soup
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.480]   We I always take the attitude
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.920]   Let's just super serve the community and they'll take care of us right and that's kind of the best way to do it
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.560]   And taking care of us by the way does not include donating
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.880]   I mean no agenda and other shows that are totally donated a donation run are always gonna be smaller
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.520]   Nobody's gonna be able to run an enterprise of this size with the 20 shows we do on donations alone
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.360]   It's just not doable if it's a couple of guys in a microphone maybe sure
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.560]   So but we're never gonna if somebody said if ever you block people use ad blockers
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.960]   I'll stop listening. We never would do that. That's not how we work
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.720]   In fact most of you who listen to shows you download the shows and you put them on a device of any kind
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:50.440]   We don't we don't in any way limit what devices you use and you listen to it. I mean that
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.720]   Let's let's let's go here. I think a media site. We forget paywalls
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:02.240]   Because what I when I argue to media sites is that you should you should calculate the value of a reader and act accordingly and
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.840]   a once a month reader becomes his value less a person uses an ad blocker is value less
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.160]   Person who comes often allows the ads has value so I would support I think you know
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.840]   What what a media site lose by blocking ad blockers?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.400]   Just saying if you're using that blocker, sorry, you can't you can't come to our stuff
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:25.280]   I would do it if you do it do it explicitly. Yeah, I would always have very much so say this is the deal folks
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:31.120]   Well, I'll tell you what they would lose though. Jeff, you know a lot of this is a long seduction for this kind of thing
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.880]   I mean if if
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:39.280]   Let's say somebody is is watching this show and it's the first twitch show they've ever watched and and there's they're trying a whole bunch of
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:47.000]   Podcasts and different types of internet shows and internet TV and they sort of watch and then they move on and go on and forget about us
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.720]   Well, I'll come back in another three months and watch again and you know to it may take two years before that person's like, you know
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:59.200]   What these shows are fantastic. I'm gonna sign up for all of them. I'm like absolutely. Yes, you're absolutely right
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.160]   And all I'm doing is making for the sake of the argument
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:08.040]   Yeah a corollary to the paywall argument because the exact same thing you just said about about that is true paywalls, too
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Now the argument back is alright
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.400]   You do a porous paywall where you get some sampling you're still
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:19.160]   Rewarding the freeloader and paid allizing the loyal customer, but even so I think you could do a
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.640]   block
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.440]   What do you want to call it a a block blocker?
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:29.640]   Notice I said be not see a block block. Yes
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.440]   and
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.160]   Do it a porous way, you know, you got okay folks
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:41.400]   Here's your first to five pages you get without ads and then we're we're starving you man because F you yeah
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.480]   Here's somebody sent a link in the chat room. Look at some aside
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.360]   And this is I don't want to pick on these guys, but this is a very similar site to a lot of sites extreme tech
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.200]   Yeah, which I think is still as if Davis's property. Yeah, there's a takeover at the top. That's an ad. Yeah
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.640]   Add add add add
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:07.720]   There's it's almost all ads. It's probably serves their advertisers terribly. I have to say I I don't I have just skipped through a bunch of ads
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.240]   I don't even know what they were for I don't yeah
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.400]   And I think everybody who watches this show knows that we don't even see them
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.480]   It's just it's not there's a chunk of our brain. That's not that's just not doing it
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:23.640]   Yeah, and I also hate this you might also like this has always driven me crazy. This is out of brain. All right that junk
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:31.240]   Yeah, that actually annoys me because it's there's an example of trying to trick. Yeah, that masquerades is actual content
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:36.520]   Uh, and it's not it's advertising content and that pisses me off. Yeah
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.440]   Um
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.360]   Chum boxes that's what it's called
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.560]   Because they're chumming. I think that's probably what it is called. There's they're chumming for viewers
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.120]   Like you would chum for sharks
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:53.080]   Um, but this is what the consequence is is and you know, I know why banner ads don't work
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.840]   That's why yeah, because people but if you if you this is my argument though
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.440]   If you as long as we keep going to a volume based reach and frequency business
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.240]   Then we're aft I agree
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:09.560]   We have to go to a higher value business and that it once again requires relevance and requires data. Yeah
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.440]   Which everybody says but we don't want to give you data. We want privacy
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.560]   So what's gonna happen?
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.480]   Like you're making an argument for give up your privacy because it's the only way to say no, but that no no no
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.960]   No, you're saying that I know to be a host of your show
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:32.440]   Uh, and you're and you're gonna get a twist my I just want people to like me Jeff. That's all I just want people
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   You're not giving up your privacy
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.400]   You're not giving a privacy at all. What am I giving up?
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.640]   I greek is I use I use all this stuff. I mean I use google now. I use everything
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.440]   No, I don't give up my privacy. What about me. I don't care. I
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.320]   When I buy at amazon and amazon stores what I buy. I'm not giving up my privacy
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:57.240]   Uh, would I use a frequent buyer card at the grocery store? I'm not giving up my privacy when I use a
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.800]   by my beloved united
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.760]   Uh miles and they know exactly where I've gone and they reward me as a result. I'm not giving up my privacy
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.800]   I'm making a transaction and it's a fine transaction
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.520]   Giving up your privacy is is is when there's a you know
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.240]   Well
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.680]   This one so after after visiting both facebook and google and being there at I owe
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.280]   One thing that occurred to me was that in essence they will always be two halves of the coin never joined
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.160]   Google knows more about
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.280]   uh
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:35.000]   Content than anybody else google has this incredible power to be able to analyze your photos and find golden retrievers
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.160]   Right facebook knows more about people than anybody else, but they don't know that much about content and and as a result
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.800]   We're kind of safe because no they can't put the two together. They're going to compete the only
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:51.160]   Entity that can put the two together is the government when it snoops on both in the internet, right?
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.680]   And that's why that's frightening. That's that's a true loss of privacy when you do not know what's happening to you
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.240]   You have no transaction whatsoever. You have no control and transparency whatsoever
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.880]   And they can tie together information that you in fact left to siloed multiple places
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.160]   They pull together government is the threat to your privacy my friends
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.280]   Well, that's true of course. What about people say well
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.560]   Yeah, but if google collects all that stuff and then gets a subpoena from the government
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.720]   They're going to give it to them then your problem is with the government and it's the pina with google
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:26.280]   No, and that's the New York times how to cover magazine how to cover store cover last week about technology is changing the world really
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   Oh
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:37.320]   And the times is on it. Yeah, exactly and in the editors know at the beginning it just now blithely says the technology companies
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:45.400]   Willingly cooperated with this right which is the opposite of truth and it's not true and they cooperated with with subpoenas and with
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.880]   with quiet
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.360]   warrants that they didn't have any choice but to cooperate with but there wasn't but that's that's just spreading a
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:58.280]   False meme to me the biggest problem with contextual advertising and then in the harvesting of all that data
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   As they seem to harvest a lot of data
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:07.640]   But the ads aren't particularly contextual where all these contextual ads that know exactly what I want or they recommend that stuff that you already bought
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.800]   I get it's so funny because the
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:15.480]   Proponents of ads I get as I surf around is stuff that we advertise for because I've already bought stuff like exactly
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.960]   And it's it's like I already bought it right it's like Amazon always tells you
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.640]   If you look at Amazon recommendations to buy stuff you just bought it's literally the least likely product you will
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.800]   I just bought that. I don't need it. Thank you. I'm not gonna buy two of them
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:38.040]   When I when I talk to some people at certain big California companies and I said we in media need more data and and the standard answer is
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.720]   You in media won't know what to do with it. Yeah, and they're right. Yeah, so really what you are
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.600]   Jeff is kind of the sibble
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.520]   You're you're inhaling the natural gas and you're saying I warn you
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:58.520]   This way leads madness. You shouldn't be doing this ad blockers are bad. You're gonna lose all the good content you ever cared about
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:05.480]   Yeah, and killing the killing the I just add blockers killing the ad market. Yeah killing the ad market by demonizing cookies
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.400]   And so on and so on
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.040]   What you're gonna end up with is a is a 1% served
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.600]   The Wall Street Journal will be fine. The Wall Street Journal keep going forever. Yeah, it'll be absolutely okay
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.040]   The financial times will be fine and their magazine called how to spend it
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:23.400]   They'll be they'll be great. The Rob report is not going away. Not going away, right?
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.800]   but uh
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.480]   Someone has mike said earlier someone who is poor and can't afford to buy this content
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:37.320]   Well, because there won't even be anything for them to buy because that that will have fallen apart before there's even an opportunity
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:42.680]   To spend on that so this whole idea that we should just shift away from advertising advertising is what I want to say it again
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.680]   Is what freed us allen rusper drew the now departed editor of the guardian
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:52.200]   So the advertising freed journalism from ownership and control by political parties
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:48:00.760]   Advertising is not a bad thing. It gives us free stuff. I just went to the rob report and there's an ad takeover by mcclaren
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.400]   Uh, yeah
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:08.040]   Those guys know where to advertise and it ain't on it's way I can tell you I can tell you that right now
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.880]   Be spoke tailoring at vestious new fifth avenue student. You don't even care if this is native content, right?
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:20.120]   Uh, it probably is who knows who cares finally a luxury super tank you can call your own
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.920]   The ripsaw ev2
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:29.800]   The world's fastest dual tracked all terrain vehicle. Oh, come on. We got to get them as an advertiser. Lee. I'd love I'd love to read that ad on
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   fellas, you know you want a tank
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.840]   Perhaps you thought you couldn't afford one
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:46.120]   Maybe that used abram's m1 and your driveways all you'd ever want. Oh now ralph laurin. I wear just covered the the tank tank tank takeovers
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.640]   Well, you know just you know, I won one parting shot
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:56.120]   Against the old model of advertising and in favor of the new if we ever get to the point where we have great contextual advertising
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.600]   And if it's really great
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:04.440]   Ads will tell me what I want before I know I want it and I'll generally want it and I would just buy it directly
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.280]   And I won't have to go to amazon.com just buy it from the ad and you know, we're getting there slowly
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.800]   That's google that is good. That is nirvana. Exactly and the opposite of that if we learn nothing from madmen
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:19.720]   We should have learned about the manufacturing of desire when you have a mass media that's going out to the whole world of every
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.960]   Type the person male female young old
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.560]   No matter what they're interested in in other words the old television model
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:32.040]   The way you advertise is you tell you convince people to want things they wouldn't otherwise want that's a manufacturing desire
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.880]   That's the old tv advertising all said and the future is when they
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.160]   I tell them what what I want
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:44.040]   Through my actions through my interest through what I do and then they give me what I want
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.560]   That's that's how it should work. I just hope that they figure out how to make it work
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:52.040]   Yeah, it's what I've said for years. We just want to tell people features and benefits of products
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.080]   Yeah
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.040]   Hopefully and by being niche broadcasting we have an advantage because we don't need to gather information on our audience
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:04.200]   Weird niche same kind of like the rob report the rob report knows they should advertise, you know tanks personal tanks
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:10.520]   Yeah, by the way, this this really looks good. Yeah, this luxury super tank. You can own it's a half track look at that
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.080]   There's nowhere I couldn't go
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.720]   I see one coming to petal loomer now
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.040]   These sons I can't believe you could buy this
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.800]   Moving on from the segue already
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.360]   Oh my god, I want it
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:28.760]   A tackle crush your second. Oh, by the way, it has doors that open like this
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   Not doors that open like the doors that open like this for the two comma club
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   Is is silicon is the tv show silicon valley gonna change our vocabulary? I think it is at least among a certain group
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.400]   Yeah doors that go like I want doors to go like this
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:49.080]   All right, we're gonna take a break. I wish I could sell you doors that go like this the new by the way the new uh tesla
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.320]   Yeah doors doors that go like that
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.000]   Nice
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.160]   They know what rich people want. That's right

[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.040]   Make sure your talent has talent talent you want talented talent you want on talent talent?
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.880]   Mm-hmm
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.360]   We get called talent, you know show hosts are called talent, but I think really anybody who's working in your company
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:45.880]   You should think of them that way. They're the talent right they're the brains. They're the the the people who make the difference in your company
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:53.480]   I've really liked that that was a line in the latest book about Steve Jobs becoming Steve Jobs
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.600]   uh the author
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:04.200]   Said that Steve Jobs understood that the company was one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century or maybe the
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.600]   I guess companies started in in Holland in the 17th century
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.880]   But the idea that a group of people would band together with a central purpose. Yeah
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.120]   uh
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:23.960]   Is so powerful and and instead of seeing apple as a hierarchy of the boss the managers the employees the grunts
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.360]   He saw it as a group of people
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:35.800]   With a united goal a united purpose and that's really you could see that in apples DNA can't you you can and and this is uh that that notion is
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.520]   you know is uh something that uh
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.000]   is you know
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.920]   People who are against unionization like the CEO of uh of Whole Foods for example is anti union
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.360]   Would would argue that that it's in fact unions that disrupt
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:57.400]   Uh the the sing singleness of purpose it pits management against well then the union becomes the purpose instead of the company
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:04.600]   Exactly now we have gawk gawkers unionized and now we have a whole bunch of writers from sites are trying to get together and and have a big
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.400]   meeting all get unionized and I just started turtling on twitter so fine so they all go on strike
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.320]   See i'm kind of a union guy. I know maybe i'm an old progress
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:20.120]   I'm an old line progressive. I just feel is there's no doubt that in the beginning of the 20th century union saved a working person
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:27.160]   Absolutely that was then they became their own their own. Yeah, maybe i'm not i'm not sure that there aren't
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.280]   um
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.280]   Industries who that need them
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:36.200]   Um, but I I do believe that many of the industries that did need them don't anymore and that they're kind of productive now
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.840]   So I think it's kind of an industry by industry thing
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:44.520]   But I think the the idea of of gawker employees like, you know screaming scab at the people who still want to
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.480]   Do blog posts is hilarious to me as well the giant inflatable rat. That's the one I like
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:53.160]   They put have you seen those jeff there out for some reason they're all over in new york
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.400]   I guess because there's a lot of hotel strikes and stuff going on in the york
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.240]   um
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.120]   Have you seen the darpa challenge blooper reel
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.840]   So the darpa challenge is so cool that it whoa
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:14.120]   This is almost identical to the russian police officer drunk
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:21.080]   Loopery, so what's cool is the darpa challenge which has been around for some years was originally about autonomous vehicles
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:26.120]   That's been solved. Yeah, I went to the first one. They were driving off the road. Just like this
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:30.040]   So now they've changed the challenge and it's kind of cool. They give you
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.960]   They give these these robots are not remote controlled. They're
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.600]   Autonomous they have to solve a real world problem and some of the problems are supplied at the
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.920]   You know right before the competition begins. Yeah, so you can't like write a lot of cool
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.480]   I'm getting empathy for machines here
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:50.840]   The sky apparently the skynet takeover is a little ways off
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.440]   I'm sorry it shouldn't laugh
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.520]   You you're right you shouldn't leo because when they realize that you're laughing at them
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.240]   And they can do something in 2015
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:11.240]   We noticed that you were mocking us. Yes. We're now will take you back behind the studio remember our our memory is forever
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:16.120]   Show you what we can do now. We never forget the if you want
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:21.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you want to know more about the darpa robotic challenge, I think it's still going on
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   It's the robotics challenge
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.440]   Dot org and what I love about this is the progress that they've made
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.560]   So you went to the first one. I went to the first one and the starting line was
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:39.400]   Unbelievable just you know 90 percent of the field just failed immediately. There was even they even had a motorcycle
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.040]   Uh, all they were trying to do is drive a road
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.560]   right they were trying to drive in a dirt road, you know, it's like is like 10 miles or something like that and
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.840]   Vast majority were just driving up on the edges and falling over and doing all this kind of stuff
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:58.600]   It was just it was such a difficult problem that now we take it for granted that is totally solvable and it's not a mate
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.680]   Not so long. What is it 10 years 15? It's not so so actually it is over
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.000]   Robots from the republic of korea and the united states won three and a half
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.560]   million dollars in prizes
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.240]   um
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:18.200]   The first place the two million dollar prize goes to team kai east of uh day john in the republic of korea
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.600]   Its robot was dr. C hubo
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:26.040]   Second place three a million dollars from penceacola, florida the robot running man
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:32.440]   We really should have been there. Yeah next year. Can we cover this? Yes, let's do that. Oh third prize. It's a hash challenge
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   Uh, um, so pitzburg got the third place half million dollar prize with its robot chimp
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.800]   23 teams you saw the robots they're big they're scary there they look human
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:50.520]   I mean put an honor sword snigger exoskeleton on them and you've got you know terminator the the idea on this one was
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.640]   Kind of inspired by the fukishima fukishima
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:59.960]   earthquake in japan the disaster in the nuclear plant that they actually had to send human sad human beings into
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:04.200]   Basically fatal situations that the the former should be human
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.440]   What's over there? You show there's a good reason to lakes and to worms the atlas people
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:13.240]   Now owned by google, uh had a good reason for that and that is that the world
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:17.960]   The human world is built for humans. So you know if you have a human shaped robot
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:23.480]   It can get into a car it can it can walk through a door it can go upstairs it can do all the things that are built for human beings
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:28.600]   You don't have an answer. So you want to hear the challenges? I don't know if I could do these there were eight tasks all related to
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.680]   Disaster response. Oh, it's fizzed. Does that one's gonna sound like to me? Well?
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.920]   If a car alone forget this autonomous vehicle, they're gonna have the robot get in the car now
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   You know why they're human and drive it
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.480]   Walking through rubble
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:46.760]   We saw some robots not do that well tripping circuit breakers
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:54.120]   So going up to a circuit breaker opening the box and flipping the switch turning valves climbing stairs covering a press conference
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:00.440]   Hosting a podcast. Yes, what that shouldn't be odd. No, hopefully they're falling over
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:05.640]   So that's you're asking a good question because I'd like to I'd like to do the next one and I don't know when the next one
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.160]   I'll find out. We'll make sure we cover it. It'd be so great to cover that
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.400]   Um
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.040]   Really fun. I want to see you. I want to see you interview a robot
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:18.600]   I think that's you know, well, okay. Well, that's the interesting question. So
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:24.760]   In the original DARPA challenge it was just driving a car autonomously which we solved
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:31.080]   In fact soon we'll be in them. Right. Uh this year it was robots flipping switches driving cars themselves
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.680]   What will it be in 10 15 years? What will we be asking those robots to do?
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.480]   Very human like tasks. I would guess
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:43.080]   Nanny robot nannies nannies maybe yeah, there's no reason for them to host talk shows. Thank god
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.800]   No, uh, they wouldn't waste their precious time. Yeah, they've got better things to do
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.520]   That'll be the challenge come up with the reason to host a talk show
[00:59:53.400 --> 01:00:01.000]   Good lord. Um, I just so by the way that video is uh on the discovery magazine's website
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.480]   And let me see if I could find it for you so I can uh
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.240]   So because I know you want to share this with all your families and friends
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:13.560]   This this is the mark hand greasy line too is is the first half of the of the
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:19.960]   dialectic is robots or that hasn't worked it's never gonna work. It's just awful and the next one is robots work too well
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.760]   It's gonna get a little wrong. I think we're getting close to that frankly
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:30.280]   Yeah, uh, this is a very good story today, which I put up about about how self-driving trucks are going to hit the auto industry
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.720]   Really? I mean the truck in trucking industry. Yeah, really
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:40.280]   1 and a half percent of the workforce works at driving whether it's driving a taxi or driving a truck
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:47.400]   Those people I think are threatened in the next decade. Yeah, those jobs. That's a lot of jobs. Yep
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:55.640]   Uh, this is discover magazine not discovery the tv network. Uh, the most epic robot fails of the DARPA robotics
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:04.360]   Uh challenge. This is my favorite one somebody made an anime to give robots standing in the door and just says I don't know
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:10.360]   I know i'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh i'm in deep trouble
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.840]   Even that uh
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.000]   Do you want to see the some of the winners?
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:20.040]   Yeah, here is uh, this is the uh case to the the um korean robot
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.480]   The challenge again getting in a car and driving it. I mean that's kind of mind-boggling
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.520]   Yeah, that a robot could get in a car
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.720]   And successfully drive it right?
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.600]   Um, there's the robot. I guess
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.720]   He's already in the car
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.960]   Look, he's holding his hat for some reason. He's got a hand on his hat
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.760]   I was such a headache. That's really I don't want to my hat to fall off
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:52.680]   Look at this. Uh, oh, is he gonna hit that? He's got to go. Oh, see that's to really pilot it. Holy cow
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.600]   Wow
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.640]   So here's here's something scary that's also google related
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.840]   We're talking about how I went to the original grand challenge. It was in 2004
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.960]   2004 Jason I put it in the rundown. I colored it pink
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:11.960]   But I searched for DARPA in google photos and it found them. Yeah, how did your pictures? How did it recognize?
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.160]   Uh
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.480]   The DARPA grand challenge using the word DARPA's robots are smarter than us already. That's incredible
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.640]   So these are some of my my robot ride side saddle. Is he gonna get out? Look at that
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:27.320]   He does exactly what he's supposed to do again. I want to emphasize this there's nobody human remote controlling this robot
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.200]   Yeah
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.920]   That robot did it by himself or itself
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.120]   Do you want to see him getting out of the vehicle? This is fun
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:40.440]   This is the winner one one a big prize to two million dollars. I'm sure most of that money
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.320]   Was well spent already spent. Yeah
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:48.920]   Before they won it. So now he has to get out of his roo raises his hand off the wheel
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:54.840]   Turns very careful by the way. Notice he rode side saddle. Why bother getting your legs in there?
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.880]   Uh, I guess except for the accelerator pedal
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:03.480]   It's not like they're running but remember this is 11 years ago cars were driving off the road. Yeah
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.840]   It's amazing. It's only 11 years. Yeah
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   This is why I want to live forever
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.880]   If if self-driving cars had robots and then we probably feel more comfortable
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.960]   Oh, yeah, right and you know son of phyme johnny cab. Yeah, exactly. You're in a johnny cab
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.240]   Wow, he's grasping the frame. Yeah
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:30.120]   Remember this huge computation going on at this point. There's no they have to figure out where they are what they're doing
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.200]   what they need
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   they were not um
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.480]   They were not given a road map of the vehicle or where they were going to go ahead of time
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:44.200]   This is all in response to the environmental stimulus. Of course otherwise it's useless
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.000]   They have to make sure they don't flash their underwear to the paparazzi
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.680]   Very complicated computationally. So this is an antidote. Wow. Look at this an antidote to
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:04:00.440]   The robots we saw for yeah, and you can see why they fell over. This is not easy. Right. Look at this. He's good
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.840]   Yeah, he bends his knees. Always want to shift
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.960]   Oh my god
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.080]   It's not exactly going to chase you like the terminator, but
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.600]   Uh, but you you can see just those of us who are
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:21.320]   Intuitively familiar with more is law that this will just get faster and accurate and point where they'll be able to get out of the car and like
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.960]   Faster than actually yeah
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.000]   In other words perfect actually we only have a little bit right uh, there's only a little window of opportunity for us
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.600]   Meet meet sex. Well, I mean we can have our brains transplanted
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.320]   Transplant it into a jar that sits on top of the robots body. I feel like that's a separate track
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:42.760]   I kind of want those tracks maybe get when we do that in parallel because I feel like
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.040]   One's getting a little bit ahead of the other at this point and uh
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.360]   I don't feel like that the the brain container is going to be here in time
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:55.720]   Look at that. I want my brain container to have like oculus rift like lash to the outside of the jar
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.120]   So that I can just live live in virtual reality. Look how stable that is. Yeah, it's amazing
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:06.280]   All right, DARPA grand challenge. It's over. There's the winner. There's your winner right there
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.240]   His name is hubo
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.800]   And he'll be knocking on your door in 15 minutes
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.680]   We're 11 years. So it was only 11 years ago. These cars are driving off the road
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.440]   You know, I I've been using a new uh service that uh is being tested in san francisco called lux l u x e
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.840]   I can't wait. It's fantastic. It's fantastic
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.760]   Wait, look at hubo got on his knees. I don't know what's going on. He's a he's a muslim
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.120]   He's
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.360]   He knows which way he's mac i could get built in why is huba? Oh, he's got wheels
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.760]   Oh, it's son of a gun. We're in deep trouble folks
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.440]   We are in deep deep trouble. That's really cool
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.160]   But anyway, luck's for those of you unfamiliar with the services
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.680]   It's kind of like uber except they use your car instead of theirs
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.960]   Basically, what you do is you go to you go to san francisco
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.160]   Uh, I'll drive in there. We're parking is hugely expensive
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.400]   It's really difficult to park it's expensive and you know, and so you just go wherever you want
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.720]   You you say i'm going to be at this place in about five minutes. They meet you there
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.360]   They are either on a scooter or a skateboard. They have a little blue
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.800]   Jackets, i saw a guy hanging out with a blue jacket
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.240]   Yes, they're just hopping the they just hop in the car and drive your car away
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.520]   And you do whatever you're going to do and then when you want you summon it just like uber
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.000]   And they come and you they get out
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.640]   But mike, you know that one. I don't know something kind of
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:28.120]   That's you kind of trust the guy in the blue jacket. Well, that's one part of it and almost seemed like this is
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:34.360]   I don't know there's some progressive part of me that says this is like taking a homeless guy and saying
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.400]   They just drive my car around till I need it again. I hope that that's not but that's what people think about
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.680]   Not criticizing i'm not criticizing you like i'm trying to imagine myself using this and it makes sense
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.800]   But then i'm thinking what is there's i can't figure out what it is. There's something a little off about the concept
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:56.120]   It feels elitist because basically what you're doing is you're turning the whole city into into a into a
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.600]   Valet parking service. Well, they have their own lots. Yeah, they will wash your car
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.680]   If you ask them to you pay them, of course, I should have asked them to get my cars filthy
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:12.280]   And uh, they are insured. So if they do run off with your car, you have it or crash it. Yeah, you know what it is
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.080]   See I despise valet parking when I go to california make fun of it
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:21.480]   I ridicule it. I park around the but I despise it. It's very california thing to have
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.840]   valet parking but here's the best part of lukes
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.960]   But it's but it but it's it makes material sense. So if you go to new york city and you want to park your cars
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.520]   With any of that right there's a there's a so here's how you get on the valet team
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:40.520]   They say 15 to 25 dollars an hour. You keep everything you've earned and that doesn't include tips. I bet you tipped them
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.400]   Uh, no insurance gas or hidden fees for you have to jog scooter or skate
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:50.280]   Skateboard around san francisco to meet customers stay in shape as you explore the city
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:57.160]   Well, see but see the cool thing is the hourly rate on lukes is less than any parking garage in san francisco
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.960]   In fact, you can keep it overnight for an extra 10 bucks. So for 25
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   They they'll keep your car for 24 hours, which is like 60 or 70 bucks in any hotel in san francisco
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.760]   But but the point the reason I brought it up is that this service
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.560]   Obviously these guys are going to be replaced by robots in five years
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.920]   The robots are going to come in across you know why because autonomous cars are going to eliminate the need for these guys
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.440]   That's right. We won't even own vehicles. It's right now in san francisco, la
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:26.520]   Chicago, seattle and boston I found out about it because our travel guy johnny jet told me and I haven't had a
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.120]   Occasion to use it yet, but I I plan on it. This is the uberfication of everything. Yep. Yep
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.840]   But I'll tell you
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:40.680]   This model is going to succeed and the reason is it feels so damn good to use it like we you know
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.760]   We I've been to the city in places where you just you can't park
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.720]   And it's crowded in this rush hour and it says a hassle
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.960]   We just want to go to a restaurant have a nice meal and then leave
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:55.800]   And you just go pull up right in front of the door of the restaurant get out and just walk into the restaurant
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.600]   It's so well now here. All right. Here's my question like so
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.080]   Is there gonna be a war between valets? Well, we actually had a war
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.920]   My son and I he came from silicon valley. I came down from petaluma
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:12.840]   We we all had dinner in san francisco and we set it up to where he put it in and we pushed the button at the same time
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.960]   The race my guy blew his away by about 10 minutes
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.200]   But uh, yeah, your guy was on a same thing. Well, no, you're gonna you're gonna pull up for a rest
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.120]   That has its own valet parking and instead you're gonna have your valet
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.360]   Exactly. It's who of them. We're gonna get into a fight
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.240]   Yes, and and then that's why we have a smartphone so we can video that
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:38.360]   On youtube it's part of the circle of life google announced on friday that they will start putting accident reports on their
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.760]   self-driving car blog
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.920]   Yeah, they've been you know, they've been kind of harassed into this. I think uh,
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.720]   the
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.080]   Originally at a shareholders meeting on wednesday, sir gay brin said
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:56.760]   We don't need to reveal accident details. Nothing can be perfect. Our goal is to just be better than humans
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.800]   Um on the other hand, uh, they've been getting a lot of pressure for consumer watchdog and others
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.560]   Um that they really need to tell us how reliable these are obviously parents. He's always smarter
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.440]   Yeah, you might as well. He looks like you're hiding something if you don't right
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.320]   Um all the accidents they've reported so far were the fault of other drivers
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.120]   Not the cautious driverless cars
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:22.920]   Or or I think at least one case it was the google driver
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.760]   Who got in to the driverless car and decided to drive it himself
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.280]   Rear-end crashes are the most frequent accidents in america
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.800]   Not much you can do about that. I've been rear-ended a couple of times
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.160]   Usually from an idiot looking at his phone usually a human always a human
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.480]   We've been hit from behind seven times mainly at traffic lights, but also in the freeway
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.400]   We've been side swiped a couple of times and hit by a car rolling through a stop sign
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.160]   Here's what we don't know from the reporting that google has done on accidents
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.360]   We don't know how many accidents would have happened had the driver not taken over control
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:03.720]   So so let's say an accident is about to happen the driver does what he's supposed to do takes control of the vehicle and prevents an accident
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:09.720]   And then no accident happened no accident is reported and and we so we don't know how safe
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.520]   Right if I it's there's a big difference between having a professional driver in the front seat paying attention
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.200]   Whose job is to make sure there's no accident and me snapping in the back of my car
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.280]   I can't wait it's itself. This is at least they've got the transparency. This is the first report
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:26.200]   This was from the month of may they tell you a lot. They've got 23 lexus
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.440]   These on public streets mainly Mountain View nine prototypes
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.720]   Mostly self-driving on closed test tracks
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.840]   1 million autonomous miles
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:44.280]   796 000 miles in manual mode 10 000 autonomous miles a week per a public street
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.400]   Um, so this is the report you could show this uh Jason. I don't think this is
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.120]   Secrets
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.320]   Interesting situation of the month. I'm gonna read this every month
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:00.680]   I want to get this is a like a newspaper self-driving cars are good at keeping track of multiple moving objects at once
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:07.560]   Skills that were on display in this situation involving two cyclists the two red right rectangles here
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.040]   Let me make this a little bit bigger
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.000]   So you can see it those two red rectangles are cyclists
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:20.120]   The red trails behind them show the path so this cyclist is wobbly going from the center
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.360]   Lane into the right lane. This cyclist is going in the opposite direction
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.360]   both
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.640]   The cyclists on left had entered the left turn lane, but veered back into our path to continue to turn straight across the intersection
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:37.160]   He changed his mind. I was gonna turn left. I think I'll drive straight at the same time the cyclist on the right entered the intersection
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.400]   Traveling against the flow of traffic
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.240]   The cyclist that cyclist then took a sudden left turn
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.160]   Coming directly at us in our lane our car was able to predict the cyclist's path of travel
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.960]   That's the turquoise line that the car thought the cyclists were going to take of course going right through the car
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.960]   So we stopped and yielded this happened at night
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.400]   It would have been very difficult for the human driver to see what was unfolding
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:08.440]   I they're gonna do this every month. I love this and in other news. We'd like to announce so we're inventing the self-driving bicycle. I think they need it
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:15.160]   Isn't this great that you actually could see the the map of data. Yeah that the cars got
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:21.720]   I want to know did it ever what was there? What was it? Robby the robot or who was the that was not compute does not compute
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:28.200]   Uh, that was it. Yeah, that's lost in space lost in space. Yeah. Yeah, what was his name? What was it?
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.320]   Uh, the robot there was mr. Smith. This is a job
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   For the ultimate moment for the chat room. Yeah, chat room the name of the robot and lost in space and every by the way
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.800]   Here's every accident documented
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:46.120]   So here's what I want to know does the self-driving car ever hit a point of overload and say does not compute
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.080]   I can't I can't do this. That's what happened in this one. It just stopped
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:55.160]   It said you know what? I don't know what these idiots are gonna do right. I'm just gonna stop and yield. Yeah, I'm a darlinius
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.240]   This is let this solve itself. Yeah
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.520]   Now that's when they get rebranded by the way
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:08.040]   Why did you stop in the middle of the street? They're all the accidents one by one described
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.160]   Uh, then they have this is good what we've been reading
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:16.360]   The Atlantic City Labs googles the articles about the cars. This is a little newsletter
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.000]   It even has a little graphics describing how we've been doing this month
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.720]   That's gonna be on the self-driving car page. Well, I want to know too is is there like a new monthly challenge?
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.120]   How do they set the goals? You know, oh, we got to take it into snow
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.520]   Yeah, I don't know when do they consider ready?
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.440]   Bridges in the metal, you know, what what other things that it can't do?
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:46.200]   Well, okay, if I have a choice between the google self-driving car and the self-driving car from delphi auto parts
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.760]   I know I'm gonna take the what about what about the the run down. What about the buy do slash bmw
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:59.080]   So yeah, I don't know about the buy do self-driving BMW
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.880]   I guess people don't know technology so it has to go with somebody and of course
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.680]   I can't go with a california because Audi already did it
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.200]   So if Audi does it bmw's got to do it
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.760]   Um apparently the official thing. Oh my god
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.200]   The official name of the robot in lost the space was robot b9, but he was always just referred to as
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.920]   robot mostly by mr. Smith
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:31.160]   And and the the creator apparently i'm i'm seeing this uh searching for this is robert uh kino shita who died at the age of 100 this year
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:38.680]   No, really? Yeah, he created he was a tv and film art director robert kino shita
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:44.680]   And he created the robot he came up with a danger. Well robinson line danger danger will robinson
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.760]   And he lived to be a hundred I have every one of those uh robot sound effects from lost in space on my other
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:56.120]   His lines have outlived him. Yes, someone in the chat room when I asked the question said i'm not 60. I don't know
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:02.840]   It's coming
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.480]   It's depressing
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.920]   I'm so impressed you wait you wait you wait your kids will be saying the same thing about hodor you'll be laughing your head
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:14.120]   That's right hodor this hodor that
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.360]   Criminy who just get into this century?
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.400]   So a guy tweeted a
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.200]   um
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:28.440]   Couple weeks ago saying that his daughter asked him why do we say hang up the phone? Oh and he said I feel like i'm 92
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.200]   Yeah
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.200]   dial and hang up are both uh
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   Right completely archaic
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.600]   Google will not receive transaction fees for android pay
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.480]   As apple does for apple pay
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.200]   But not because they didn't want to
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.720]   But only because rules have been changed
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.440]   the card issuers
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.320]   Standardized security system means they won't get revenue
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.600]   The apple made their deals like a year ago
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:03.080]   And the banks were all afraid that they miss out on the big opportunity and so they allowed themselves to be
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.920]   Negotiated into this point where they're they're paying apples and then by the time google got around to it
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.840]   They're like we're not paying for that. What are you kidding?
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.360]   We were locked in for three years with apple, but as soon as that's over we're going to read negotiate
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.760]   And you need us so
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:22.600]   The poor google went went said hey we just want the same deal you have app with apple and they're like now
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.080]   We don't even want the one we have the apple to hear that
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.840]   Poor google
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.320]   Everybody wants the deal that apple has with anything
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:34.440]   Yeah, apple is not afraid to exercise. It's a considerable market cloud
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.880]   And it's very good effective doing at getting that done
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.360]   Um
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.520]   Oh, by the way, if you're an android user don't get all excited about apple music you won't get it till this fall
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.280]   Sorry
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.880]   Still i don't understand why because the beats app is an is on android
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.160]   They have to hire some people who know how to program for for android first
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.720]   It's apple's first android product. Yeah, so is it really it is
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.440]   They have never done an android ever
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:05.240]   Interesting yeah
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.240]   Maybe they'll like it
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.240]   They're like hey, this is great. We should do more
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.080]   No, it's not gonna happen
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.160]   They've always been cross-platform with music though. iTunes was on windows very early
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:24.280]   Um, so you can't not do that. Yeah, although steve jobs fought it right to right his uh, basically his team said no, it's steve
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.560]   You got you got to have a windows version, but it was good
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:35.000]   They did because it only took a few months before the vast majority of ipod buyers were windows users not a not a mac and touch users
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.520]   Uh, but they didn't learn that lesson in a way. Did they no?
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:46.600]   I mean if you look at it's so important to apple apple music succeed. I think yeah, um that they should have really had the uh android version ready
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.960]   I don't
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:52.680]   We we're talking about developing an app for uh twit using our api
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.440]   It does take a while we're the developers we've been talking to
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.080]   It'll say it'll be about 80 thousand dollars and it will be ready at christmas
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.200]   And you know what lio i'll bet some great fan will beat him to it and do a better job
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.360]   Perhaps I know some great fan will beat him to it to me tree leon who wrote the windows phone?
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:17.240]   I already said i'm gonna do a windows version a universal windows version windows 10 windows phone xbox one version
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:21.240]   I'm gonna open source it and I bet the demetries typing right now aren't you demetries?
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560]   We gave them access to the api
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:27.640]   You know the api on the new website was supposed to launch tomorrow. I'm known with some hiccups
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.840]   Not our fault not for kitchens fault, but uh with our some server certs and stuff
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:39.480]   Um, but when it launches there will be a public api that'll launch with it and I get a lot of requests from our
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:44.840]   Audience they for instance the one number one request that we get that we cannot we do not fulfill
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:49.880]   Why don't you have your rss feeds include every show you've ever done?
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:57.640]   Which is I think in my opinion a fundamental under misunderstanding what rss is the feeds are supposed to tell you there's a new show
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.480]   In fact there are people like this american life the feed has one show in it the current it well, but it's the poor man's api
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:10.360]   But that's what they've got right is the feed so they're saying well can you give us a feed with all 511 security now shows
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.640]   It would cost us so much money because the feed file would be one and a half megabytes
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:22.200]   Most podcast clients check every hour to see if there's an update because really what the feeds about is what's the new show
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.360]   And we have 70,000
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.120]   Downloaders or subscribers on security now so 70,000
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.000]   Mega no i'm sorry 105,000 megabytes an hour
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.680]   Yeah, uh, that's 100 terabytes an hour
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.920]   Every hour of every day would kill would we be out of business?
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:47.800]   But the new api so what i want to do and i think we'll do this is where i want to create a page of snippets page on our wiki
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.800]   with little
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.400]   Program snippets new api would make a trivial to write a little program in python or ruby or whatever that would just say
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.800]   Download all security now and then you go for a cup of coffee and then you're gonna have all the shows yeah
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:03.000]   So we'll so that's how we're gonna fulfill that request
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.360]   We shouldn't recommend that people do that because that's gonna be huge
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.640]   Well, I guess somebody real some people do for some reason. That's the one show. Nobody says can I have every episode?
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.160]   Oh, or tech news. I'm gonna know what the breaking news was two years again
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:15.960]   Yeah, nobody cares
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.560]   But security now is really about teaching you about yeah computers and security and
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.560]   There's a lot of schools use it professors use it in classes and so forth
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.600]   So I can talk me into it. I want them all yeah, you should have them all
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.160]   What we should really do is sell a uh
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.640]   DVD set
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.560]   Yes, or just ask the nsa that's right
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.600]   Uh, any other stories here google's now on tap finds in and answers
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:46.840]   We talked about that before I think if you have you played with the new touch to search feature in in mobile chrome
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:56.280]   No, is it already out? It's out. It's out. I have it so so when I when I um, you know go to a web page where your name is on it
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.960]   Yeah
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:04.040]   Tap on your name and hold down and it pulls up a search request based on that wow in context
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.960]   See if it works for you and android. Do you have an android phone with you?
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:14.840]   No, I haven't I'm so embarrassed mike and I are both using iPhones. Oh, I'm ashamed of you out out
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:21.080]   The shop taking it over the show decided it was it's a little pretty fickle of me to have an android phone
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:28.840]   And an android where watch during twig but where an iphone and i apple watch during mac pree quickly. We need to i need to be consistent
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:35.160]   mr. Howl mr. Howl. Do you have an android phone? I know you do i might
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:40.520]   Let's take over the show Jason just turn off their cameras. It's yours in mind
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   Oh lord
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.160]   They are the all the port danger the old report
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.200]   Warning warning
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.960]   Uh, no, I'm you know
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:56.200]   I actually have rapidly covered the conclusion that smart watches in general and the apple watch specifically is our dopey
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:01.320]   And I and I don't I don't want to wear them anymore, but I feel like I can't we'll get to that in a second
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.640]   But uh, so Jason do you have is working for you?
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.280]   That's what i'm trying to do right now so far. I'm not so what do you do?
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.280]   Take it over hosting the show now because it describes this posture in the host chair
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:15.800]   Just cry on this theory. How do you do it? What are you? Yeah? Yeah, it's okay. So it's working. Um here
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.520]   Let me see. I'm not sure if you're gonna. What's he supposed to do to see it?
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.920]   All you basically is yeah, it's hard to show but basically I selected
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:29.000]   Spotify and the wall of text and down at the bottom step low is this little contextual thing that rose up
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.400]   So I can scroll up on that. Oh, that's the now on tab. There we go. That's a search
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.120]   So when I hit web page all you do is mark a word and it will create a search query, right?
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.440]   Right there
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.440]   It's wonderful. Here's a yeah
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:48.200]   Here's another miraculous thing apple can't do that. Well, here's something you can do on apple that is actually a google feature
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.240]   It's the location based search and it includes voice search. This is amazing. Check this out
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.480]   I'm gonna do a google now. Yeah, this is cool. This is the coolest thing. Okay, so here we go
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.760]   What is the address of this place?
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.840]   Which place did you mean?
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.560]   And it's given me three of the things in the neighborhood. It could be enough. Yeah, because it doesn't know exactly
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:14.760]   And we'll get to the we'll get to the um, okay, so it's give me the address of twit now
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:20.760]   Now check this out now. I'm gonna go back to the search and now I've told I've told it where you are. Yeah, and now I'm gonna say
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.720]   What is the phone number of this place?
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:34.360]   It doesn't say it. It just shows you don't have a phone. See is 800 605 89 4 8. Wow. Yeah, so
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:41.560]   Basically depending so it takes the little key. That's the right phone. Yeah. Yeah, and so this is fantastic. I don't even have a phone number
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.360]   Nobody answers it right
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.240]   Don't get me wrong. We're gonna create an API where you can call with your
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.920]   You'll get a you'll get my voice saying what do you want?
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:25:00.760]   Now that also works with um like landmarks, so say you're outside court tower and you actually don't know what court tower is you can say
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:07.080]   What do you know? What is this place in front of me and it'll say that's quite tower. So it'll identify so is that kind of now on tap
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:15.560]   Early release because now on tap because Chris could do google now now. Yeah, so it's context. Yeah, it's the power of context. Yeah
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.800]   Which which by the way is data its privacy?
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.680]   tower
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.120]   Oh
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.080]   Well, I uh, I can't wait. That's exactly it's exciting. Yeah, uh, also
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.040]   Android tv
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:37.800]   I bought the uh, Nvidia shield android tv installed it in my home. I like it
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.240]   Uh, it's a little it feels limited because it for instance the first thing you do is download Netflix
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.480]   It didn't come with Netflix. It doesn't have amazon which bugs me
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:52.120]   But it does have hulu. It's very nice in the goog if you live in the google world google music
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:55.560]   I can play through my stereo because it's part of my home theater system
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:03.960]   Uh, it feels fairly snappy, but it's really android. It really feels like android the store though will only show you tv appropriate apps much like google tv did
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.440]   couple of years back
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.760]   Uh, but apparently there are 600 of those tv apps
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:17.080]   Uh, you can browse them and and find them a lot of games mostly. I would say almost all games
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.640]   Um, I immediately installed cross-e-road kind of fun to play cross-e-road
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   Oh, I'm at 70 inch screen
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:29.800]   That's kind of fun and it works it comes the shield comes with a game controller not the remote
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.560]   So you're playing with a game controller. I think you can get a remote. That's right
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.080]   Both of the both the controller and their mo you could talk to directly so I think everything's gonna be speech-enabled
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080]   I think they'll have to have different names though, right?
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.480]   Uh, because otherwise they're all gonna respond
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:49.320]   Uh more have a sensor in them that detects that you're holding it. Maybe therefore that's the way you intend
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320]   I think in fact, that's the plan for some of these yeah
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:57.080]   Um, and and it's going to become so ubiquitous that we're gonna all have to be very careful about what we say
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.120]   On our shows because we're going to be triggering all this voice stuff that happened to me the other day
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.720]   I know my I was taught we were talking about the amazon echo and I can't say
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:11.320]   And her her amazon echo launched into it fortunately. She's the only person in the world that has one
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.840]   But right but but people are going to have the you know google now they're gonna have syri
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.040]   They're gonna have all this stuff. It's gonna be a big problem
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.880]   So what we do now is we have different names like syri's real name is the name
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.320]   And you will have to start publishing a guide. Yeah slomo
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:32.200]   So we say hey slomo and like yeah, uh, I think we decided that amazon's echo name wouldn't be a l ex a
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.280]   But uh, I don't know what we decided what do we decide we had a name
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.440]   Uh, what if we call her, uh, alberta
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:47.560]   And then google now we don't have to worry about that, but you can't say okay google. Oh god. I just did i'm so sorry
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.920]   Uh, my xbox is xbox. So if I say well for you all say syri, uh, syri
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:02.600]   No, slomo. Oh, yeah. Hello sailor. That's what dr. Mom calls her al xa is sailor say a sailor
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:10.280]   The problem is you can't the the echo you can't you can't you only have two choices amazon or the right or the other name
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.400]   Yeah
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.400]   The problem with that also is it's just the name. There's no hey. Yeah, right?
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:23.000]   So if you just say her name, but the hey thing that the syri has now is just really dumb. I feel it it feels like hey syri
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.720]   So you know why they do it the same reason google has a multiple slabble
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:37.320]   Uh, oh, huh? Okay, four syllables, right? Um, hey syri is not enough because uh, frankly my syri
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:42.360]   If I have my iphone plugged in this turned on it wakes up for tv shows it wakes up in the middle of the night
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.240]   I don't know because I'm snoring hey syri. I don't know and then
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:51.400]   Uh, so the longer the better I have actually made my uh, my phone my moto xa. Okay. Well help me
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.440]   Obi-Wan Kenobi and that one it never went off by accident
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:01.880]   So false triggers are giving a big problem. You didn't add your my only hope to no I thought that's a little too long
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.920]   Okay
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.240]   a little too long apple tv has
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.280]   If they had apps 70 apps
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.720]   Roku has 2000 apps fire tv 1700 apps
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:23.080]   So google has a little catch enough to do yeah android tv also just um did something that they've needed to do since they launched and updated the play store
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.200]   so now
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:32.520]   Um, now you can find all the android tv apps on android tv before it was like it was curated list and right you knew there were more out
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.240]   There because if you went on the web you can install things to it
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.160]   Uh, now you can find it all through android tv. This is interesting the next version of android will give app publishers the ability
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:45.080]   To program linear tv channels that is live streaming
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:50.200]   Uh, well not live's not the right word, but you could watch h you could watch uh, abc. Yeah
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:54.120]   Um, that's good for us. That means a twit app could be
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:57.720]   On the you could watch twit that way. Yeah
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:01.960]   All right, so if I go to the play.google.com
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.760]   And I search for tv
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.720]   What do I search for? Oh mo- no apps
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:14.680]   Yeah apps. Yeah, I'm not sure that there is a category specific for android tv. Um, do you see one boo?
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.040]   I don't see one
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.040]   pretend to play
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.680]   Should I click that I would not
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:28.920]   It's in the family block. Is that pony play? What is that? Okay, that's something else then comes with a safe word
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.280]   Okay
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:43.160]   So I get on the on the shield though that it will give me a yeah, you'll get a list of only the things that are android tv
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.400]   Yeah, you can't see anything that's not right. Yeah, you know what I'd love to see google do
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.400]   Uh, and jeff what would google do?
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.240]   Um, I'd love to see
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.880]   So microsoft today unveiled the more details about their service hub
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.000]   And the microsoft service hub is a
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:05.000]   Beautiful product. It is a stunningly good product perfect for its purpose
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.840]   And you know we can go into that. I'm sure you guys went into that
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.760]   And are going to go into additional detail on that on on windows weekly, but
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.480]   Uh, I would love to see google spearhead
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:22.840]   The consumerization of something like the service hub in other words and and imagine an android tv that was a that was a 4k
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.400]   touch display with two
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:31.480]   HD cameras lots of sensors where you can interact with it and a whiteboard kind of thing play games that
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.560]   Were you touch the screen or maybe you don't touch the screen?
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.120]   But I would love to see the tv
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:42.360]   Uh, the tv be replaced by something that is a very high resolution touch display like the service hub
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.440]   I think consumer we're gonna
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:50.280]   We're gonna buy a surface hub fantastic. Uh, they are really for the shows right or
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.920]   Yeah, no, not for my house because
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.400]   I'd like to show you a PowerPoint presentation. That's right
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.000]   But you've been having trouble sleeping lately. So i'm going to show you a power bill
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.320]   No, but they're set they're expensive. So the 55 inches 7 000. Yes, the 85 inches 20 000
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:13.400]   Yes, but it is a thing of beauty. I saw it in septus going friday. It is just
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:20.520]   I mean, it's just it's so good. It's so high. We love this in classes, right? Yes, absolutely
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:26.760]   Yeah, it's I think classes are actually classes in board rooms or meeting rooms conference rooms are really where this is designed
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.840]   But for education, I love to see the android version because I think they could get the price down
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.720]   I mean microsoft is building this in Oregon and it's a it's a it's a it's a good price
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.800]   You know, they make a compelling case about how the things that it replaces
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:43.480]   It's far cheaper than the things that it replaces the projector and all the rest
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.080]   But but it's still 20, you know, $20,000 a lot of money
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:52.040]   I'd love to see google spearhead a project where all these different tv
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:58.040]   You know sony and sam's on these different companies are competing with each other on price to get that down under $10 000 for the big 80
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.280]   There's a sam's lung version of this
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:08.040]   I saw it at the ephone Berlin. I that's funny because I saw it on tv in hasa cart
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:16.200]   Remember that really phony scene where the guys got a sam sum tablet and he says well, let's just put it up on the big screen
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.880]   He goes like this and swipes the tablet and goes was that house of cars?
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.160]   I think I thought it was something something one of those I saw it on tv
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:28.840]   Yeah, but this uh the the uh microsoft phone runs windows 10. What is the sam's song run?
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.720]   Must run android right?
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:39.000]   There are versions there are things from in focus. There's an in focus product is there's oh sure and they run windows 7
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.680]   And they're vastly less elegant vastly less integrated
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.440]   They just surface hub is there's nothing like it. It's way better than well anything else
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.600]   We've tried since tech tv days to get you know, I mean there's been devices like that
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   Yeah, they had special pens and stuff
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:58.360]   But the problem was shooting them on camera was hard because yeah the lights in a television studio in those days had to be so bright
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.680]   Yeah, that the tv would get washed out
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:05.000]   But you see it on cnn and all the time they're always doing this stuff like that's something important right?
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.080]   Um, yeah, I'm thinking I don't know what we put it on a stand
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.320]   They make a whole bunch of they make a plethora of stands you can take your picks including ones on rollers
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:20.520]   They have a that's what we'd have to do. The fundamental stand has rollers on it and it would you know, it'd be perfect
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:25.560]   For so we could roll it behind you for tech news tonight. You could today rather you could yeah
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.360]   You could tap it or something. So here's here's an example of how it's contextual
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:35.000]   You you basically walk up to it and and there are apps that you know, for example the main app
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.360]   Which is uh one note
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:41.080]   We'll have controls on one side and they're right there and you can tap the controls and then right on the whiteboard and stuff like that
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.240]   When you walk to the other side the controls move over to
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.920]   Oh nice another person comes up two sets of controls up here on that's nice
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.480]   You have the the Skype connections are all stacked on one side
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.880]   So you could have 10 people on a line very and the surface hub would handle all those connections
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.040]   It's just so good. It's just so good
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:01.560]   Let us uh take a break because I think we've I unless there's some news that we haven't mined jeff is there a story
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.920]   so
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:05.240]   Jeff, no mic anything that we we didn't uh
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.720]   I mean, I you know, I jumped around a lot. Yep
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.800]   But uh, you know this one of the things I love about this show is it's very informal
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.520]   Uh, there's really no structure to it and we kind of does talk about whatever the hell we want to talk about
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.240]   It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:23.240]   Laugh is like a box of chocolates
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:27.240]   We uh, okay get your picks ready
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:31.080]   Our show today brought to you by a really great company brain tree
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:33.560]   You know, I asked i'm starting to see the other day
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:40.440]   I said are you named after brain tree massachusetts? He said not exactly we're actually in chicago and sephrancesco
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:46.760]   But the fat one of the founders was a was a fan of I think john adam's a president born in brain tree
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.200]   huh, and so he thought oh it's a good name for a company that has
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:55.720]   brains and shakes the money tree or whatever. I don't know anyway, it's a great name for a company you can
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.280]   Forget it and it's very cool
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.160]   Because what brain tree does if you're a mobile app developer with a few lines of code is give you
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.160]   a
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.520]   secure

[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.840]   Basically, that's the beauty part of this you as a developer don't have to worry about it
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:37.320]   They add the features they make it seamless. They make it magical. No wonder companies like uber
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.840]   use brain tree payments
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:46.520]   Because you know for uber that what is the selling point for uber? There's two you push a button somebody comes
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:50.600]   Number two you get out of the car and you're paid that's brain tree

[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.320]   github munchry living social i bet you luksal uses it i don't know but i mean

[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.520]   um

[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:42.360]   Uh, and your and more importantly, maybe even your customers will love it
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.600]   As a developer you'll like the ease of use your customers will
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.320]   Just the one touch
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.600]   Checkout means they don't have to enter a credit card number
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.800]   They don't have to mess around you get far fewer people abandoning their shopping carts
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.360]   braintree payments dot com slash
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.880]   twig
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:07.720]   I am a believer and and you know you use it. You already use it. You lose it all the time probably right? Yeah
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.840]   Uh, you might not know that but you do
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:15.240]   And that's funny because I use the whole list, you know, it's like airbnb
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:20.040]   Everybody and and and though it but to me that's the selling point, right? Exactly
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.800]   That's the thing about uber is that the payment is non-existent. You don't even think about it
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.240]   Get out of the car
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:29.720]   But it informs you about how much it is about and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, it's it's really bad
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.880]   But I think that's a selling point friction free, right?
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.840]   Uh, I'll give you a little uh
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.240]   Tool in absence of uh a tip from jina trapani
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:45.560]   This is actually the reason i'm mentioning this is it comes from google google supported this research at the cornel
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.200]   lab of ornethology
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.680]   If you've ever been a birder
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.520]   Or you just look out in your backyard and you go, what the hell is that bird?
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:01.320]   the merlin bird id app for google play or the uh, ios app store
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.840]   well
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:09.320]   Let you take a picture or feed a picture or even go through a checklist of 400 north of berniken birds and
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.720]   Determine what that bird is
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.800]   Our birders gonna love this or hate this
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.200]   Uh, well birders probably don't need it if you're like a really sophisticated burger
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.040]   Birder you you look ago. There's a purple build orange tailed thrush
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:29.800]   Or whatever, but I am always wondering you know, what the hell is that bird and it is it edible? That's the important thing
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.240]   Now there's a
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:38.920]   Five steps five simple questions. What size what were the main colors? What was the bird doing?
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:45.160]   Uh, why was it doing it? Why was it doing it? You also get bird photos birding is big
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.200]   I'm not a birder, but boy. I know birders and birding is huge
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.720]   Oh, there's bird you already know this app
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.080]   Oh, oh f&n done knows the site. Okay
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.920]   So
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.400]   You you also can hear what the bird sounds like you should just be able to point it at the bird
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.960]   Come on google f&n done is always giving somebody the bird
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:11.880]   But but I imagine they collect the data right so they can sort of 70 million data points
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:19.000]   70 million observations from the e-bird citizen science project wonder if they feel like their privacy is being violated
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.400]   Yeah, and that's my data
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:28.360]   Uh, so google was involved in this as was the national science foundation and the pennington's wild bird food
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:36.520]   But uh, I just thought that's kind of cool. Yeah, well big see sometimes big data is something as simple as what the hell does that? Yeah
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:39.320]   What the what am I looking at?
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.080]   It's actually fascinating because uh, you know they could do is for people
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:50.760]   Yeah, but they they choose not to there's a story that I ran across and almost covered on tnt this morning
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.600]   But it turns out that it's been in the news, but under the radar for a while
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:41:02.600]   But the the law enforcement and and a few universities are working on a tattoo database where an tattoo image recognition is that unique?
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.520]   Yeah, well right now they have 70 keywords
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:10.040]   So when the police have a suspect or whatever and they enter in identifying information
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.840]   They there's 70 words they can use to describe a tattoo. It's a girl. It's like, you know, there's that in the other house
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:21.000]   It's a secret logo. Right now. They're just using machine intelligence to identify tattoos
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   and
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.200]   It's a it's a whole it's becoming an important part of you know
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:32.440]   Of of that makes sense actually does doesn't it that's an identifying mark. Yeah, it's often unique. Yep
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.520]   The merlin bird big bird data app
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.800]   Big bird big bird data app
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.880]   The app replaces google
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.680]   No, and i'm sorry it's google backed
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.000]   Well identify it does say this article does say will identify a bird just from a photo
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.640]   So I guess that's that's just one of many
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:59.000]   Researchers have created a computer that vision
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.840]   Technology that will identify a species from a single photo
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:06.920]   Very cool
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.280]   Uh, mr. Mr. Jeff Jarvis. You got some before we get to the number
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:19.160]   Yeah, lancey mills inform me on twitter that the stuff crossed pizza with hot dogs came from
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:24.440]   Australia and the uk and canada first it is a product of the empire and on the rundown
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:30.600]   I have a 2012 guardian review of the pizza for even the progressive snooty guardian
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.800]   Actually kind of like that from that long ago, but see there's is there's is lateral a little bit different
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.160]   The we there is that lateral wiener it's going around. Yeah, it's weaved. It's weaved it through
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.880]   The hurt I think pizza hut has actually refined. I think it has
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:51.560]   I think it has but if you go below there's an australian commercial for it. I think you're gonna want to play. Ah
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:56.680]   Should I find that maybe on my right below right below on the next thing on the rundown
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.120]   Oh, it's on the rundown the rundown below. I do my do my work for you
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:09.080]   You sure do I believe that the the the version that you showed earlier in the show has actually originated in japan with the half hot dogs
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:14.040]   Oh, please. Let's see from the home of the hot dog to the home of stops trust
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:20.040]   Introducing paisa hud's new hot dog stuffed crust pizza. Oh god. That's disgusting. It's the
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:23.720]   I'll lay up paisa and then there's one below that from canada
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:31.640]   Notice the one from australia had much up met mustard and ketchup. Oh around the crust. Oh, it's just horrible
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.360]   Then here's the Canadian one
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:44.920]   You got pizza in my hot dog you got hot dogs in my pizza
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.960]   And this is pizza hot pizza and hot dog collide
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.320]   Oh, yes, we did the hot dog. It's just not
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.640]   Mustard on the pizza
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   Make it great. It's not okay. No, it's not gonna be enough. You shouldn't like that. No, let's knock it
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:12.120]   And then there's yeah, I I'm actually really so uh, it doesn't come to the United States
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.160]   For another week
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:22.520]   June 18th run now, but I think that next you're gonna get this in the studio. Aren't you? Oh, you're definitely
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:26.040]   Huh? Yeah, save the date. Yeah. Thank you, chris
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.160]   What day is it out there? That's your new june 18th
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:38.520]   Unfortunately the day after next week's twig. Oh, but maybe I'll come in and we'll have a very special unboxing
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.560]   Of the pizza had see but I think the pizza had one in the us is gonna be
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.720]   Better because the hot dogs are like little pigs in a blanket. They're sideways. They're little mini dogs
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:56.520]   It's meant for you know popping at a party. It's like a party popper. It's a party pop. Oh, it's just
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.800]   It's like break off a piece. It's a delicious looking
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.600]   Oh, yeah, you can just break off a piece. It's like i'm on i'm on the go right now. That's a good point
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.000]   In a hurry. I just need one of these to go
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.320]   Of course there's a event in uh
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.760]   In england and australia and apparently south korea
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.320]   Wow, man. It's bangers in pizza
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:23.320]   A little more labor intensive this way. I have to say yeah, I was opposed to just looping the hot dog
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.600]   Or you can call it the double sensation pizza
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.680]   No, that's something else pizza hot middle east released
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.880]   pizzas with a crust stuff with cheeseburgers
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:36.680]   and the other one with chicken nuggets
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.760]   why why
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.760]   Because it's twice as nice
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.520]   There's a pizza has confirmed
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:49.960]   That you will be able to get a large one topping pizza featuring 28 premium hot dog bites
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:55.640]   Baked into the crust served with a side of french's mustard for 11 dollars in 99
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:01.560]   Unlike by the way, this is the official pizza hut spokesperson
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:07.720]   Unlike international variations the hot dog bites pizza available in the united states while supplies last
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:11.960]   Will be surrounded by 28 bite-sized hot dogs baked into the crust
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:17.320]   Perfect for dipping into the free. Oh, they don't charge you for the mustard. Wow. That's what a deal
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.560]   The free side of french's mustard. Oh, they're using your data for that free mushroom
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.000]   Well, it replaces the mustard drizzle offered on previous versions
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.880]   Do you really want a mustard drizzle?
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.920]   Mm-hmm
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.600]   I wonder how the by the way
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.600]   By the way in my day
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.720]   A McDonald's hamburger came with ketchup and mustard. Yes. In fact, I used to be the guy who did it
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.040]   I squirted it. You can't get mustard on them anymore
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.880]   What they made I had we had a very special squirter that held mustard and ketchup
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:54.120]   So with one squirt you'd apply both. I know you were a girl guy at McDonald's
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:59.160]   I don't know if you knew that but that's what my high school job was and actually for the first couple of years of college
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.720]   Oh, which caused so you know I was
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.640]   I was the kitchen manager at ponderosa steakhouse nice
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.680]   And did I ever do this for you?
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:15.320]   So I I was taught to use the lettuce slicer by a very short guy who said keep your finger outside
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:23.320]   And some of a sudden you'll be okay. Yes, and it's sliced off. Oh my god. He's got a lettuce slice injury of the finger here
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.960]   See that?
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.040]   I made true chef salad
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.320]   Oh
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:35.800]   Who got the salad that your finger piece? The manager was trying to figure out whether he could save the salad and and was convinced that no
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:40.680]   He should throw it out. We're gonna pixelate that to shop by the way because he just flipped us all the bird
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:45.560]   Yeah, I didn't realize this but remember the original facebook like
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:51.640]   Uh button had a thumbs up. Yes turns out they had to remove that because culturally. Yes, that's not good
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:56.200]   That means up your means sit on this and rotate in the when it's out
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.960]   I think in the middle east the middle east places. Yeah, it is still the logo on the building in it headquarters
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.440]   There's so many hand gestures. You just don't want to use abroad, especially the okay gesture
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:11.400]   Which yeah, americans are going around Abu Dhabi going. Hey, that's great and the guy's going
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:18.920]   Yes, the source of all the tension it is actually in fact there it really isn't uh over religious
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:22.760]   No, no, it's over the gesture started with the american tourists
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:29.240]   Um isn't isn't that the the stole the gesture on the on the street sign at one hacker way?
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.800]   Maybe it is but it's not a mic button anymore
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.880]   map style
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.360]   Not like button. Oh, I just messed up. Do you have a number your numbers should be 28?
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.960]   All right, how many hot dogs are on that the number was I thought he was showed us the number two, right?
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:44.600]   Was that 11?
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.200]   Hey, hey
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:52.760]   Up your chef salad. Uh, no my number is one larry page is the highest rated boss
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.280]   Yes, I'm country right rightly so because golly he must be fun to work for
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:08.200]   Who was the guy before linkedin's jeff whiner? Yeah, wiener. Yeah speaking of hot dogs. I'm trying to give him a break
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.800]   I also pronounce it uranus
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:13.880]   Um, all right jeff wiener
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.640]   Was number one
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:21.160]   97 percent approval rating for larry page rose from 11th place last year. Has he been highly visible?
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:26.920]   He's been at all the events and answers the questions of course they do do they talk to him slowly he's to find this out
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.880]   Yeah, that's the employee survey us employees only
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.160]   Yeah, google also the best tech company to work for a glass door is the site that does that
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.840]   As opposed to glass ceiling. Yeah, that's right. That's a
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:44.040]   I guess that's the point number one larry page mark zuckerberg 95
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.920]   Tim cook only know it 94 percent. He's number 10 on the list
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:55.240]   jeff whiner down to 13 place down 12 places to number 12 93
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:03.160]   Only 15 tech CEOs on the on the top 100. Oh, these are the top tech guys. I guess these are the top tech guys
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.720]   There's a complete list with yeah
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.080]   So I just put up the facebook headquarters
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:14.760]   Sign on the chat and then run down. Okay, so that there it is still have a thumb
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:21.080]   Well, we're sorry. We just want to park. We want to apologize to our viewers in the middle east for showing that
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.240]   I
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:33.960]   Yeah, I've got to feel like the people who get that survey may not be completely forthright, right? Oh, I love larry
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.200]   Right. It's not like google's watching
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:44.040]   To come to them an email because if it did I don't know I just may this really may be more a measure of how how paranoid you are
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.040]   As an employee of a company. Yeah
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:50.680]   Do you have a nice little pick for us mr. Mike Elgin? I do it's a kind of picky
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:54.600]   tippy kind of the thing pickley tippy and droid users for a long time
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.920]   I've enjoyed a feature in google maps where you could
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:02.520]   Do a search find a place on google maps on your desktop and then you'd get a send to device
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:08.920]   Option that we just send that location right to your foot and you could do directions or whatever you want to do
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:14.680]   And it hasn't been available to ios users because apple has essentially blocked them from having that kind of integration
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:19.800]   Right, so google in its desire to be cross-platform to provide benefits to all of its users
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:25.160]   No matter what platform has found a really really clever workaround. They're sending it via
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:31.400]   Notification so so now send device exists on on the ios platform
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.880]   And i'm going to demonstrate it here put the camera on here
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.960]   So i've got a i've got twit here
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.960]   This is a silicon valley on this map right now
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.800]   So on your desktop and on the desktop i have twit and i'm going to click send to device
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:44.760]   And you're going to see that the map will suddenly move
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:49.160]   That's right. Okay, so it's asking me send to michaels phone. Okay, it's michael
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.920]   It's mike google
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:57.000]   Uh and what's going to happen is whoa you've jumped to betaluma now. He did that somehow through notifications
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.320]   Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, it's very interesting for apple blocks that i don't know
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:08.360]   I mean they can't really quite block notifications, but i don't know how they automatic sometimes you get the notification say do you want this?
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:12.440]   And you click it and he goes sometimes it just goes and i don't know how they do it
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:17.400]   But it's quite miraculous and it's a great feature and a major convenience for people you i give that
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:20.360]   Two thumbs up. Yes. Oh, sorry
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.400]   That was painful. Yeah
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.360]   Now i can i'll never look at this again the same way. Yeah
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:31.400]   Don't replace it with the okay symbol. That's that's bad too. That's where is that bad?
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:37.800]   Um, I don't recall where but it's basically what you're i think in idly that's bad. It's a hole what you're showing
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:42.920]   Yeah, it's a hole that's bad in idly. What about the v versus like uh, what about the british v thing?
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:46.440]   Oh, you do it one way i always forget i always forget which way is the wrong way
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:49.320]   Oh
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.560]   John we just grossed john out. Yeah, we've lost most of our world wide audience
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:53:00.920]   I want to on behalf of all of us here at twit apologize to our local audience. So the okay sign is very not good in brazil
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:03.240]   Brazil
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:08.680]   Brazil you know i feel like every time i travel it's a landmine out there. Yeah, it is you don't know what's gonna
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:12.440]   Keep your hands in your pockets. Although that may be offensive. Yeah, that could be bad too. Yeah
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:18.360]   Uh, there's apparently an entire wikipedia article on aok
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:24.280]   Uh, I guess here's how you'd say aok in a variety of nations
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:28.920]   It actually was uh invented by us air force lieutenant kernal john shorty powers
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:33.800]   You know, uh, he was public affairs officer for project mercury
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:42.760]   Or sure for all okay, right? It's a diving signal. I've used i've used that in diving scuba diving
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:47.400]   in some Mediterranean countries like turkey as well as brazil it is a vulgar expression
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.280]   either an insult
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.640]   or
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.640]   God it's terrible
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:54:00.440]   Wow when the sign in most continental european countries and the sign is placed over the nose
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:04.360]   With the nose protruding through the oh it means drunk
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.360]   huh

[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.360]   uh
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.000]   In the arab world it's used as a threatening gesture as in saying you will see you'll see
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.280]   And occultists believe it's the number 666
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.880]   because of the 666
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:27.800]   All I just think it's a okay. Hmm
