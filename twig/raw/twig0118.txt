[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.920]   It's because I'm wearing the shirt.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920]   Because you're wearing the shirt.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.960]   It's not for this week in Google.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.680]   I'm just pressing my orange button here
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.040]   and it starts the show.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200]   All right, the show is--
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.560]   they've given me a foot pedal.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960]   It's just to make me feel better.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.560]   I'm actually the Steve Jobs of this week in Google.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.440]   Leo Laport here, Jeff Jarvis on my right
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.560]   from the City University of New York.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.000]   And Buzzmachine.com are great friends.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.200]   I just love our panel here.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.920]   Gina Trapani is also here from, of course,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.800]   smarterwear.org and thinkupapp.com.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.520]   I look forward, as you do, I know, guys,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   every Wednesday just to get in together.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.120]   Talking, that's why I wore my Chipotle police outfit today.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.920]   It's our wrap session.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.440]   It's a--
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.160]   It is.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.880]   It's really fun.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.080]   We actually invited Dan Patterson from CBS to join us.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   He couldn't, CBS Radio News couldn't join us.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.840]   Then we asked Matt Cuts.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.560]   He's giving Larry Lessig a tour of Google.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.880]   So it's just the three of us.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.720]   It's just the cadre today.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.320]   But have you guys-- have you been reading?
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.200]   I've been sucked into that book for the past three days.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.120]   It's a long book.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.320]   Over 600 pages.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.760]   I'm about 400 pages in.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.000]   But apparently I didn't get to the juiciest stuff yet.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.200]   Well, the Android stuff.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.440]   That's why I brought it in today to talk about this.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   Yeah, some of these shoes you already seen,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.760]   but then there's stuff that wasn't quoted in the newspaper.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.400]   Jobs had tried to dissuade Google from developing Android.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.840]   He'd gone to Google's headquarters near Palo Alto in 2008
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.880]   and got into a shouting match.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.120]   This is Walter Isaacson writing,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   "With Paige, Brynn, in the head of the Android development team,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   Andy Rubin.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.880]   Because Schmidt, Eric Schmidt, the CEO,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.600]   was on the board of Apple.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.120]   He recused himself from discussions involving iPhone.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.440]   It says, "jobs felt personally betrayed by Eric Schmidt
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.360]   because he'd been on the Apple board during the development
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.560]   of the iPhone and iPad.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.960]   And he felt that perhaps Android's touchscreen interface
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   was adopting more and more of the features--
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.080]   multi-touch swiping, a grid of app icons-- that Apple, he says,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.240]   had created.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   I said-- this is quoting Steve Jobs now.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.720]   Remember, he had 40 interviews with Steve Jobs.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960]   And these are all coming from those tapes.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.760]   Quote, "I said if we had good relations,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.600]   guarantee Google access to the iPhone,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.800]   guarantee it one or two icons on the home screen."
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.040]   Jobs are called.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   But he also threatened that if Google continued to develop--
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.240]   this is what Jobs does throughout this book--
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.280]   Carrot and Stick.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   He says, "I'll give you something or I'm going to threaten you."
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   But he also threatened if Google
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.960]   continued to develop Android and used any iPhone features
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.480]   such as multi-touch he would sue.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.960]   Apple has a patent on multi-touch,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.120]   which was thrown out later.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.080]   At first, Google avoided copying certain features.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.120]   But in January 2010, HTC introduced an Android phone
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.640]   that boasted multi-touch.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.040]   Remember that?
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.320]   In the first iteration of the G1, no multi-touch.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.080]   Right.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.480]   Wasn't that weird?
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.440]   That's why.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.320]   Now we know why.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.000]   I mean, that's what's great about this.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.400]   We've got to take a look at the apps to the stuff that we knew
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   was happening.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.840]   We didn't know why it was happening.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.920]   And many other aspects of the iPhone's look and feel.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.440]   This was the context for Jobs' pronouncement
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.360]   that Google's "Don't Be Evil" slogan was BS.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.560]   Remember, he said that to an all-hands meeting in Apple.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.920]   So Apple sues HTC.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.400]   And by extension, Android, a lynching infringement
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.440]   of 20 of its patents.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.280]   Among them were patents covering various multi-touch gestures
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.000]   swiped to open, double-tapped to zoom, pinch, and expand.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And that's what it says.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It's a term in how a device was being held.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.520]   As he sat in his house in Palo Alto, the week the lawsuit
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   was filed, he became angrier than I had ever seen them.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.200]   The quote, "Our lawsuit is saying, Google, you effing ripped off
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   the iPhone.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   Wholesale ripped us off.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Grand theft.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.000]   I will spend my last dying breath if I need to.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.640]   I am going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.800]   I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.760]   They are scared to death because they know they are guilty.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.440]   Outside of search, Google's products Android, Google Docs are--
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.680]   and he uses another strong word I'll just say, crap.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.800]   A few days after this rant, Jobs got a call from Schmidt
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.920]   who had resigned from the Apple board the previous summer.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.840]   He suggested they get together for coffee.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.440]   And they made it a cafe in a Palo Alto shopping center.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.960]   Again, we--
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.880]   Is that the meeting?
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.640]   That was the meeting.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.440]   We saw these pictures.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.480]   It was an important meeting.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.920]   We speculated, what could they be talking about?
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.360]   Yes.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.080]   We felt funny.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   They felt they were gaming the press.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.760]   Oh, baby.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.600]   They were doing it in a public place to be safe from--
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.800]   So they wouldn't beat each other up?
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   I don't know.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.320]   Here's the quote from Jobs.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.200]   We spent half the time talking about personal matters.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.240]   Then-- oh, actually, this is Eric Schmidt.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.000]   Because remember, Isaac said, I have to say,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.200]   this book is very even handed.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.520]   It is not a geography.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.160]   He really is warts and all.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.880]   And he talked to 100 other people besides Jobs,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.520]   including Eric Schmidt.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.160]   He says-- Schmidt says, we spent half the time
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.160]   talking about personal matters.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.920]   And half the time, on his perception,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.840]   that Google had stolen Apple's user interface designs.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.160]   When it came to the latter subject,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   Jobs did most of the talking.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.600]   Google had ripped him off, he said, in colorful language.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.320]   We got you red-handed, he told Schmidt.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.720]   I'm not interested in settling.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.320]   I don't want your money.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.400]   If you offer me $5 billion, I won't want it.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.800]   I've got plenty of money.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.360]   I want you to stop using our ideas in Android.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.720]   That's all I want.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.880]   It's so ironic, given the beginning of the book,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.720]   where you get the whole story about how the Apple team
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.480]   have visited Xerox Park and seen the GUI interface
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.880]   that they were developing there and kind of went straight back
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.760]   to Apple and built that their operating system to work that way.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.440]   And when you think about it, the touchscreen interface
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.160]   is very much an extension of the point and click.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.040]   GUI interface, you just use your fingers.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.400]   Well, and Apple does not own multi-touch.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.560]   We saw a demo.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.240]   Remember that Ted demo from Carnegie Mellon?
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.720]   Years before this.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.560]   Apple doesn't own multi-touch.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.000]   Right.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   So I just find this so amusing.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.880]   I mean, the shouting matches in the tears,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.440]   there's many of them throughout the book.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   And it makes for a great read, because he was just such an intense
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.000]   character.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.520]   But it just seems so crazy that he was that.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.040]   And on one hand, he would just say, everything else is crap.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.960]   Apple makes beautiful products and everything else is crap.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.080]   But on the other, he's so threatened by Google
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.280]   doing Android that he kind of freaks out
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.960]   and has this total meltdown about it.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   He very famously is quoted in this book as well.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.400]   Told the Macintosh team he quoted Picasso.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.560]   He said, good artist copy, great artist steal.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.680]   Great artist steal, exactly.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.320]   He said that.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.840]   But you know what?
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.640]   This is Steve Jobs.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.760]   Consistency is not his middle name.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.840]   He made no attempt to be consistent.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.040]   This is part of the reality distortion field.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.680]   Whatever he felt like, that's what he said.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.200]   This is how it is.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.400]   And you know, you can't even be surprised by it, really.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.720]   I mean, it's just Steve.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.840]   This is what made him what he was.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.720]   Schmidt continues.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.880]   Steve has a particular way he wants to run Apple.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.120]   And it's the same as it was 20 years ago,
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.160]   which is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of closed systems.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.600]   Gates said the same thing about him early on.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.520]   They don't want people to be on their platform
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.200]   without permission.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.240]   In fact, there's an anecdote at the beginning, Gina.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.900]   You've read this already, where Wozniak wants in the Apple
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.760]   2 to have slots, eight slots.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.160]   Yes.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.960]   And Jobs says no.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.360]   That's a great story.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   Can't have slots.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.600]   People will modify it.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.160]   And Woz says, well, but that's what we do.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.960]   That's what hackers do.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.280]   We want to modify it.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.200]   Jobs says, there will be two slots.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.640]   One for video, one for keyboard or something.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.120]   It was like a printer and something else.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   And they monitor.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.800]   And that's it.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   And they had to fight.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.680]   Woz won this one.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.240]   But it says in the book, Woz knew.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.120]   This was the last time he--
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.840]   The last time that he went.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.040]   Yeah, Woz is such a great character through the book.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.360]   He's honest, and he's straightforward,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.720]   and he's an engineer, and he has such a deep conscience.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.120]   And he forgives Jobs for being a jerk
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.160]   so in so many different ways.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.840]   Because he admires his leadership.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.440]   And Woz recognizes that Jobs has skills
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.400]   that he doesn't have, which is interesting.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.440]   Because Jobs isn't so great at giving credit.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.160]   I mean, throughout the book, every great idea
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.840]   he talks about is if it were his own.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.720]   Well, even Johnny, I have the great designer
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.600]   complains about that.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.000]   And he's a very copper-bury of Jobs,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.840]   but he says, but that kind of would rankle me
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   because he'd take credit for everything.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   So what do you each think of him as a person?
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   No, let me finish this, and then we'll get it.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.080]   And then we'll talk about that.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.520]   So Schmidt says, they don't want people
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.040]   to be on their platform without permission.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.720]   The benefits of a closed platform is control.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.760]   But Google has a specific belief
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.560]   that open is the better approach because it
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.640]   leaves to more options and competition than consumer choice.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.240]   Bill Gates.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.680]   Responding to this battle against Google
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.160]   as Jobs had battled Microsoft.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160]   Remember, Jobs sued Microsoft for the trash can.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.120]   Bill Gates says, there's some benefits
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.240]   to being more closed in terms of how much you control
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   the experience.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   And certainly at times, he's had the benefit of that.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   But refusing to license the Apple OS
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   gave competitors like Android the chance to gain greater volume.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   This is Jobs.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   Google says, we exert more control than they do.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   That we are closed and they are open.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.240]   This is Jobs talking to Isaacson when Isaacson told him what--
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   Schmidt just read that quote that I just gave you.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   We'll look at the results.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.240]   Android is a mess.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   It has different screen sizes and versions,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   over 100 permutations.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   Even if Google's approach might eventually win
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.240]   in the marketplace, Jobs found it repellent.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.240]   Quote, I like being responsible for the whole user experience.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   We do it not to make money.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   We do it because we want to make great products like crap
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   like Android.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.240]   Wow.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   Wow.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   This is one of those tell-all biographies.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   It's kind of like every page is like, oh, that's what was going on.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   Yeah, it was really interesting for me to read.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   I mean, that emphasis on having the--
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   you call it the whole widget experience,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   owning everything, the hardware, the software, the device,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.240]   and everything.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.240]   It always annoyed me.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   I mean, Jobs sort of infuriated me in life.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   But now in death, it's interesting hearing about how that came about.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   The book book makes the point that iTunes or that digital music
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   couldn't have changed the way that it did if Apple hadn't had
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   control of the entire experience from the Mac to iTunes to the iPod.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   And so you really kind of see the advantage there.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   I mean, I remember I had a PC when I got my first iPod
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.240]   and I was using the crappy music match software before iTunes
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   imported to Windows.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   It was horrible, horrible, horrible.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   And it was definitely-- the iPod was sort of my Mac gateway.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   I was like, oh, I would maybe like to get to Mac.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   And this iTunes is interesting.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   Richard Stalman in a very controversial statement right at the day
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.240]   that Jobs died says, iPhone made jail cool.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   Well, he just doesn't have lots of locks and social skills.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   He just-- no social risks.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   But if Jobs did believe that copying was the art and understood
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   that, then it strikes me that maybe he wasn't mad about Android copying him.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   It was that he was mad that Android really would one up him.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   But he made this space.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   He made this thing.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   His ego was invested in this.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   And Android's model is a better model for growth.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   Not saying the product was better, but for growth and for taking over much of the market,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   he was going to make this thing happen and then lose a chunk of it right away.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   I mean, I wonder if you worried about what happened with Windows happening again, right?
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   Right.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   So like that the Mac is sort of stagnated and Windows ran and all these different computers.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   Exactly.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   And it took over while Apple was sleeping.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   And this is happening during a time.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   Steve knew he didn't have much time left.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   And I wonder about that if that's the concern.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   It was for all of his, so now to answer your question, Jeff.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   For all of his introspection and his Buddhist beliefs and, you know, his, in fact, one of
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   his early girlfriends said Steve was both enlightened in the biggest jerk ever, you know.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.240]   Or something like that.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   I'm paraphrasing.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   But I don't think he was actually very introspective.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   I think he maybe he knew that he was a character, but he didn't really look at these inconsistencies at all.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   He didn't bother him.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   He didn't even examine them.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240]   It was just, hey, this is what I want.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   This is how I feel.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   I'm going to do it.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   He believed in intuition, not rationality.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.240]   He says, says that in the book many times.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.240]   And this is just an example of that where he doesn't have to be consistent.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   I can steal from them, but they better not steal from me.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.240]   You know, he doesn't see it as being a problem.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   And it's perhaps part of why he was great.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   They asked, the Guardian asked Hugo Barra.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:10.240]   Hugo hadn't read the book, so they quoted this, this statement that Jobs said, "Androde was stolen.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   I'm going to kill it."
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   Barra said, "He said that."
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   And then the Guardian said, "Well, isn't IOS5?
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   I mean, isn't Android ice cream sandwich stealing from IOS5?"
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   Mr. Barra said, "I'm not going to get into this.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.240]   He didn't want to go there."
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   So there's been no direct Google response to this.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   I think it's just what we always knew.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   I mean, it just in some ways this kind of confirms everything we've said all along.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   But what he really, and there's another sentence in here, I'm not going to try to find it,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   in which he talks about how horrible companies like IBM are, these companies that want to
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   chain you up, you know, he believed himself to be the counterculture hero, the rebel,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   right?
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   The square peg in the round hole.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   And of course he's making the most closed system of all my round hole.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:09.240]   And he put Google in there with the evil companies with, he said, "Microsoft IBM and Google."
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   I'll see if I can find the...
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   Well, but also the story on the rundown is Larry Page going to jobs for advice when he got the CEO role
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   and friendly enough to give it to him.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   And I loved in that that what jobs basically warned against by having too much stuff going on,
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   you're going to turn it into Microsoft.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   Right.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   Well, that's good advice.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   It is.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   It was very good advice.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.040]   And I think it's why we're seeing, you know, that he really did have a role jobs did and
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.240]   even Google's reorganization.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.240]   He was beloved and respected and Silicon Valley.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   There's no question about that.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   He was.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:52.040]   There's a similar story, not in the book, but the Nike new CEO of Nike had a chance to talk
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.120]   to jobs and said, "Do you have any advice for me?"
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.880]   And jobs said something like, "You know, Nike makes a lot of beautiful products and it makes
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.200]   a lot of crap.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   Not making the crap."
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.800]   I wish that was, I wish it were that easy.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.040]   And it sounds like that was sort of his advice to, to, to page as well.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   Just do the good stuff.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   Here's the quote.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:17.360]   "Once IBM gains control of a market sector, they almost always stop innovation.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.960]   Even 30 years later reflecting back on the competition, jobs cast it as a holy crusade.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.160]   IBM was essentially Microsoft at its worst.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.480]   They were not a force for innovation.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.000]   They were forced for evil.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.200]   They were like AT&T or Microsoft or Google.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   A force for evil.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.240]   Yeah, there's no gray, right?
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.920]   Like you're either a hero or a bozo.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.120]   There's just very like the realistic view of the world, right?
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.880]   Like you're either awesome or you're horrible.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   You were companies.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.440]   Did he, were there any companies he thought were awesome?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.920]   One of his heroes was Edwin Land of Polar Rock.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.400]   But land like jobs is forced out of his company.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   And Hewlett Packard early on.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.600]   Yeah, he built Hewlett a lot.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.800]   In fact, there's a story of him calling Bill Hewlett at home saying, can I get some chips?
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.000]   And getting a job, doing a job on the line and pissing off the employees there because
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.600]   he was this kid with Hutspa.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   Right.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.800]   A lot of Hutspa and body odor apparently.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   Yes.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.760]   He believed because he was on a fruitarian diet.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.840]   He didn't eat only a fruit.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   He believed that he needed bays only once a week and that he, you know, he would smell
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.960]   like an apple.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.880]   And apparently nobody else felt that way.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.960]   Like when he worked at Atari, they made him work the overnight because nobody could stand
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   next to him.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   You really had to, you know, when they talked about his charisma, you really had to believe
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.400]   that the charisma was really strong or else you, you know, no one will put up with them.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   Otherwise.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   Yeah, there was something wasn't there.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.480]   You're right.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.360]   And I think that that's, I think that's true.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   He mesmerized.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.760]   And I don't, I guess I didn't mean to get in a Steve Jobs conversation.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.720]   I just wanted to quote this stuff from Google here.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.120]   But I think it is interesting.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.040]   And you know, one of my, one of my sources of sadness is that I won't get to ever see
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.120]   a Steve Jobs product intro ever again.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.640]   Because they, from day one, they were the best.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.600]   Can you name a nice genius?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   Besides Leo?
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.480]   No, I'm not a genius.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.280]   If I were a bit more of a dick, I'd be a genius.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.040]   I can't bring myself to that, that, that nth degree of.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.120]   Do you think it's a requirement, Jeff?
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.080]   Well, that's what I don't, you know, no.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.600]   In theory, I don't.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   Einstein, there's a nice genius.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.120]   He was a very nice little guy.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Although his personal life was a wreck.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.040]   Was, was a genius, but nice, but, but I don't think you mean genius.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.560]   I think you mean, um, great man.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.280]   Well, great success, right?
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.240]   You know, it's the boggner problem.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.040]   I mean, there are nice people who are geniuses, but they don't necessarily, they don't, they
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.240]   necessarily go down in history.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.640]   It's so, so great men are women.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.080]   That's the thing I've been thinking about this book, reading this book, it's been interesting.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.880]   It's like, I realize that I just value kindness or people too much and objects not enough.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   Right.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   And I realize it's not kind, I got to, I don't value just kindness.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.480]   I don't think people should be polite just for the sake of being polite.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.640]   I think I just valued diplomacy and it just seemed like jobs use people.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   He did.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.400]   Um, you know, to, to, to get, to get what he wanted.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.920]   He was a salesman.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   He was a brilliant salesman.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.960]   And that just sort of left a little bit of a, it's like, you know, I don't know, I'd
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.880]   rather be John Lasseter or be Steve Wozniak need, you know, both these guys are geniuses,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880]   right?
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.200]   Creative geniuses and engineering for Woz and art for Lasseter, but neither one of them
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.160]   had the, um, yeah, I mean, both of them have done amazing things, right?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.120]   But it was because Steve Jobs was there to take their work and say, push it forward.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.760]   Lasseter needed jobs, Woz needed jobs, both acknowledge that.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.760]   Exactly.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.840]   You know, one point of the book, they talk about how the tone at Pixar that jobs would,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.400]   would go to Pixar to kind of relax because the, at Apple, things were always tense and
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.600]   people were scrambling around and it was just a lot of stress and, and, and that was sort
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.800]   of because of jobs and that Lasseter is just kind of like this joyful art.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   I know, John.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   I know, John.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   He is.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   He's jolly.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   He's sweet.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   He's funny.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.880]   He has a, he has the world's best train set, which is actually a full size train in this,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.480]   it is, it is, he's got, he built a water park and a train in his, in his new house.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.440]   Oh, that doesn't surprise me.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.080]   It surprised me that pick Pixar things were, you know, they make great products.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.200]   Pixar makes amazing movies, but the tone wasn't the stress and the kind of meanness
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.080]   and cutting that was going on at Apple.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.800]   And you know, the leader sets the tone for what happens at a company.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.760]   Well, you'll get to hire Lasseter for that.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   More than that.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.840]   You'll get to the, um, Toy Story story, which is very interesting because they did it with
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:53.320]   Disney and Jeffrey Katzenberg apparently was exactly like jobs, um, micro managing,
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.320]   a new evil, creepy and demanding, you know, excellence.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.040]   So apparently Lasseter kept bringing the Toy Story story to Katzenberg who said, give
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   it more edge.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.600]   Woody's too nice.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.160]   And they made the first half of the movie and the toys were like, you hated them.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.600]   Woody would push people off the bed.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.560]   They ruined Toy Story, right?
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.600]   He told, he told the slinky, he said, the slinky said, you're just a spring wiener.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   Get out of here.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   And he pushed him off.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:28.120]   And so, and what's interesting is jobs did not in any way intervene in Toy Story.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.680]   He just sat back, let Katzenberg screw it up.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.720]   And finally, Katzenberg backed off and they made the real Toy Story, not the one that they
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   were going to make.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   Thank God.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.120]   Because he saw Lasseter's genius and gave him the reins to make those, those, you know,
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.240]   he trusted him, right, to get out of his way.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.720]   And that was a good, that was, you know, that was smart.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.520]   Edison was a dick.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   Yes.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   Famous famously.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   He killed an elephant.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.400]   Wait, I thought that was the Go Daddy guy.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.720]   The Go Daddy guy is also a dick.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   So there we go.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   I rest my case.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.120]   And shot an elephant.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   And shot an elephant.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.320]   You know, the picture would find it was nice.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.920]   He was good on the bongos.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.240]   That's true.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.720]   After watching the 60 minutes last week, it really struck me that I wish they would release
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   the job's tapes.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   I do too.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   And maybe they will.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   There's some hope.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.760]   The fact it was clear that Isaacson was able to get those played.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   Yes.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.920]   It was really great to hear those.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.200]   Really was because it really adds in a lot.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.360]   There's that there's that strength to his voice.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.120]   Even when he's sick, right?
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.280]   There's this determination that you hear in him, this sense that I'm right and I know
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   it.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   And here's what I'm saying.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:42.040]   And honesty, you know, bluntness too in his in his distortion field within that that just
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.320]   was really something to hear.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.600]   And you can hear emphasis that you can't necessarily hear in the book.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.760]   Like I watched that 60 minutes and then I read the book and certain quotes I had, you
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.480]   know, I heard differently because I'd watched 60 minutes.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.240]   So I hope they release those tapes.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.800]   That's really a good point.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.560]   Jeff, do what you can.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.960]   I'll tweet it right now.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   You haven't in it.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   I'm interested.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   Don't you ever.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   Oh, well.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   I'm nothing.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   I'm nothing.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.600]   Come on.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.080]   You got people there, don't you?
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.400]   That is true, though.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.880]   They didn't get you a 60 minutes interview, did they?
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.360]   Oh, they sure as well.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.280]   By the way, public, but everybody's frozen.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   Public parts and so well.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   Just do this.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   I'm doing commercial.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.760]   You are to everybody's frozen except me.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.320]   I'm still animated and we're going to take a break as we get everybody back on the line
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.800]   and talk a little bit about the folks that go to meeting the world's finest meeting software.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.040]   And now, by the way, it works.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   First of all, you set up a meeting on your Mac or your PC, but people can attend your
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   meeting, not just on the iPad, but now on any Android phone or tablet.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   Is that awesome?
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.760]   And the iPhone 2.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.160]   So you can be anywhere and attend a go to meeting meeting.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:55.560]   This is -- go to meeting is online meeting software that is just absolutely fantastic.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.080]   I just was on a go to meeting yesterday.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   And you should see the camera quality that they get with this.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.240]   They have the new HD faces built in.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:09.080]   So you're screen sharing, which has always been, but you also have now the camera on there.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.480]   And we're talking with Brian.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   I don't remember where he was.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.080]   You're seeing brilliant video.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.080]   He sees us.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.120]   It is just the right way to communicate.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.200]   And you can -- and Crystal Clear High Def.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.040]   This is the new HD faces featured on Go To Meeting.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.800]   So hold a meeting on a Mac or a PC.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.560]   Attend the meeting on a Mac PC, Android, iPhone or iPad.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.720]   It is awesome.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.000]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.280]   Don't have another meeting without Go To Meeting in your back pocket.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.240]   I'm telling you this changes your life.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.920]   Built in, by the way, of teleconferencing, voice over IP, all that stuff.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.000]   Go visit gotomeeting.com and when you click the tr -- here, and I'll show you, you click
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.840]   the orange try it free button.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   Close that box.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.160]   That's under there.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.480]   And somewhere.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.480]   I'm using this new Chrome.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.240]   We got to talk about Chrome 15.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.480]   Anyway, go to meeting.com.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.840]   With the try it free button, use the offer code twig.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   I love it.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   We love it.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.340]   We use it religiously.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.160]   We eat our own dog food, as they say.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.320]   Although I wouldn't call Go To Meeting.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   It is caviar.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   It is steak.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   It is fide.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   So Chrome 15.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.760]   How do we -- I ask -- do you know what's going on?
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.600]   It's like they update this thing every five minutes.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   They do.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.840]   I was thinking about -- you know, I use a dev version.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.560]   I don't know if it's the full dev version.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   It's kind of the middle one.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.840]   So I get these things sooner than the stable version release.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.800]   So I don't really talk about them because not everybody has them.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.280]   But then it comes out in the stable release and you don't realize because you've had
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   it forever.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.040]   Usually it just happens without you doing anything.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.120]   I've just opened my about Chrome box.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.360]   You can see here.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.200]   And I'm at 15.0.874102.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.600]   But it does say a new version available.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.080]   So you can't force the update when you do about Chrome.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.600]   I'm going to do that right now.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.000]   What's new in 15?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Have you noticed?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   I think the main thing is that the new tab page is new.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.360]   If you -- it actually can -- you can switch between apps and most visited sites.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.000]   And in the app section, it's actually kind of iOS-like.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.400]   You can click on an app -- yeah.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   I don't want you to say that.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.000]   You can click and hold on an app and you can drag it to the bottom right and remove it
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   from Chrome.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.760]   You can rearrange your apps.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.920]   Apparently, the web store has gotten some.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.000]   So let me do this here.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.680]   So what do I do?
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   I click and hold.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.360]   It's not going to jiggle, is it?
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.200]   No, it's not going to jiggle.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.760]   That's in work for you?
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.680]   Well, I'm not -- maybe at the latest Chrome 15.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.040]   I downloaded right before the show.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   And there's already a new version.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.800]   Yeah, that's what's going on with me, too.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.280]   There's a new version out here.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.720]   So here's the web store.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   So what's different?
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   I didn't -- I don't --
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   Yeah, it's a store.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   It's a store.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   It's a store that sells to the shelf.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.320]   I think we can go overboard with the -- it's new stuff.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   Right.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.320]   Yeah, I mean, it's infinite scrollings.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.960]   You don't have to page.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.160]   And it's got -- you know, the organization emphasizes, you know, these kind of banners,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.480]   these app banners to kind of advertise them a little better.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   So it's just a little bit of a redesign.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.440]   It matches the app store on the phone now more.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   Right?
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.160]   Because we have these -- yeah, I mean, Android.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.080]   Because we have these on the phone, the Android phone, the marketplace on the phone.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.200]   Yeah, it does look more similar to the Android market.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   I like the phone.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.080]   The only Android phones would update the way Chrome updates.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   If only.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   That's a good side.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.600]   You know, would that be nice?
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   That's where it should be.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   Holy cow.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   Dream on.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.800]   My Nexus One is now obsolete.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.760]   And it's not even two years old yet.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   So it's still in contract.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.760]   Is that true?
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.880]   Nexus -- they're not going to go ice cream sandwich on Nexus One.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.320]   So that stinks really badly.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.160]   Of course, what's wrong here is the two-year contract.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.800]   But when they sell you a two-year contract for a phone, it should be -- and the promise
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.720]   that's updateable and updated, it should be updated that whole damned time.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.600]   18 months is not enough.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.280]   So we actually have to throw a Kinzayanos party for Chrome.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   Nobody got that.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280]   Okay.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   Kinz -- Kinzayano.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   Thank you.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   15.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.240]   The party that they throw for 15 years.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   It's 15 now.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   All right.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   I shouldn't have gone there.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   Let me see now.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   I've got the update.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.040]   Let me hold it and I can -- it does get bigger.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.500]   You can drag and drop and re-
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   Look.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   Oh, look.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   Just like the iPhone.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.720]   And then if you drag and drop it to the bottom right, you can remove it.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.320]   That's how you want it to stall.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.960]   I mean, it's a lot like iOS.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.200]   So how often do you use Chrome apps?
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   Like how often do you use that?
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   Rarely.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.960]   You see, I have a bunch of stall, but the whole point of installing them was to show
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   them off on the show.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   I hardly ever use it.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   I get into some habits.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.960]   If I don't want -- when I want movie listings, my fixture is there.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.400]   I'm going to use that.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.640]   And that's the only one I'm really in the habit of using.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   If I got it in the habit of using others, I would use it.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   I'm like, I have Hulu there.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.320]   I go to the web for using Hulu.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.000]   I don't go there.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.320]   I don't know why.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.880]   There needs to be some better linkage.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   What do you hear?
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   It was a program.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:31.200]   If I just put it in my tons in the address bar, because I haven't installed, it will
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:37.640]   give me the app store in my times rather than in my times.com.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.280]   Or search in my times, either of those.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.720]   It will say, clearly, this is cool.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.360]   You just drag it up there and you get a little icon.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   I start typing in my times.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.040]   It then says you want the app.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.840]   You got it.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Got it.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   Huh.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.480]   Not doing that for me, for some reason.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   Oh, slash Chrome.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.640]   Yeah, it did.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   So that's the app.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   If you go to slash Chrome, it's the app.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.680]   You actually don't want the New York Times.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.720]   My issue is I don't see the really -- I mean, an app is just a fancy web page.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   Right?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   Right.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   So you go to the address bar for a web page.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.080]   I'm unclear on the distinction, to be honest.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.360]   I'm not going to steal my numbers for later, but later on, it goes about --
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   They do.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.840]   -- use of news apps, too.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.680]   But I think that I've seen a lot of research that just says people go to the web.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   And --
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.040]   And as web pages become more HTML5 --
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   Exactly.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.640]   In fact, Amazon's just announced they're going to use HTML5 for Kindle format books.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.800]   Oh, they are?
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   So this is good news.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   I mean, this is really --
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.600]   Well, really, we are really moving to a standard.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.440]   That means that we could do things like put videos in books.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   Oh.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.320]   Well, if the hardware supports it, you know, I mean, it's a little challenge.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.320]   Right.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.320]   That's true.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   But that's pretty cool.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.840]   Megan Garber at the Neiman Lab, who's brilliant and who also -- I'm not going to get into a
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.560]   certain bit more I have going on right now attacking me for my book.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.560]   But out of his --
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.360]   Oh, now I'm searching.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360]   -- attacks.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   Don't even go there.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.800]   It's just a pain in the butt.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   But she wrote a great post about how books aren't a very good way.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   There's Megan's post.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.360]   Oh, the Jarvis Mora's off SPAT.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   Yeah, I'll leave it.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.000]   It sounds like something out of the Cold War.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.760]   The Jarvis Mora's off SPAT.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.560]   Yeah, there's nukes aimed at my house.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.360]   How can you find -- it's just a -- it's a --
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.320]   Oh, he's right.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.600]   He wants to have a World War again.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.160]   He said he wants a World War against me.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   That's another matter of --
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.920]   It's me and Shurkey and all these guys.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.520]   We dare to be optimists.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:42.560]   Anyway, Megan finds chicken salad in this chicken poop and writes a really great post
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.880]   about how books aren't viral and can a book be viral.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.440]   She gives me more credit than I deserve for having talked about the ideas of the book
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.600]   before the book.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.480]   And I said that I haven't done nearly enough of that.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.040]   We have to rethink what it is.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.480]   So I wrote a long post coming back on the kind of the business that I want to see started
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:05.520]   that would enable people to use Kickstarter-like functions, to have events, to support themselves
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.760]   while they do that.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.480]   And the book might be a byproduct.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.720]   The process is the product.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.080]   The book has -- maybe there's reasons to do it, but it's not really there.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.160]   But finally, to the point, it takes me a while.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   I know.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.400]   If you did get there, there at some point you have a book, and if print really does start
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.200]   to truly go away, then what's a book look like, right?
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.080]   The book should include videos from these events.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.760]   It should include graphics and slideshows and whatever the hell you want.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:38.560]   So if the Kindle Fire, finally, presents books as HTML5, that to me is a key moment for
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.280]   changing our notion of the book.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   I agree.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.760]   I'm reading the Steve Jobs book on my iPad in the Kindle app, and there's a bunch of
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.320]   parts where they're talking about the different iPod campaigns and different commercials.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.560]   And I found myself flipping to YouTube and looking up the commercials, you know, watching
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   the videos while I was.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.800]   And then what you just said earlier about the source interviews, you know, I would love
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.480]   to have been able to tap play and listen to Steve say the words, you know, the quoted.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.600]   And I was thinking like, "I wish that he had embedded these YouTube videos that, you know,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.800]   the 1984 commercial and the different iPod, the YouTube iPod that they did and the YouTube
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   commercial."
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.880]   I would love to have seen that.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.280]   So yeah, I mean, that would be an, and you can do a lot of that manually, you know, reading
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.120]   on an iPad or a Kindle.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.240]   That starts to rethink exactly.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.080]   I got a point out though that you need a fire.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.120]   You couldn't do that on an E-ink Kindle.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   This is not a first-player.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   I agree.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.240]   Or I agree, but they're like, like, in Nexus 1, they'll be obsolete.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   Yep.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.080]   And, and, and, but where, where are we headed here?
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.800]   I, you know, get your drinking glasses ready, folks.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.880]   I'm about to say Gutenberg.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.880]   Hummerma's.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.640]   No, I'm staying away from him this week.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.840]   So, you know, as I think I've said on the show before, Elizabeth Eisenstein Gutenberg
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.600]   scholar says the book did not begin to take on its full form until 50 years after its
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   invention.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   I've been saying that for years.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.280]   And I wrote a piece just looking about this for Google's think quarterly.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.160]   I end up writing a piece for them about about speed.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.800]   And in order to curtly that we all think that the change we're undergoing is so fast,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   what if it's slow?
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.040]   What if we're actually just barely at the beginning?
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   That's heresy.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   Oh, you mean it's slow?
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040]   You don't mean it's slow.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   You mean it's going to get faster?
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.440]   Well, yeah, it's we're just, we barely seen it.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:24.960]   So if you start to see then the book, I think, it's my specialty to read too much into things,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.640]   you know, but, but if you start to see HTML5 backed by Amazon for books, then you start
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.440]   to see the beginning of changing the form.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.480]   I think it's, I think it's wildly important.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.880]   Well, I do think that that was part of the intent of the fire.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.600]   It's certainly the intent of the iPad is to, is to remember one of the things Steve Jobs
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.400]   said that one of the last goals he had was to read, define textbooks.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.840]   And I have to think it had to do very much with that, right?
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   Right.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   Right.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.560]   Well, my, my daughter has a, has an eye convergence thing.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.000]   And so she's in training for it.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.640]   That's fine, but we've been getting, you know, electronic books for her and audio books for
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   her and all these things.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.840]   And they aren't textbooks.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   Don't work in PDF.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.040]   They don't work online because you've got to go all around the page.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.480]   We've got to move stuff around and there's no, you know, it's, it's the, they need to
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.640]   be utterly, completely, absolutely rethought.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.200]   Well, there are two, it's interesting.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.760]   There are two big companies doing, electronic textbooks.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.240]   And one is trying to make it as true to the textbook as possible down to the pagination.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.880]   The theory being, well, in the class, the professor's escape go to page 269 and needs
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.040]   to be on your tablet, 269.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.560]   And the other one, I can't remember, there's one KNO is one of them.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.080]   And I can't remember what the other one is, is saying, no, let's reinvent textbooks, let's
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.280]   put multimedia, let's put audio, let's make it all new and different, exciting.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:50.800]   Um, anyway, so let me, the story is not that they will, they're going to have a format,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.960]   Kindle Fire 8, which allows publishers to create books and genres that require rich formatting,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:07.320]   such as children's picture books, comic books, graphic novels, using HTML5 markup, multi,
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.920]   they say multimedia.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   That's interesting.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.840]   Yes, it's a little controversial, right?
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.440]   Because ePub is actually based on on HTML.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.880]   This is a non, this is a non standard.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.960]   This is an Amazon by the way, Gina, what is this?
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   See that?
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.680]   Yeah, I have seen that.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   What the hell is that?
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.160]   Is this a Mac or a Chrome?
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   I don't know.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   I've never seen this before.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.680]   I have seen that.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   And I'm not sure what it is.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   What are you doing?
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.200]   You're like, you're sliding back and forth with my fingers.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   I think this is a new Chrome back button.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   Is this Apple?
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.360]   Oh, is that the, is that the new back button?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.440]   Oh, this is the new swiping back button.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   I'm not getting that.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.360]   I said, what is this in the chat room said, Leo, that's an arrow pointed to your left.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   Oh, thank you.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.040]   It is, if you're listening, it's hard to describe.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.480]   It's a little lion thing that's not taking advantage of.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   Well, let me see.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.920]   I'm going to go to something not Chrome.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.360]   No, it's not doing it in the chat room program.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.880]   It only does it when I'm in Chrome, but it is a gesture.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.600]   I have to, yeah, I have to use two fingers on my track.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   I'm not getting that.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.360]   That's confusing as hell.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.280]   I don't go.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:25.200]   See, this is where software attacks.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   Oh, yeah, two fingers wipes.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.400]   So it just brings you back in the current tab.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.040]   Oh, Google in their back button, back swipe.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.360]   They don't want the back button, right?
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.760]   They don't want it.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.240]   They don't, they want to.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.600]   Well, Android has been pretty, pretty, loyal to the back button.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.920]   Hey, you got a weird game.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.400]   It doesn't always happen though.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.880]   It's so strange.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.000]   Maybe, oh, because I've gone back.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Or is it?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   No, there it is.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It's the right.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.160]   Oh, it's so strange.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.560]   And I don't know what it's doing.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:05.240]   So it's just, it's an opaque gesture that's doing something that I don't know about.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   I'm Google.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.000]   So answering Mr. McGrumpy.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Oh, no, don't.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Okay, I'm waiting.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Don't give him the crunty.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.240]   But, okay, to get back to this viral thing, I think though, the fact that there's a, you
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.120]   know, going back and forth on Twitter, then you create a Google Doc that takes his text
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.280]   and responds to it.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.880]   This is wonderful.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:29.040]   This is, I know for you, this is probably a lot of spilcus and a lot of angst.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   But it's, but it, but for the rest of us, what it is, is it's a dialogue and it brings
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   the book to life.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.680]   I agree as long as it were civil and not personal, vindictive, and death.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.440]   I wish you weren't.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.040]   The form, the form, I agree.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   That's what I want.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   That's where I crave as a discussion.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.840]   I had a great discussion about ideas, not about people.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.360]   But yeah, that's what, that's what, that's what Megan's point is.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.600]   That's what books should be.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   And they're bad at it.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.760]   She said, what books do is contain ideas.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.920]   They're meant economically to contain an idea.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.200]   And that's true.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.280]   And I confess my hypocrisy for doing it in a book about publicness, especially.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.040]   She said books are bad for sharing.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.560]   And I said, well, yeah, you, that's the best criticism I've heard of my book is I wrote
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.520]   a book about sharing and a form bad for sharing.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   She says the system has also been generally designed to advance books within the marketplace
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   to sell them.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.360]   Rather than the marketplace of ideas.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.560]   Now your book is all about ideas.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.720]   It aims at publicity rather than publicness, at selling objects rather than propelling
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   the arguments they contain.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.520]   Most idea driven books like yours, tread a well worn path book pitched, book bought,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.120]   book written, book published, book shelved, book reviewed, book ranked, book removed
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.400]   from the shelves.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   So as to make room for more copies of battle him of the tiger mother.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.160]   But you've done something different, Jeff.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.120]   Of course, naturally you would.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:57.200]   And I think we should celebrate the fact that Mr. McGrumpy attacked you because it gave
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.880]   us this whole dialogue around it, which it would normally not have happened.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.880]   Right.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   I could imagine others attacking me.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.880]   That's fine.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.320]   But then what she did was inspire me to talk about something I've been contemplating for
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:13.160]   a while, which I write about on my blog, a second or third post down, which is that I
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.800]   wish there were a company that allowed.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.880]   Let's say that, you know, I'm not, I'm not Seth Golden.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.120]   I can't say, step my fingers and say a thousand people come see me and pay to see me in Atlanta.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.040]   But what if I got together with some really good authors, you know, maybe some fellow
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.280]   Utopians like Clay Shurkey, if I were honored?
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.040]   I haven't discussed this with him.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.600]   And we said, Hey folks, want to hear what we're talking about next and help us do it?
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.120]   And want to help us, you know, support that.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.560]   You know, we're not going to lose money on taking an auditorium to do that or space to
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.560]   do that.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.240]   Well, you could go to a Kickstarter and you could say, you want to hear us?
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.680]   And if enough people say yes, fine.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.000]   If enough people don't, then you now risk.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.600]   And then you come together in an event that could be led by the problem now is the authors
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.200]   are going to do more and more performance and speaking to make their living.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:03.360]   They should do more of it before they write, I think, to have a big impact on what they
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.800]   do.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   But they're in no control of events.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.480]   They wait for speakers, agencies who don't do junk.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:13.720]   They wait for conferences that rip you off and rip off the people who come.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.520]   So what if there were a means by which authors and thinkers and talkers could not unlike
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:23.760]   you starting a network could create their own events and you can record those events.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.040]   You can stream those events.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.080]   You can, you can use those events to pay for things.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.560]   You can use those events to advance ideas.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.840]   You can use those events for whatever you want.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.960]   So you say the book is actually in your post a byproduct.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.800]   It's not actually, you know, and I think that really is gets to the fundamental thing I
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.840]   want to ask you is maybe the book is just a dead form.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.840]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.920]   You know, there are reasons to have a book and maybe it's still because I'm still back
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.560]   in the in the breadth of the set form for ideas as opposed to say a novel.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.720]   I mean, obviously the book is a novel makes sense.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.200]   The book, the book is biography makes sense.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.600]   The book is a forum for ideas is you're experiencing it constrain.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.240]   Well, those as Gina just said, the book is a biography would be so much richer if we
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:10.360]   could see and here's two jobs in it and see and hear those who talk about him in it.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.600]   And see people link to it and add to it in neat ways after it's out to say, I remember
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.360]   this story and I remember that story or to fact check it or whatever.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.680]   But this is what we're doing right here.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.160]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.600]   It's silly to say I'm an author.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.120]   So I am I am enclosed in a 600 pages of dead tree.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:34.600]   You are a persona and you you well, I don't mean in an historical sense.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   Well, even not me.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.880]   Or we want to talk about one person.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:43.040]   Somebody who is an idea person and yeah, see, this is the problem, by the way.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.560]   And I think this is what holds it back, not with everybody, but some is and it's the same
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   problem people have with blogging.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.400]   It's like, Oh my God, it's all about me.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.840]   I'm all it's just talking about me.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.120]   And so there's some feeling that if you do this, you become now personality.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.280]   You are no longer, you know, William Shakespeare, George Plimpton.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.200]   But I don't think that that's really in the future.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.280]   I don't think that's sensible.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.800]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:09.400]   The whole reason that we do this as we do it with a live chat room and live is because
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.320]   we want to create dialogue and conversation, not a monologue.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.200]   Well, I mean, Gina to me is a great example, but to if you look at if you look at the
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:24.120]   ideas and service and things like that, right, the book, well, you Leo too, you your books
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   is set down.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.480]   They make permanent some bit of advice, but what's the essence of you?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.240]   Well, that's why I stopped writing books.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.040]   It seems you want to show.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   Right.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.800]   And people say, why don't you blog more?
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.200]   I finally came to I felt bad.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.720]   And then finally we're like, Oh, I'm not a writer.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   I'm a talker.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.640]   No, I got nothing to write.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   I'm a talker.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.920]   Gina, what do you think there's disadvantages to this format, by the way, because it's completely
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   impermanent.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   Yes.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   Yes.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   It's not indexable.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.320]   It's not referable back in time.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.440]   It just it kind of goes out there and and and evaneses.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.840]   I think we could fix parts of that, but Gina, what's your best form for what you do best
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   and love to do?
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.320]   I thought about this a lot.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.080]   The life hacker book is a product that came from five years or actually more than five
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.520]   years now, because Adam Adam continued with it of blogging.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.520]   Right.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.000]   So I can't if someone asked me what's life hacker about, I'm not going to say you need
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.960]   to read five years of 20 posts a day.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   Right.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.960]   I'm like, here's this book.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   Right.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.120]   This book was came from conversations and post that we, you know, conversations that
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.760]   we had hours and hours and hours and thousands of people over years.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.360]   And it kind of encapsulates the main ideas.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   It's edited.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   It's good.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.560]   So I think that there's a really a lot of a lot of value in that.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   But like you said, it is dead.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.080]   And I struggle with this with the wavebook too.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.480]   You know, it's like Google's creating this platform for conversations and collaborative,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.640]   you know, living documents.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:46.360]   And I was writing a dead document about this platform, but I was kind of doing it in public
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.280]   and wanted to do it in that platform.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.560]   I tend to do much better on the web.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.960]   I'm much better writer and kind of tweeter, Google plus or whatever you want to say.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.880]   I'm much better at conversations online with Permalinks.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   So conversations with Permalinks.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.760]   And that really are important to me.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.000]   Like I love doing the show, but I hate that it's not permalinkable or we don't have a
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.760]   full transcript or it's not easy to, you know, it's not as easy to skip to a certain
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   part of the conversation.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   So I love the permalink.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.080]   I like, I like writing on the web.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:17.000]   But I think that the, the book as a product as a nicely packaged, edited, fully thought
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   out, fully peer reviewed and collaborated piece of work is really important too.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.800]   Because 10 years from now, I'm going to say Jeff talked about this idea of public, been
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   his book, public parts.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   And here it is.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   And it's on this page.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.960]   And that permanence, that archiving.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.480]   And this book is going to inform ideas that I definitely, you know, I'm definitely going
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.800]   to inform ideas that I have 10 years ago.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.960]   Because I can't, I don't do that.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.960]   I should do that.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.960]   I'd love to do that.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   I just don't.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   That's not my medium.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   And, but what this medium is good for is emotion.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   Yes.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.880]   You know, and, and I just kept, that's what I kind of like.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.840]   I mean, I think it's just more communicative if, if it is more evanescent.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.600]   And the dialogue ends when, you know, an hour later, it's, it's fish wrap.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.240]   Yeah, but you know, Buzz machine means so much more to me now that I've gotten to know
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.280]   Jeff and get to talk to him in person every day.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.200]   Yeah, they go hand in hand, don't they?
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   Absolutely.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   They do.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   Absolutely.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.720]   And that's what you're saying, Jeff, I guess with this idea of author.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.720]   It's part of it.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.320]   I think that, you know, the other thing you could do if you have a platform like this,
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.000]   you have a platform for people to create their own events, whether that's the author
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.160]   or speaker or idea person do it, or whether that's the group, don't we all hate conferences?
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.480]   Don't we just want to get together?
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.240]   What if you had a structure where you said a little bit different from meetup, you had
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.200]   a structure like this said, listen, I wonder if there's a critical mass of people to get
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.480]   together to talk about new strategies for that neutrality.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   Making it up.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480]   Great.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.520]   And, and could we get enough people who would come in and support such an event and pay
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.280]   just enough to pay for the space and we could do what we want to and we can all meet each
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.120]   other and yada, yada, yada, yada, yada.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.160]   I think you could turn around this whole conference business and make it run by the people in
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.760]   the room rather than by the people behind it or the stage.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.760]   That's another conference.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.720]   You just reinvented the end conference.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.520]   You need, right, but you need a business platform for this.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.080]   What I want is this platform.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.680]   I want the Kickstarter piece that says, is that always the problem for pay?
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.240]   I think it's, I think it's a new Kickstarter.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.640]   And you can say, are there enough people who pay and do we have somebody who will come
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.880]   in, we know what their fee is to rent the venue and set up the mics and take the tickets
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880]   and do all that stuff.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.520]   And so we know exactly what the cost of such a gathering would be.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.080]   We make it or we don't make it.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:28.720]   It's such a shame that you have to put so much creativity into monetization.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.000]   It just, it's merely to make it possible, right?
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.360]   It doesn't really have anything to do with it.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.600]   But if you do, look at all the things that can happen.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   I agree.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   You need to.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.000]   I keep thinking Kickstarter is an amazing thing.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.480]   I mean, you know, maybe, you know, the next wave, so to speak and go away.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.080]   But I think there's something really important there.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.680]   Much band company getting a million dollars in pre-org.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.440]   Means that he's built this product and company on his customer's capital.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.680]   He didn't have to build big money from anybody.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.360]   His customers gave him the capital.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.920]   It's just syncopated the timing.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   Right.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   Right.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.800]   And it's a pop up manufacturing company with no infrastructure.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.360]   He can close it six months later and the world's no worse for it.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   That's new.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.200]   And so a platform has such incredible power.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.440]   The risk, I think, in this new world, if your Google or your Facebook is the wealth is now
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.200]   going to be ill-distributed to go to the platforms.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.200]   I'm excited.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   I do.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.240]   And it makes me want to write more, though, Gina, because I do need to have it be indexable
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.800]   and searchable and permanent.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.280]   Listen, me too.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.360]   But I tell you, I haven't been blogging very much either.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.920]   It's just too easy to throw up a post on Twitter or to do the show with you two.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.080]   I mean, there are so many times when I'm like, I should really write a post about that discussion
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   we had on the show.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.480]   But when you've had it and I just don't take the time to do it.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.120]   I'm the same way.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   So I've used my blog.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   Okay.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.080]   So here's the question is, should we just pause it that if somebody's really going to
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.240]   succeed in this space, that they have to be able to do these multimedia capabilities.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:04.720]   They need to do use the right medium for the right expression, but need to use them all
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.520]   because no one medium suffices.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.360]   That's why we teach our journalism students through the wall.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.360]   There you go.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.160]   And some complained about having to have eight arms and their right to complain because
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   it's hard, but if they don't have the full power to do it all, then we leave them.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.960]   The true the true stars will do it all.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   Yes.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.840]   The really successful appropriately, appropriately.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.760]   And yes, they won't make a video for the sake of making the video.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.680]   They won't make a podcast because they have to make a podcast.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.240]   They'll say, you know, the best way to express this.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:42.440]   It's like when in the old days of theater, you had to be able to sing, dance and act.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.840]   I dare you to start dancing right now, Leo.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.000]   I think I think it will or uniform around the officer.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Crop.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.840]   He offers a craft.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.840]   K craft.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.840]   Yo.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.840]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.840]   We'll come back with more.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.840]   It's so much fun.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840]   Dramatic.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840]   You're fun.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.840]   All right.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   That's kind of.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   Thank you.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   I need to do that.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:10.160]   I need to find out to be Fred Norris.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.560]   And she looks like it too.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.840]   But you know, it's funny.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.120]   This conversation is great because it's something that's been going around and around and around
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.280]   for me is that we created a platform for just one form.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.560]   And I keep thinking we need text.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.360]   We need a website that has to we need to find a way to make all those forms live.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.280]   Well, Leo, one thing you could do, not to delay our sponsor message.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.800]   They're going to bring it back to money.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:35.080]   But the question is, can video be formed differently so that it has permalinks within
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.080]   it, right?
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.320]   Just as Dave Weiner has paragraph links in his blog.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.000]   Yeah, we've talked a lot about that.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   In fact, Alex Lindsey has you know what's sad?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.320]   Quick time had that capability and Apple took it out.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   No.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.360]   Apple decided that nobody's using it.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.400]   So it had hyper linking.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.600]   And actually you see that on YouTube's frequently.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.000]   Yes, you've had that, right?
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   You can do it.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.680]   I don't think it's being done well, but you could do it.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   See, I think you could crowdsource it.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.240]   And I'll ask the chatroom, a chatroom.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.200]   Would you go to the effort of annotating?
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.080]   That's what I'd hoped.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.640]   I hope we could crowdsource it.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.560]   Yeah, that's why we have a wiki.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.240]   And the show notes are on the wikis.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.560]   And I had really hoped that we could create a cadre of people who would do that.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.880]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.880]   Maybe that's the way to do it.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   You lazy chatroom.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   What have you done?
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Get to work.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   Geez.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   Get to work.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.880]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.160]   This is, as always, brilliant.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.280]   When you get great people together like Gina and Jeff, you just get great conversations.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.280]   So thank you guys.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.240]   Take a break, come back in a second, talk more about, yes, Google.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.160]   But first, let's talk about Ford.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.800]   We're having barbecues.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.640]   I think November 13th is our first one.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   There's going to be one in December.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.640]   Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   We're going to sit.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.160]   We've got a permit from the pedal in the police.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.680]   And we're just, I'm going to wear this outfit.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.480]   And I'm going to stand out here and say, you can't go here.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   We got a barbecue.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.040]   Bring in the Ford, escapes the edges.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.040]   The Ford Focus.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040]   Bring that over there.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   Put that over there.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:07.240]   And I have all the 2012 Ford, so you can see the Ford Sync and the My Ford Touch.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.000]   You know these new 2012 Ford Focus, you could put a USB 3G key in there.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.320]   And it turns the whole thing.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.560]   It's a cute Wi-Fi access spot with wheels.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.040]   So you're driving along.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.800]   And people in the car have Wi-Fi.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.440]   I mean, it's just doing so many amazing things.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.280]   And it's not just sync in My Ford Touch.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.920]   I mean, the great engines, they have all electric now, hybrids.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.640]   And the gasoline engines are more fuel efficient.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.600]   They're just incredible torque, fuel economy, and they're diesel.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.240]   And these things like this, like the safety belts with airbags built in to protect the
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   kids.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:51.760]   I could go on and on the adaptive cruise control, active park assist.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.160]   My key, if you've got kids, Jeff and I all know this one.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:02.760]   My key gives them a special key that places limits on speed, the maximum volume of the
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:09.240]   audio system, and the low fuel light comes on sooner.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.160]   Because as we know, kids will drive to zero.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.200]   So instead of coming on at 50 miles, it goes on when you've got 75 miles left, just to
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.080]   remind them, I just, it's things like this.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.080]   I just love it.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.960]   If you want to find out more, go to your Ford dealer.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.440]   Take a look at the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.440]   That's my next car.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.480]   I'm waiting for the electric, the all-electric Ford Focus.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.960]   But you can also go to Ford.com/technology.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   Unbelievable.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.680]   This is a 21st century company that's rethinking autos in the same way that we're kind of rethinking
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.360]   media here.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.680]   So yeah, I think a multimedia, I mean, that's where the, it's interesting.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.320]   I think Jeff Bezos is thinking along these lines, otherwise why may this jump from eink
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.560]   to a tablet?
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.160]   Well, and what's Google+ doing is trying to intuit the content, right?
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.960]   I did just turn to me that what you could, the way you could harness the chatroom, I
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:03.920]   love you chatroom, is that if they just put hashtags in the discussion while we're talking,
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.520]   and associate that with the time codes.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.040]   Jeff, we're way ahead of you, although we're not doing it yet.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:15.120]   If you go to twit.tv, you'll notice there's a scroll bar underneath the video and that
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.440]   we, I've called for several years called the river.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.880]   I wrote a blog post on this one.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.680]   Thank God I can refer back to it.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   And the idea was exactly that, that it's a curated stream of textual content related
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:32.640]   to what you're watching created by the chatroom, the hosts and others curated by our chat
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.560]   mods and other people.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:41.600]   You have tags in it so that you can sort it or filter it as needed.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.960]   There's hot links and so forth.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.760]   So the whole idea of this was it's not happening yet because, well, there's always technical
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   issues.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.320]   In fact, there's nothing going across the ticker right now.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.200]   But that's what this black bar is made at a very simple level.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.760]   If you just point to if somebody, you know, one more thing for Alina to do, you point
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.360]   to one of the stories in the run now that we're talking about right now, Bingo, that
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.840]   says that that's what this part of the show is about.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   Exactly.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   Until I go off and attend.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.840]   Exactly.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.840]   No, exactly.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.680]   And then, and then what we need to do is have people doing it this instead of the wiki.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:16.280]   And of course it would be captured and then and then index, but, but could annotate it.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.600]   So they could say, you know, as just talking, here's an interesting article related and
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   so forth and so on.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.760]   Or we have a standing lead button.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   Break.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.240]   You can have a filter.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.920]   No, at least a few photos of people's burritos saying, Hey, you know, I listen to twig and
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.920]   look what happened.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   I'm Mr. Chipotle now.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.080]   So take down notices.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.320]   This is from search engine land.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.480]   Who do you think has issued this year?
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.640]   The most take down notices from YouTube.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.640]   Would it be Viacom?
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.800]   Would it be NBC?
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.560]   Would it be CBS?
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.520]   No, it'd be the US government.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.520]   Scary.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.240]   Five thousand nine.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.240]   This isn't your number.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   Is it Jeff?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.240]   Nope.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.120]   Five thousand nine hundred fifty content removal requests.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.760]   Now these are, this isn't just YouTube.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.120]   This is from what?
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120]   From removal?
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   Of course.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.960]   I think up 70% from the last reporting period.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.000]   Number two is India.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.240]   This is a, this is a transparency report that Google does.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.120]   I wish we had more transparency on what's being made opaque.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.960]   I mean, they say that they got requests from local law enforcement agency to remove YouTube
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:30.080]   videos, police brutality, which they didn't do requests to remove from local law enforcement
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.960]   to remove videos, allegedly the Fami law enforcement officials.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:34.960]   They didn't do it.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   So we know that they didn't do.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.960]   This is what about.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.960]   So these are mostly like take accounts down, things like that.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.720]   They're not YouTube videos.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.200]   This is a defamation.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   I can't figure this out.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.600]   If you look at the full chart, there are things they took down from email.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.880]   Now how the hell do you do that?
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   We removed ads.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.720]   We violated AdWords.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:59.480]   We're with, YouTube was inaccessible during China, so we didn't have to do anything there.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.320]   This is the first time they've received one or more content removal requests from the
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.400]   Cook Islands.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:11.720]   A single court order from France removed 180 items from Google groups.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:17.800]   In data user requests increased 38% India, state and local law enforcement to remove
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.480]   YouTube videos that displayed protests against social leaders, or use defensive language
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.240]   in reference to religious leaders.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.000]   We declined the majority of these requests.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.840]   I love the transparency here.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   Isn't it wonderful?
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:33.720]   If you click on United States, as you get to it, you'll see the chart of the kinds of
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.720]   things that are done.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.960]   But again, without much transparency from that point on.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.560]   Well, and probably they can't, right?
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.560]   I know that they can't.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.840]   But even if they could describe it more, you want to know, well, here's the scary thing
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.840]   today.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:50.480]   Justice Department today, Mika's free tweet on this, put out a new proposed regulation
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.440]   that says that the government can lie to you in FOIA requests and deny that a document
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.120]   that exists, even if it exists.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.120]   Ha!
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   Ha!
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.120]   Ha!
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.600]   That's for our security, Jeff.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:10.360]   And the fact, the very fact that you mentioned that now has to be expunged from the record.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:16.680]   And so as Mika says, you know, on Mika was a big supporter of Obama, take away his
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.400]   rewards for transparency.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:27.040]   YouTube defamation, privacy and security, government criticism, the US has removed or
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:32.520]   requested that a video that criticizes the federal government be removed.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:38.240]   It was a police executive, et cetera, not a court.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.400]   They don't, but they don't say whether it was removed or not.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   But there was a--
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.640]   I thought when I ran local sites, police were the worst at coming and an issue in subpoenas
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.120]   because they know how to do it.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.160]   And it was always somebody in the force who's criticizing the chief and the chief goes after
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   the online service.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.720]   It just happened like crazy.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:00.600]   Google images, web search, Google groups, privacy, impersonation, government criticism.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.040]   I sure would like to know what that video is.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.040]   Exactly.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.040]   So I'm going to say pull down a video that criticizes the government.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:12.320]   Is that the essence of free speech?
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.280]   I'm just, I'm shocked, to be honest.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.200]   Well, some great journalist should be going and getting more stories on this.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   What is that video?
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   What could that video be?
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:27.320]   Is it part of our, absolutely part of our constitution that we should be allowed to
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.880]   criticize the government?
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.880]   Yep.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.760]   I mean, I'm not saying threaten the government, but they've got violence, hate speech, national
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.760]   security.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.040]   We have categories for that.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   This is government criticism.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.000]   And there's one item listed there.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.480]   I don't like the government.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   I hope somebody digs into that.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.480]   I'd like to know what that is.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.840]   That should be showing up under the United States.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.240]   Interesting.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.560]   And then user data requests.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.640]   So let's go look at that.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:58.320]   The government requests for disclosure of user data from Google accounts or services.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:05.200]   93% of which were fully or partially complied with.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   5,950.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.200]   Hmm.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.760]   Well, it's obvious that Google's publishing this with a little bit of agenda.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.320]   We hope this tool will shine some light on the appropriate scope and authority of government
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   requests to obtain user data.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.320]   Wow.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.680]   I mean, they pretty much outright said in the blog post that their goal is to be transparent
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.640]   about this so that we can start revisiting the policy that was enacted about this 25
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.160]   years ago before we email us.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   Wow.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160]   Wow.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.960]   And let's hope that more companies do this.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   No.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.040]   Google is planning to closely link an upcoming music download store with its Google+ social
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.040]   network.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.200]   We've heard this before and again and again.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.720]   In fact, I thought by now we'd have heard of this.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.760]   Well, this is the extra that they were talking about.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760]   This is the twist.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.760]   The one more thing.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   Oh, it's the twist.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.760]   Oh, you're the twist, right?
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   That's what they called it.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.200]   But they haven't done it yet.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.120]   The twist appears to be that you can buy a song and then you can share it for one free
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.000]   listen with your friends.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   One.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.360]   Well, but it's like radio play, right?
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.760]   It's not bad.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.200]   It's so then your friends can say, I want to listen to this more.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.000]   Well, then you can buy it.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.480]   It's individual radio play.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.520]   Now if I share a song, can each friend hear it once?
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.480]   So like I share it with 10,000 friends and each of them gets it once.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   I think so.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.480]   Oh, that's all right.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   That's a good question.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   That's got to work like that.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   One friend would be crazy.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   Oh, be crazy.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.440]   One play, one friend, that's it.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.120]   You can only see it's all just reports anyway.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.040]   It's not fully confirmed.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.040]   But that would be a neat model.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.000]   I don't know if it's revolutionary or anything, but it's kind of cool.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   It is kind of neat.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   It's kind of neat.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   It's energizing the Google+ emphasis, you know, things, right?
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   Yes.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Being able to share.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   Yep.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.240]   Google+ is going to integrate with Blogger.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.120]   Maybe I will start writing more.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   Well, the first thing they're doing is just integrating the profiles.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.120]   Oh.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.960]   They're all terrible Blogger profiles that no one ever fills in can now be your Google
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960]  + page.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   It only makes sense.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   But you're absolutely right, Leo.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   The thing that I want to--
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.840]   I want to blog from Google+, and they asked me when I was out there, why do you put up
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   things on different platforms?
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.080]   And I said, I can't write on Google+, because I can't do links.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.920]   I can't do what's responsible.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   And they know that--
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   Tiltus, that.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   This is obvious.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.920]   They've got Blogger.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:22.240]   They've got every tool they need is right there to publish rich posts on Google+.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.840]   You know, Mike Elgin does that.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.160]   He does a newsletter, which is a great newsletter, free newsletter.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.800]   And the way he does it is he writes it on Google+.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.040]   He posts them, and then it aggregates them into a newsletter.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.120]   We need more little of those pieces so that I can create a blog which you can subscribe
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.600]   to or you can go read.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.920]   And maybe tie that to YouTube.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.560]   I mean, Google's the only one that can do all of this, I think.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.800]   You should have media throughout.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   Everywhere.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:55.160]   You should use spreadsheets and slideshows and videos and links throughout.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.120]   And it should be the richest content publishing platform, the easiest and richest you could
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   imagine.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.320]   They went to the easy by making it in.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.440]   Anything else you want to talk to before we go to our--
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.160]   Are we there already?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.040]   Well, I'm doing a new thing.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.440]   I'm trying to make the shows a little bit shorter.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   Oh.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   OK.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.920]   You got to tell me this, Leo.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   So I shut up.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.360]   It should not in any way impact how you perform.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.560]   I'm just going to kind of keep an eye on the time and try to keep things moving along.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.120]   I've got this little button.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   You thought I was joking.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.120]   I have this little--
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120]   I did think you were joking.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   You just really had orange button?
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.120]   There it is.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   Actually, it's green.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   So I push--
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   Nice.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120]   Nice.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.120]   My staff.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   They love me.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.440]   They say, OK, Leo, just tap this.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   And it will start at timer.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440]   And I'm looking at a timer.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.920]   We're one hour, two minutes, and 25 seconds into the show.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.200]   It is 2.15.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.920]   So I think if I start wrapping now, we'll get out of here in time for TNT.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.600]   We'll have an hour and 15 minute show, which is kind of my goal.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.400]   You know, it was always our goal to make the show.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.080]   In the earliest days, in 2005 when we did this, people kept saying, oh, don't make it
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.280]   longer than 70 minutes because we want to burn it to a CD.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.880]   We don't get that request anymore.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.560]   That, we don't get anymore.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.800]   But I think that's a nice time.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.600]   Of course, on the other hand, there are plenty of people who say, no, no, I want it
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.600]   to be longer.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.280]   Mostly what people want I've discovered is they want it to be exactly the length of
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.800]   their commute, no shorter.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   Right.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.000]   And that's how people want it.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.720]   All right, we're going to quickly mention our friends at Vast.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.400]   And then I will get our tip tool and number of the week.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.760]   I was going to make a video-- and I forgot to do this-- of that ion drive because I
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.800]   got a clamp in the car and everything.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.120]   And show me running into a car.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.720]   And you can hear the screams of alarm from my Android phone.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720]   But I forgot to do that.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720]   I'll do that next week.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.480]   That was my tip, my tool last week.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.360]   Vast conference-- actually, this is a very good tool that we've started to use a lot.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.120]   V-A-S-T conference.com, I'll log in.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.360]   But don't show the screen yet.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.760]   Not going to show it, but tell me when.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   Because I don't know.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760]   What happened?
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   I did this last time.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760]   Phone numbers.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760]   Phone numbers, right?
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   Can I show it now?
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.760]   You can show this now.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   This is the dashboard.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   You can manage your calls.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.640]   I think I'm hiding the numbers.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.600]   You can, in a conference call, record each participant individually.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.760]   You can add their name.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.300]   There's this great account administration center.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.880]   If you are doing conference calls, you have a-- they call it technical term as a conference
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.240]   bridge, right?
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.600]   Where you're setting up these conference calls, Vast is absolutely the best conference
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   bridge I've ever used.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.280]   Not free, but very affordable.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:42.160]   And in fact, you can use it for free right now for two conference calls, no commitment.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.560]   Just use our promo code Twig.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.600]   You get a toll-free dial-in number or a regular dial-in number.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.800]   You get the conference code and so forth.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   Now don't show it.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   Hide it.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.000]   Because I'm now going to click on this is the most recent call that I did.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   Yeah, that shows phone numbers.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.880]   So let me zoom in a little bit.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   So I hide the numbers.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.040]   There we go.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.240]   So hosts attendees, where they called from, the time, the length of the call.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.480]   It's just really, really-- there's more on this page that you're not seeing.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.480]   It's really great.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.320]   And what's great is you have recordings of it all.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.400]   It doesn't use VoIP.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.240]   It uses the actual phone system so you don't get any weird latency or sound.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:26.080]   It's very-- if you want to do professional calls where you're not embarrassed, this
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.280]   is the way to do it.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.440]   Vastconference.com.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:35.360]   Use the offer code Twig when you sign up and you'll get two free calls.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.120]   Actually, it's more complicated than that, but it's basically 300 minutes of calling
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.400]   at Vastconference.com.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.920]   They support up to 300 callers at once, which is very slick.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.720]   And all the calls are recorded as MP3 files, which you can listen to or download later.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.920]   Pricing is very affordable.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920]   It really is the way to do it.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:59.160]   If you're using a conference bridge, do the pro thing.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.320]   At Vastconference.com, we thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.560]   Jean Trapani has a tip of the week, Gina.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:13.920]   My tip this week is a little bit sad for old school power users' search.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.000]   Google search has dropped the use of the plus operator, which you'd use to say do an
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   end search.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.520]   This word plus another word.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.520]   Very strange.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   Not really sure why.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:30.520]   I mean, most likely the reason why is because Google plus, which uses plus as another kind
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.760]   of operator, will probably be integrated into search somehow.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.280]   But this has literally been the plus operator and the minus operator and a few other advanced
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.040]   operators have been in the Google search since the very beginning.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.480]   They always said you don't need them.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.320]   They always said, oh, you don't need to use a bullions.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.640]   It just will just do it for you.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   We'll just do it for you.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   We'll write, write exactly.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.720]   But there are certain, especially journalists and coders and super webs have you say, no,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.440]   I really do want this crazy sounding word in my search results.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.160]   That's when you add the plus sign.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.520]   If you're used to using the plus, if you do a search using a plus sign, you'll actually
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.880]   get a message from Google now that says, hey, if you want to do the search, use quotes.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880]   That's my tip of the week.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.320]   Embrace the quotation marks.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.720]   You want to do a search where you absolutely want all the words in your search query to
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.040]   appear in the results.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.640]   You only want results with the exact words you've typed, use quotations, and that will
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.640]   do it for you.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:25.480]   I'm really interested to see how the plus sign will be used in the future because no
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.040]   doubt they're reserving it for something related to Google Plus, I would imagine.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.400]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   That's why.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.000]   Show me all the posts too.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.440]   That mentioned Leo, and I would use the plus sign with your name or something like that.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.800]   Can they come up with another character then if that's what they're going to do?
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.800]   I mean, yeah.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.520]   I guess when they made the decision to use the plus sign instead, they at sign, which
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.160]   is a Twitter thing and an email thing, they kind of...
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.160]   But you could have a different sign for the Boolean.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.160]   Right.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160]   Oh, I see what you mean, right.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.160]   But you know, quotation marks are always exact phrase searches.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.000]   I could use it for song lyrics or quotations.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   I use that all the time, yeah.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.680]   Yeah, I use that a lot too.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.760]   But this is actually you have to quote, quote, "around each word."
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.960]   So it's a little bit of a pain if you use the plus operator.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.200]   I'll admit, I use the plus operator less and less in the past few years, but everyone's
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.400]   in a while busted out if I'm looking for something very specific.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.480]   And I'm like, no, I didn't mean that Google.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480]   I meant what I typed.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.040]   Well, that would be good.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.360]   Jay Calhoun says, why not uppercase A and D?
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.960]   I think some search engines did use that.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:30.960]   That's right.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   Capital or capital A.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   We need more characters.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960]   Nobody.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.480]   I think what they probably found is in their metrics, nobody used it.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480]   Right.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   That's probably true.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480]   I'm sure the metrics.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   I learned this week.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480]   This is not my number because it's not a number.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   It's a character.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.920]   I learned this week that what's it called?
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   The Mark D'Arne.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:55.880]   I can't do any French, but the Mark of irony is a backwards question mark.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.400]   Oh, yes.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.920]   And it was intended originally to note snark or irony.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   Right.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   The irony mark.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.920]   I love that.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   Right.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.520]   And someone meant to be on Twitter that there was an effort to do a left-leaning italic
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   to note irony.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.720]   Couldn't we all use that in Twitter for the irony starved?
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   I think we need this.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.280]   Yeah, we really need this on Twitter.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   Don't we all?
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   Get this.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:25.040]   It was first used in the 1580s and then furthered by French poet Al-Kante de Blom in the 19th
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.240]   century.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.120]   So apparently there's been a confusion about irony for a long time.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.840]   He'd be getting trouble for irony all the time.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.840]   I know somebody who got fired for irony.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.000]   He said something he shouldn't have said.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.840]   No, no, I was saying that ironic.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.840]   I'm British.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.800]   You Americans don't get it.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:49.400]   You needed the rhetorical question mark or per connotation point invented in the 1580s.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.440]   And it was used in the end of a question that did not require an answer, a rhetorical question.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440]   It's used.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440]   This is according to Wikipedia.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.800]   It's used out in the 17th century.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.760]   But we want it back.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   We want it back.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.760]   And then there's also the Interro Bang, which you see, exclamation mark and a question mark.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   The irony mark.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   The irony.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.080]   Wow, that's really great.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.840]   But how can you make it happen?
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.840]   Is there a...
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.840]   It's an ASCII.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840]   It's an ASCII.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840]   It's in the ASCII.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   You can cut and paste that.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.440]   But the problem is some of the places won't see it, it depends on whether the font supports
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.160]   it in the display.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.680]   It's in Unicode.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.000]   To E, to E. To E. To E. To E. To E.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   To E or not to B.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.200]   Yeah, just remember that for the year.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.800]   To E or not to E.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   Huh.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.160]   The pair connotation point.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   I love it.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160]   Speaking of...
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160]   I know.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:49.760]   I'm wasting anywhere else.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.800]   So you have a number, Jeff?
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.800]   I have a number of the week.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.440]   The Pew internet and American life people who do just incredible, incredible work.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.560]   I think we're going to look back in history and be so grateful for the work they do on
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   our usage of things.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.800]   They did work on news and tablets.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.720]   And there's good news and bad news.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.440]   Matthew Inger did a good summary of this work on GigaOM.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:19.880]   77% of tablet users get some kind of news or 54% get news daily.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.600]   30% say they get more news than they did before because of the tablet.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.320]   But the bad news.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.200]   14% pay, only 21% say they would pay.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.960]   And here's the interesting thing to me.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.820]   3% of users get news not through applications but through browser.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:40.720]   Only 21% get news through brand specific browser apps.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.160]   I mean, I bought apps.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.140]   Otherwise, they use the browser.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.720]   So the whole notion that you're going to get this controlled world of news around the
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.960]   apps which I keep on decrying, well, probably not going to work.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.920]   It's probably the browser.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920]   Interesting.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.260]   So that was my numbers.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.200]   I agree.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.520]   By the way, there are other exclamation alternative exclamation or punctuation mark suggested.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520]   Oh boy.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.960]   We got to get Leo off this Wikipedia page.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   By Airvey Bazzin.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:15.920]   He wanted also a doubt point, a certitude point, an acclimation point, an authority point, an
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.080]   indignation point, and a love point.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   Oh, that's too good.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.080]   That's got to be a joke.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.520]   A love point.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.000]   Only in a French would they have a love point.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.040]   I would like to put the love point on this show right now.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.360]   I hearted this show.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.640]   Yes.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.960]   My tool of the week is not something probably that you want to use.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.560]   I think there's some Android users who are a little jealous of Siri and wish they had
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.480]   some Siri-like capability.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.840]   I still think the dictation in Android is pretty good.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.040]   It's not as good as Siri, though.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.760]   I have done head-to-head comparisons and really Siri is pretty remarkable.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:59.240]   But there is an app in very extreme alpha right now called Iris that you can download
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.160]   for free from the Android marketplace.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.080]   Just talk to Iris about anything.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.080]   She's mean.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   She's mean.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.080]   She's mean.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   Well, like what?
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080]   She yells at you.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.000]   She's the opposite of it's very sarcastic.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.920]   So if you ask a question, she says attitude.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.320]   Iris says attitude.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.320]   Attitude.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.080]   Well, some people like that, don't you think?
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.600]   Do we have a little Iris irony?
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.600]   By the way, that was I believe.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.200]   If you hate everything Macintosh, then I've got an app for you.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.720]   I'm sassy bob and you're watching XTA TV.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.360]   You're afraid that?
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.440]   She was the voice.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.440]   She should be.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.680]   I want her on my phone, sassy bob.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.800]   If you talk about the new iPhone 4S, then you probably heard about Siri.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.000]   A big marketing point for the 4S.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.320]   Siri is supposed to be a mobile assistant that you can talk about.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.800]   Can I scroll ahead?
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.240]   Did you talk about this at all about Android?
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240]   We did.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.240]   We talked about it.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.360]   We've Jason downloaded this.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.680]   What is XTA developers?
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.240]   I don't live in England.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.280]   Then why do you have a British accent?
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.880]   I don't have a favorite show.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.280]   You're a f***ing idiot.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.760]   You asked your Fasteries, Fasteries, Fasteries, Fasteries, Fasteries, Fasteries, Fasteries.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:10.960]   I think there's a certain joy to that.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:16.440]   Anyway, if you feel a little jealous that you don't have Siri on your Android phone,
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.440]   put Iris on your phone.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   Iris is good.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.440]   There's also speak to it.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.440]   There's several of them.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   There's Vlingo.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.720]   I've used Vlingo a lot, actually.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.920]   Vlingo works pretty well.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920]   I don't have to try to speak to it.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920]   What do you like about speak to it?
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.920]   Well, speak to it.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.480]   You have an avatar.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480]   And then you can change the avatar.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   Does it talk back to you?
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.720]   It talks back to you and it learns.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.640]   It's still in beta and they have a Kickstarter.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.440]   The company that put it together has a Kickstarter for funding to help them.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440]   That's cool.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.920]   And you can have Jane or your personal assistant.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920]   It's not bad.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:53.880]   I mean, it added a calendar appointment for me.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.280]   It tells me who Lea Laportes.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   Right.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.360]   These things, look, it's no question.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.960]   This is going to be an all phone soon.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.160]   But right now, Siri really owns this market.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.600]   And Siri should do a lot more, but at least we Android users have some choices.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.000]   Did you break down yet, Gina?
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.360]   No, but I'm close.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:18.400]   You know, I think between the camera and Siri, it's probably a good idea.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   It's worth it.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.400]   I need to say it.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   I need to get through it.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   I'll get through it.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.400]   I'll get through it.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   He did.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400]   Do you see Elton's post?
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   Oh, he just went after it.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   He said it's a bad phone.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   He said don't get it.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.520]   Well, he's had a horrible battery life issues.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.520]   And that is true.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.520]   He's looking like a buddy.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.200]   He had five reasons not to get the 4S.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:41.160]   Well, we'll have to get Mike on a twit and have him rail and rant and rave.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   Oh, oh.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:49.280]   Siri means ass in Japanese, according to Mike.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.280]   Just a thought.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.600]   Hey, thank you for being here.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.560]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.520]   His book, Public Parts, a must read.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.960]   In fact, we did a great triangulation with Jeff.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.120]   The reaction was just wonderful.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.720]   If you haven't seen it, go to twit.tv and download last triangulation episode.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   You're just so much fun.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.120]   I just want to talk to you all the time.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.360]   I love being around you more.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360]   More group hug.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   It was a little bit.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360]   It got a little sappy, actually.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360]   Again, I'm sorry.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360]   It was my fault.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   I went over war.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.360]   I went too far.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   Leo got creeped out.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   I had to listen to it.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   I have to listen to it.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360]   No, I'm just a little hard moment.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:29.040]   I figure if you have an hour with Leo, you got it.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.920]   I had to use that as the opportunity to say how much I love Leo.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.560]   No, it was so much fun.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   That was funny.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.280]   That's why he's wearing the cop beautiful and remind me that I'm going to stay in line
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]   or he's armed.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.480]   All I can say is I'm just glad these things don't live forever.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.520]   Who was that bad Leo?
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.920]   No, no, I'm kidding.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920]   It was great.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920]   I love it.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.920]   I love you, Jeff.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.920]   I was glowing inside.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.920]   Aww.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.080]   Anyway, I read Jeff's book.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.080]   It's worth it.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   Watch the triangulation.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.080]   Jeff joins us whenever he can for Twig, which is almost every week.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.560]   Gina Trappani is at Buzz.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.440]   I'm sorry, smarterware.org.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.200]   That's her blog and of course writes for many other blogs as well as the original life
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.800]   hacker which she created.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.960]   She's also the author of Think Up, which is an amazing app for Twitter analysis at ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   Check it out.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   Thank you so much, Gina.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   Thank you.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   It's a great show today.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.280]   By the way, as always, my favorite hour of the week.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:33.040]   39.08 says Shiri or Oshiri means but.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.480]   You can't even say Siri in Japanese.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.480]   So there.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   All right.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.840]   Now we have clarification.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.680]   We do this show every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern, 1,300.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.480]   I'm sorry, 2,000 UTC at twit.tv.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.480]   Please watch it.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.480]   If you can't watch live, don't worry.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.680]   We make audio and video versions available shortly after the show every single week.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.240]   TNT is coming up next.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.440]   As always, Monday through Friday, our tech news show with Tom Merritt, I, Azaktar and
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.440]   Sarah Lane triangulate.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.200]   Do we have a guest for triangulation or no?
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.200]   We're working on it.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.200]   We're working on it.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   We don't know Wednesday.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.200]   We may not.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.760]   You know, Wednesdays at four, we do triangulation if we can find somebody really good.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:16.320]   But if we can't, we're not going to waste time talking to somebody not really good.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320]   Exactly.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.320]   If it's not Jarvis quality, I don't want it.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   I don't want it.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:24.000]   If the person doesn't love Leo as much as I do.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   It's exactly right.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   We do a Leo test.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.800]   It's like the litmus test only is.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.160]   Anyway, thank you everybody for being here.
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.000]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   Bye bye.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   [MUSIC]
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   And here's a little Christmas.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   This is for Jean and Jeff.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   Yay, gooey Christmas.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   I had to say, but you know, the ratings are plummeting for the late.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   Oh, no.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   I kind of stopped.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   I didn't.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   It's like, what's not on now?
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   It's not on because of the world series.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   I want more singing and less plot because the plot's really are horrible.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   I love Sousa Sylvester.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   I love Sousa Sylvester, but Jamelyn's just amazing.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   Well, they also acknowledge their seniors this year now.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   Oh, are they going to graduate?
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   They're going to get rid of some of these kids?
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   That's what you wonder.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   Yeah, like the major characters are many of them are graduating.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   It's time for a new gang.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Do you want to date it or kill it?
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   What do you think, Gina?
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   The honey ones kind of been over for me a little bit too.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   I wouldn't kill it.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   I would just get somebody in there and just say make it about music more.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   Yeah, I would kill it.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   I would go to college.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   Lee goes to college.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   That's the 19-20 syndrome.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   Yeah, that's not good.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   That's not good.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   I would get really good new high school level stars in there and focus more on music and more
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   on the Sousa-ingers.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   And go with that.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   Love Sousa-ingers.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   Losingers.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   This is for you, Gina, I think.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   Oh, nice.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   The bricks are going in.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Awesome.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   There's some wild bricks.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   These are so great.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   But, Jerry Yard, Gina, right at eye level.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   Right on.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   To enter Panie Twig-Gleeke.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   I was wondering where that was going to wind up.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Isn't that great?
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   Go for Gina.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.360]   you Tony for taking that picture.
