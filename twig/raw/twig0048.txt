[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.520]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.400]   to show the covers of the Google versus the cloud and all
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.280]   of that stuff.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.080]   Jeff Jarvis is on assignment.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.040]   He's actually on a plane stuck somewhere over O'Hare Airport.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.400]   But good news is, of course, our very favorite Gina Trapani
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.840]   is here, as always.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.640]   Hello.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.360]   From a smarterware.org, she's also the author
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.200]   of the Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.840]   Hi.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.440]   How's it going?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.160]   Going really well.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   You're not doing any traveling.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.960]   Only one of you is allowed to travel at the time.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.560]   I try not to leave San Diego in the summer.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.480]   I don't blame you.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.000]   Perfect here.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.920]   It's perfect, beautifully.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.840]   And sitting in for Jeff, we're so happy to have Pete Cashmore,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.280]   the man in charge at Mashable.com.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.240]   Hey, Pete, how are you?
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.800]   I'm really good.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.200]   How are you?
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.560]   Great to talk to you.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.960]   Mashable is a great site for people who are following--
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.280]   what would you say it's the new internet?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.680]   Is that your beat?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.800]   Yeah, we tried to cover consumer internet.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.880]   So anything that's happening on the web,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.000]   we got it covered, particularly social media staff,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.760]   Twitter, Facebook, all the social sites.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.320]   That's really our focus.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.520]   It really is the place I go to find out what's going on online.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.560]   And in fact, you have your top story.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   We're very happy about this.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.000]   I don't know how you feel, Pete.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.480]   It's from Scotland.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.240]   Was Scotland even in the World Cup?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.800]   No.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.280]   So if you're Scottish, the tradition
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.120]   is to support anyone who's playing against England.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   Well, good news.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.160]   England did qualify, but so did the US.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.520]   And by beating Algeria--
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.080]   thank goodness.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.720]   And according to this story, you've
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.520]   been watching the Akamai-- or Adam, actually,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.120]   has been watching the Akamai Net Usage Index.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.360]   It could set a new internet traffic record.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.840]   Mm-hm.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.560]   There was also another game going at the same time.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.400]   So it kind of doubled up on the--
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.040]   Is this people streaming the game, or is it--
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.800]   What is everyone going online to check out what the buzz is
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.560]   going on right now?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.120]   At its peak, 11 million visitors per minute
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.760]   to the World Cup site.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.960]   Is that where they went?
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.360]   The World Cup hub?
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.440]   I don't know.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.320]   That's pretty remarkable.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.640]   Yeah, and everyone's Twittering about it.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.920]   It was 6% of tweets throughout that.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.160]   So it's pretty crazy.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   Wow.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.920]   They have a meter.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.160]   If you go to this site, they have a meter that
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.280]   is the world news consumption.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.440]   And there's light, normal, and heavy.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.440]   And it's pegged.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.400]   It went all the way to 11.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.640]   190% above normal.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.480]   Well, and of course, it's causing
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.080]   Twitter to go down quite a lot these times.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.920]   Oh, what a surprise.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.400]   Past week.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.000]   So that's more problems for them.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.040]   What a shock.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   Their status blog was down today.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   You're kidding.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.160]   I mean, it's a Tumblr blog.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.200]   So it's really-- it must have been Tumblr getting a lot of.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.680]   But yeah, I tried to check the status.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.520]   And I was like, not available.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.240]   Talk about a cascading effect.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.960]   So Twitter's down.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.080]   So people go to the status blog, because they've learned now
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.000]   that you're going to the status blog.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.080]   And they bring that down.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.520]   It started linking to the status blog
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.440]   from the like, farewell page.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.240]   That's probably what it was that Tumblr couldn't cope
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.640]   with that sudden rush of people coming to the farewell page.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.840]   So they need a status blog for the status blog.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.320]   And you need to put that on Google.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.960]   Exactly.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.000]   Somebody with a lot of bandwidth.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.680]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.240]   I've never seen Tumblr go down.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   That seems kind of unusual.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.960]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.640]   Yeah, they're pretty reliable.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.320]   They may get a little bit of a brain drain soon.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.440]   I see that this is kind of interesting.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.160]   Postorus, which I love a lot, was originally--
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.640]   it's a Y Combinator startup, pretty well financed.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.360]   P-O-S-T-E-R-O-U-S.com.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.080]   And I started using them when I was in China,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.880]   because you could email posts.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.600]   So you could use an iPhone to mail a picture,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.560]   because I couldn't get to Flickr from China, Facebook
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.080]   from China, or Twitter from China.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.640]   But I could always get to Postorus.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.720]   And then you can send-- so you email to Postorus.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.560]   And then Postorus feeds out to your other social media sites.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.760]   So I never thought of as a blog or an endpoint.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.400]   I always thought of as a pipeline.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   But apparently, they would like to become the next endpoint.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   They'd like to be Tumblr.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.840]   In fact, they say over the next 15 days,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.080]   Postorus is going to announce a different service daily
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.600]   that you can transfer your account from.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.760]   So today, it's Ning.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.240]   So what you do is you enter your Ning credentials in at Postorus.com,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.400]   and it sucks everything-- video, audio, pictures,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.080]   with posts, and makes a Postorus page with everything
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.360]   automatically.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.320]   But Ning and Postorus are kind of different, right?
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.560]   I mean--
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.240]   Yeah, it's an interesting choice.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.680]   Those are not two services that I would have said.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.520]   I should transfer from one to the other.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.440]   Ning might be vulnerable because they recently
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.160]   decided to charge.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yes, definitely.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   Low hanging fruit, I guess.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.200]   Postorus is free.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   But you've got to think that the next one is Tumblr,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.320]   because that's the most direct competition.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.200]   I really-- I love Tumblr.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.040]   I've been using Tumblr for a while.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.640]   I can see that you're reasoning, though, in China
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.480]   for wanting to email.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.760]   But yeah, I got a Tumblr pretty early.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.600]   And I just never tried Postorus, although it seems
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.080]   to be very popular.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.400]   I do Tumblr and Postorus.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.040]   And in fact, I was having Postorus update Tumblr.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.960]   So I was using Postorus completely as plumbing,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   almost like Yahoo pipes kind of.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.520]   I want a workflow diagram from Uleo for all the places
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.360]   where you actually input your status updates and blog posts.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.080]   And then all the places where they pipe.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.160]   It's impossible.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.920]   I tried once.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.640]   I sat down with Omni-Graphill.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.240]   And I started--
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.720]   And there's so many loops and infinite circles and--
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.960]   Oh, it was terrible.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.560]   It was terrible.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.200]   All your fans do it.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.480]   Kind of go through all your sites
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.280]   and figure out what's posted for--
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.560]   Who posts to what?
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.280]   Then Google Docs is a good drawing tool.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.640]   You don't even need Omni-Graphill.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   See if you can--
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.600]   Yeah, you really just draw it.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.520]   Do you ever have that problem, Pete, with just like,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.840]   you've got too many presences online?
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.280]   You know what?
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.080]   I just go to the manually and do it in that way.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.360]   I remember Scoble did that for a while.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.280]   He'd like link them all up.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.080]   And he'd end up with Jupes coming through when it went
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.560]   through one system and into another.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   He makes some enemies real fast that way.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.680]   It's kind of like-- it's kind of slightly annoying.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.920]   And really-- I don't know.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.960]   The bigger ones are really Facebook and Twitter for us.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.360]   So we just-- from Ashable at least,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.760]   we just focus on manually updating all those things.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.040]   Oh, wait.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.760]   You're huge on Buzz.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.680]   You're the number one.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.280]   Subscribe to Feed on Buzz.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.400]   He's huge.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.120]   We use Buzz still.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.200]   It's not top of mind for us.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.920]   I don't think of this the current time, I think.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.680]   Well, that's telling.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.040]   It's a little bit of sheen.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.840]   We're getting a lot less engagement.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.560]   It kind of drops after the initial hype.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.480]   So for us, Facebook's a big growth place for us.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.640]   It might be-- to be honest, it might be--
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.800]   I was following you on Buzz.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.440]   And what was happening is it basically
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.000]   was a feat of Mashable.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.360]   And I already get Mashable in my RSS reader.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.520]   So I actually unfollowed you because it wasn't about--
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.720]   Well, we've turned a lot of those as we ask questions.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.240]   So we kind of engage--
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   I love that.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.480]   --the audience around it.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.840]   One of the problems when we do that on Buzz
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.880]   is it completely floods everyone's--
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.400]   Exactly.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.240]   --beats with the replies.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.040]   So it's kind of a catch-22 for us with Buzz.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.120]   But we're definitely trying to do that engagement piece
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.920]   where we ask questions.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.840]   It works really well for us on Facebook
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.640]   when we don't just kind of update with headlines.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   Because we're doing it manually anyway.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   So it's not like it's actually a feat going in.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.160]   So we can do whatever we want with those.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.880]   That's an interesting-- yeah, that was actually probably
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.520]   what happened to me following Buzz.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.800]   Was not so much--
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.680]   a following Mashable on Buzz was not so much the number
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.320]   of posts but the engagement.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.720]   Are you still using it actively, though?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.520]   Are you like reading up on--
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.680]   In fact, I don't tweet anymore.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.240]   I buzz and then use Buzz to tweet to tweet.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.040]   Did you get rid of your Facebook account ever?
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.680]   Facebook's dead to me.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.600]   OK.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.640]   And really, literally, it's dead to me.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.800]   I'm going to Foo Camp this weekend.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.480]   And Dave Ricordin's going to be there.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   I think Dave Morin.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   And I don't know if I will be shunned.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.840]   But I would love to engage in a dialogue.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.240]   The thing that put me over the top--
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.200]   I was talking about this on net at night on Tuesday.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.320]   But they just did one thing that really pissed me off,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.720]   which was take all my interests and make me join groups
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.480]   with those interests.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.800]   I just-- public groups.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.720]   I thought that was-- just--
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.960]   and there was no way out of it.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   I thought that was unforgivable.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.440]   It was like--
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.560]   We had the option to delete them all later.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.320]   Yeah, later, I could go back and delete them, right?
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.600]   But for a moment, they'd be public.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.440]   No, I think the choice was basically,
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.160]   we'll delete them, or you can make them public,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.120]   and those are your choices.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.680]   And that was kind of a string of issues
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.400]   they had around that privacy stuff.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:56.680]   I don't know.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   You think I'm crazy?
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.640]   I know I think from--
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.000]   you got to do what you want to do.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.120]   I think you're definitely--
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.880]   Facebook is really a big opportunity for you personally
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.560]   and for Twit.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.640]   And it's your call if you think they've
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   got some kind of ethical issue that's completely up to you.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.360]   You're saying this is very valuable to you.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.560]   See, there's two prongs to this.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.640]   For me, there's the personal disconnect
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.120]   that I really feel blackmailed with,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.960]   because there is nothing to replace Facebook.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.280]   So all those people who were connecting with me socially,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.040]   my old girlfriends, old friends, and stuff,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.120]   I had a disconnect from.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.080]   So that was one.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.040]   That was painful.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.280]   And you're absolutely right from a business point of view.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.120]   Although, it's my opinion, that's less detrimental,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.640]   because there are lots of other ways
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.320]   we engage with our audience besides Facebook.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.040]   So I feel like we can put ourselves out there.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.000]   And frankly, I don't want to appeal to Facebook users.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.320]   It's like, to me, it's like--
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.200]   Facebook users is everybody now, though.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.360]   Yeah, well, too bad.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.920]   It's like AOL.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   I don't want to appeal to everybody.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   Well, yeah, your audience, Leo, is pretty savvy.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.840]   And I mean, they're more likely to be on Twitter or Buzz,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.320]   or on the blog, or an IRC, for example, than Facebook.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.920]   So I think it's probably less of a lost opportunity for a twit.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.640]   But for a Mashable, it seems like a no brain.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.320]   There's no way.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.760]   I mean, that Mashable couldn't be on Facebook.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.880]   I think it's important that there's
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.600]   someone in the tech community who did what you did
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.040]   and kind of made a point of it, and it's
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.280]   going to have a conversation.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   No, I think that's good.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.960]   And you know, Google Camp is at one of those kind of contacts
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.400]   where you can have kind of an off-the-record, frank discussion,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.920]   you know, only me.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.440]   And I'd be interested to know how that goes.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.120]   I'll have to tell you off the record.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.240]   Well, yeah, that's true.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.600]   I was supposed to say, is it ever off the record with you, Leo?
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   I don't know.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.440]   No.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.520]   No.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.120]   Are you going to bring your broadcasting stick to--
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.600]   The first time I got invited to Food Camp a couple of years
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.120]   ago, I said, great, can I bring my microphone?
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.720]   And they said, what?
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.240]   No.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.280]   And they uninvited me.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.120]   And then the second time I didn't respond fast enough.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   So this time I said, because I work weekends.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.160]   I have a job.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.680]   So I'm going to have to take the radio show off.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.320]   And it's a big deal.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.240]   But I really wanted to go partly because I did want to engage
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.680]   with these guys.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.640]   Do you think that Facebook's benign?
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.720]   And then you just got kind of caught in the crossfire.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.360]   They misunderstood what they were doing.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   Or--
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:16.860]   Me?
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   I think Facebook does what's in Facebook's business interests.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.520]   And occasionally, that's not necessarily
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.360]   in the interests of the user.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.240]   That seems pretty obvious.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.320]   And I think they maybe did cross a line, particularly
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.880]   with that privacy update they did like end of last year,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.120]   where it was that dialogue box that kind of popped up
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.800]   and was like, hey, we're about to settle your stuff
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.280]   to public.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.520]   You do this.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.520]   Which is a little bit kind of pushing it.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.080]   But I think they'll--
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.560]   I really think the mainstream users don't necessarily
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.960]   either understand or mind too much the stats
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.880]   that they're showing in terms of growth.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.200]   They didn't really experience it down.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.920]   No, obviously not.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.040]   And that's exactly why I don't feel like it's
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.120]   good for me to promote it.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.200]   Because I have a lot of--
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.560]   believe it or not, because of the radio show,
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.800]   I have a huge number of--
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.480]   over a million listeners of the radio show every week
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.240]   who are not geeks or lesser geeks.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.880]   And I don't feel like it's right to encourage them.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.960]   I was more concerned about them.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.600]   People like you and me and the listeners of this show,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.240]   they know better.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.200]   They know how to use Facebook without getting in trouble.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.000]   I'm not worried about them.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.760]   Oh, anyway, I had it.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.280]   Enough.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.640]   I think we should talk about Google.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.680]   Let's talk about Google.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.760]   Yeah, let's talk about Google.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.960]   So it looks like Google's won its case against Viacom.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.200]   This just came out 23 minutes ago.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.440]   This is from the official Google blog.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.280]   Today, the court granted our motion for summary judgment
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.960]   in Viacom's lawsuit with YouTube.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.680]   That means the court has decided that YouTube is protected.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.000]   This is such good news, not just for Google, but in general,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.240]   that YouTube is protected by the safe harbor of the DMCA
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.040]   against claims of copyright infringement.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.680]   It validates the safe harbor rule, which is critical.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.200]   The choice, really, of the court was to treat YouTube
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.720]   as a common carrier or as a publisher.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.120]   And if they're a publisher, if they're
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.400]   responsible for the content on YouTube, that's a problem.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.280]   With 24 hours of video uploaded every minute,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.280]   there are not enough people in the world to vet all this content.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:18.960]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.000]   That's huge.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.880]   Really important.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.320]   Peter, you must have known about this because your fingers
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.560]   on the pulse.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.440]   Yeah, I think that's awesome news, actually.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.480]   I was kind of surprised that it did resolve in that way.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.480]   Obviously, everyone was on the side of YouTube there.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.840]   But it was kind of-- I don't know.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.400]   Sometimes these court battles seem
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.160]   to go the wrong way just because of lack
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.760]   of understanding about the new technologies.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.560]   We saw it in Europe, and I don't know if that was resolved.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.880]   Do you remember the Italian situation where there was a video--
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.520]   Three YouTube executives are going to go to jail,
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.400]   as far as I can tell.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.440]   If they go to Europe, yeah, go to Italy.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.800]   So I don't know.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.160]   Sometimes they're a bit backward, but I'm glad that at least
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.640]   the US is seeing the light on that one.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.320]   YouTube says-- actually, it's Kent Walker,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.880]   Vice President and General Counsel of Google.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.440]   This is an important victory, not just for us,
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.000]   but for the billions of people around the world who
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.600]   use the web to communicate and share experiences with each other.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.200]   This is the kind of rhetoric I often hear from companies.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.600]   Our victory is your victory.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.840]   But in this case, I think it's kind of true.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.760]   We're excited about this decision and look forward
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.280]   to renewing our focus on supporting
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.760]   the incredible varieties of idea and expression.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.840]   Billions of people post and watch on YouTube
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.360]   every day around the world.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.160]   And this is one case.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.400]   You know, they might actually be true.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.800]   Now, there's an ongoing court case,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.000]   which is getting worse for Google.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.160]   And this is the Street View issue,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   the collection of data from unencrypted Wi-Fi hotspots.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.880]   It started in Germany, the EU's upset.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.800]   And now the state attorney general in Connecticut
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.600]   says we're investigating.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.240]   And he hopes that 30 other state attorneys general
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.320]   will participate in this.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.800]   This is getting worse for Google.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   There's no way Google loses this case.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.000]   This one's pretty straightforward.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.040]   Because there's clearly no intent to use this stuff.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.080]   It was the default setting on Kismet, the software
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.600]   that they were using.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.200]   There's no valuable information.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.400]   And most importantly, there's no demonstrable damage
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.440]   to the people who are suing.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.480]   And you can't sue unless there's damage.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.760]   But it sure is a blow to Google in the court of public opinion.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.040]   I think--
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.080]   Go ahead, Andrea.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.640]   I was going to say, what law did they break?
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.600]   Have they figured out what law they were--
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.960]   Maybe that's what they're looking for.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.000]   What is the-- besides, what did they
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.160]   say violating a reasonable expectation of privacy?
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.400]   I mean, there wasn't any demonstrable damage.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.800]   Was it France that the government who
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.960]   started looking through the data and found that they
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.600]   found some passwords that had been transmitted?
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.280]   That's right.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.240]   Sometimes people transmit passwords over their wireless
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.280]   network when they log in.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.760]   Stupidly.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.640]   And they flipped out about that.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.280]   But Google wasn't collecting passwords.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.600]   And it was fragments of usernames and passwords.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.760]   And as the street view cars rolled by, I don't know.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.560]   This seems like such a weird thing for people.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   There's no law.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   I just want someone to say they broke this law.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.800]   This is how they did it.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.400]   And no one's been able to say that yet.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.880]   But everyone's getting all up in arms.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.800]   And we're going to keep investigating.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.600]   So it's interesting to see what they come up with.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.480]   We talked-- we always talk about this with Jeff,
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.840]   because this is what his new book of public parts is about.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.160]   And he's kind of up on what's going on in Germany
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.920]   and how the Germans feel about all of this.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.800]   I got an email from somebody who said,
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.200]   you often act as if it's the Germans who don't like this.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.360]   He says, it's a few German legislators, court people.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.600]   A lot of us listen to this week in Google in Germany.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.160]   And believe me, we don't have a problem with street view.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.560]   It's government that has a problem with street view.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.600]   So enough of that.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.000]   I think that they will see victory.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   But it sure is.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.360]   I think people who don't know better
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.280]   are seeing this as another example of Google violating
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.800]   their primacy.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.640]   We're going to take a break.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.360]   We've got Pete Cashmore from Mashable with us, Gina Trapani
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.480]   from smarterware.org.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.560]   We're talking about Google and the cloud.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.080]   Before we go too much farther, though,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.560]   I want to talk about a great way to do meetings in the cloud.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.640]   Online meetings with go to meeting.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.000]   Go to meeting is a fantastic product from Citrix.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.040]   It is simply put the easiest way to meet online.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.560]   Now, I can understand a lot of people
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.880]   believe that the best way to meet is in person.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.800]   And I understand that.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.600]   But believe me, you can't always meet in person,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.320]   especially nowadays where we're doing business
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.960]   all over the world.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.600]   Go to meeting can take a conference call,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.960]   which is kind of a necessary evil,
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.040]   and make it something visual engaging,
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.120]   as powerful as meeting in person.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.920]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.280]   That's a $49 value.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.040]   With it, you will get unlimited meetings,
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.280]   as many meetings as you want, as often as you want.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.720]   Plus, absolutely free teleconferencing
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.040]   through VoIP or phone.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.400]   And I use it on my iPad.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.240]   It's so cool.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   There's a free iPad app.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   Here's how easy it is.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.480]   You're going to go to meeting.com right now.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.400]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.440]   You'll have the software installed in 30 seconds.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.400]   It's just a little tiny Java program.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.840]   And now, the next time you want to have a meeting,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   it integrates with Outlook and so forth.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.600]   So you can send an invitation very easily through the mail.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.800]   Or even while you're on the phone in a conference call,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.680]   you can say, "I'd like to show you this."
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.400]   And give them the meeting ID, a little nine-digit number.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.560]   They just go to the website and enter that ID.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.080]   And suddenly, 30 seconds later,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.520]   they're seeing your screen on their computer.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.920]   Not only that, they can flip it around and show you
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.280]   their screen on your computer.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.280]   So it's great for training, collaborating as well as sales.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   128-bit SSL encrypted end-to-end.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.640]   So Google Street View will not see your meeting.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.280]   You're completely safe.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.680]   I love GoToMeeting.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   We use it all the time.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   I know you will too.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   Try it free.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   Do me a favor.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.480]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.080]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.680]   So Dell announced this.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.520]   Well, you know what?
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.440]   The best thing is,
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   Dell announced this.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Well, you know what?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.440]   The big story, we should talk about the big story.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   We should talk about the big story.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   Do you know what it is?
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   Droid X, right?
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   Oh, I was going to say voice.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   But okay.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   Okay, voice is a big story too.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   Okay, we'll do Droid X, then we'll do voice.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   Okay, let's do this.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   Those are both, you know what?
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   Huge.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   I buried the lead again.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   Damn.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:26.600]   So the Motorola Droid X, the announcement was today.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.920]   And they say July 15th, it'll be available $200.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.600]   It's just like every other smart phone.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.120]   It is a big phone.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.880]   It is a 4.3 inch screen.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.360]   Kind of reminds me of the EVO a little bit.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:48.040]   Although it's bigger, I think than the EVO, it will support VCAST, which is Verizon's
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:56.280]   video service, has HDMI out, DLNA compatibility.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.600]   It may be just a little too big.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.520]   You said, Gina, about the EVO that it was as big as you could get and not be uncomfortable.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.920]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.920]   It's bigger than the EVO.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   Hmm.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   Same size screen.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:12.120]   I think, I think Pogues had in his EVO video, like it's just like having a baby iPad to
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   your head.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.200]   And it does kind of come close to that.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.240]   So if it's bigger than that, what it looks like it's 4.3 inches.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   Isn't that what the EVO is?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.760]   I mean, that's the EVO screen, but I think physically the handset is bigger.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.920]   Once with this trend of all the Android phones suddenly getting bigger and bigger and bigger,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.040]   it's just not like, is it something that's any demand for?
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.480]   I feel like I much prefer iPhones, right?
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.520]   I'm just increasing the resolution of the screen.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.040]   Well, that's an interesting device, but you get more stuff on the screen.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   That's an interesting choice.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.480]   Now, you're young with good eyes.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.440]   So, for you, more resolution means more real estate.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.360]   It doesn't for me because I can't read tiny print and see little icons, so you have to
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.520]   make the stuff bigger anyway.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.160]   I think it's kind of an obvious selling point.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.760]   You know, I think you can walk into a store and they can say, "Hey, this phone's bigger
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.760]   than the iPad."
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.200]   And that's, yeah, you're kind of normal consumer.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.040]   We'll be like, "I like the EVO."
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.640]   The EVO resolution is the same as the old iPad.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.080]   It's not bigger resolution, it's just bigger screen.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.560]   I think it maybe is a response to the iPad, right?
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's kind of like an iPad nano.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.240]   I don't know, what do you think, Peter?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.880]   You're an iPhone guy, right?
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.120]   I'm actually, my main phone is still in excess one right now.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.880]   I will be switching probably to a four iPhone 4 next week when mine comes.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.280]   But I think both are phenomenal operating systems.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.440]   I think it's really great for the consumers that we're having that choice.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.720]   But honestly, I think Android is going to be the bigger in terms of pure numbers.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.640]   I think they will eventually overtake the iPhone.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.880]   Some numbers say they already have.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.280]   It's kind of debatable, but they're certainly selling it at a fast rate.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.080]   So, I know, I'm kind of, here's where I don't like about Android and iPhone is that people
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.600]   kind of treat it like religions.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.440]   And when we write about iPhone, we get all these people being like, "Oh, my goodness,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.240]   you're on the Apple side."
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.440]   Or we write about Android and they say, "You're on Google's side."
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.480]   And I think, you know, I'm kind of on both sides because I think they're both kind of
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   moving.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.320]   You kind of sped up the pace of innovation here.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.800]   And at least for now, let's remember that you don't have the choice of an iPhone if you
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.480]   are not willing to get AT&T.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.840]   So I think it's great that Verizon keeps coming up with compelling handsets.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.800]   So now you can use an XS1 and AT...
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.440]   Now you travel to the UK and so forth, so you have to have a GSM phone.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440]   Yes.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.840]   There's just no question about that.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:47.440]   But if you're a US user and you're not going to leave the shores and you want Verizon or
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.640]   Sprint, you've got two very good choices that I think are pretty damn close to an iPhone.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.200]   I haven't used the new iPhone for it.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.560]   Maybe they'll leapfrog, but they're certainly as good as the 3GS.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.760]   You know, I was impressed.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.200]   You told me that HTC was good on returns.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   I got that experience.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.760]   My top switch, I don't know if you've had this problem with your Nexus one, but I got
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.200]   it right when Google came out with it.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.560]   You know, this is the one thing I really don't like about Android is you're always
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.200]   pressing that top switch to wake it up and put it asleep.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.560]   It's not a good switch.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.400]   And it's the same on the Droid, on the EVO, and all of them.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.560]   It's just this little research switch.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.560]   I don't like it.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.000]   And it died eventually.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.680]   And for a while, I thought that my non-responsive Nexus one was software because I'd pressed
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   a switch and then I...
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.280]   But it wouldn't wake up or I'd press a switch and it would wake up, but I couldn't do my
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   pattern to unlock.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.560]   And I thought, "This thing, I wanted to throw it."
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.360]   And then it got to a point where I took out the battery, put it in, and I couldn't turn
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   it on.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360]   So, "Oh, it's the top switch.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.920]   It's not software."
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.680]   Called HTC no hold time.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.280]   Maybe I was lucky, but it was a Monday morning, which is notoriously the worst time for calling
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.920]   support.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.160]   No hold time.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.480]   They said, "Oh, well, what's your IMEI number?"
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.200]   I said, "Oh, I can't turn it on."
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.440]   They said, "Oh, it's in the open and uptake out the battery."
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.840]   "Oh, yeah, there it is."
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   I gave him that number.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   They said, "Oh, hi, Mr. Le...
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   This is Mr. Leport.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.440]   I see yours is engraved.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.200]   Now, if you want to preserve the engraving, you'll need to send us the phone.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.640]   We'll fix it and send it back.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.840]   We'll pay shipping.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.280]   It'll take about seven days."
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   But they said, "They were so nice.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.600]   Do you have a handset to replace it?"
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.000]   I said, "Yeah, I'm using this N900."
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.680]   And they said, "Well, if you want, we can just send you a new phone.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.080]   We'll authorize a charge on your card, and then you ship us back the old phone.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   And as long as the damage is, you know, not out of warranty damage, as long as you didn't
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.800]   flush it down the toilet or something, we'll just make a swamp."
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.200]   And that's what happened to you, Gina, right?
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.200]   Yep, exactly.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   Exactly.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   It was great.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.600]   And the phone is on the FedEx truck.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.600]   It's going to be here today.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   That's pretty phenomenal because you remember when the Nexus One launched, most of the complaints
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.920]   were on Google not having any system for dealing with complaints.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.160]   That was my concern.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   I was really concerned.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   I thought, "Oh, no.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   Who do I go to?
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   I didn't buy this from anybody.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.920]   I bought it from Google.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.880]   I bought it from a Python script.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.000]   How am I going to get this fixed?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.800]   Well, they're Python-powered.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.400]   The customer service people are pretty good."
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.440]   Well, I call Google and they transfer me to HDC pretty quickly.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.680]   I mean, HDC actually took care of me, right?
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   I think that's...
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   No, that's not work.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.960]   In fact, what I did is I Googled Nexus One support or something like that.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.800]   And it came to an HDC page and said, "No, we do that.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   Call that number.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   No, no, hold time.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   I should have done it immediately.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.240]   I was just thinking, "Oh, I don't want to go through this."
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   I know.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   I did the same thing.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.400]   I hung on to my phone with all the dust on the screen for weeks, like things about it.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.320]   And then it took five minutes.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   So kudos.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:43.800]   I know that Google got a lot of heat for support with the Nexus One, but I was very impressed.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.480]   And they're just going to basically swap it.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.720]   Now, is this what happened to you?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.080]   You get to keep your old battery and cover.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.320]   Yeah, I was really surprised by that.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   I have two batteries.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.160]   They said, "Take everything out and right, right."
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.560]   So you just sent back the shell, right?
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   The shell.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.280]   So I lose my engraving, but I gain a battery, which would be great.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.320]   Now, because the only qualm I have about Android phones is battery life.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.240]   How's that Evo doing for you on battery life?
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   Are you led to a friend that's...
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.000]   I led it to a friend, yeah.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.520]   Who fell in love with it and was keeping it.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   That gets me happy.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   No, that's cool.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   Bye-bye.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.880]   You didn't want that anyway.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   All right.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   The other big...
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.440]   So, Droid X, look for it the 15th.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   There are now...
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.480]   I'll get one just to review it, but I would say the Evo is an excellent handset if that
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.760]   battery battery life would be 100% from my point of view.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.080]   Just tip top.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   I love the Nexus 1.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   I'm going to stick with the Nexus 1 because I can put 2.2 on it.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.560]   Although I keep hearing that they haven't pushed 2.2 at all.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.040]   Did you get 2.2 yet?
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.800]   No, and it's point of contention for me.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   That's bizarre.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.440]   I haven't had to go with that.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.120]   There's definitely delay with over the air updates.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.240]   I'm definitely getting emails from listeners and from readers who are saying, "Okay, so
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   when does it come?"
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   Well, I just did the manual update.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   The manual.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   Yeah, I did the manual update.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.280]   I don't even think that zip file is available anymore.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   Oh.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.120]   I don't think it's where it was when we did it.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.880]   I thought maybe I screwed it up with the manual update.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.280]   But of course I didn't.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   It was hardware.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.960]   So, Pete, you're not going to do a manual update.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   You're just going to wait.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.240]   Oh, I might, but I'm probably going to get 4G and then you start learning a lot, but
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   I don't know.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   We'll see.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   The Evo.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   No, the iPhone.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   I'll probably get a 4G and then I'll get a 4G.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Oh, the 4.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   People call it the 4G.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   That's confusing.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   The iPhone 4.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   We thought it was something that HD, you haven't to that, huh?
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   Apple.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.080]   So I don't know if this will change the availability of 2.2 or not, but today Google did open source
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.800]   2.2.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   What does that mean, Gina?
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   You're the developer.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   What does that mean?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.560]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.360]   I mean, I think it just means that they, I think that they work on, I could be wrong
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.960]   with this and so the chat room should correct me.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:07.360]   But I think that they work on the new version, kind of not in public and then they publish
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   the code at a checkpoint.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.880]   Yeah, so like, right.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.240]   So it's done and now it's out there for folks to grab it.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:21.040]   Including OEMs like HTC and Motorola who can now take it and make it their own.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   Exactly.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:28.280]   Speaking of HTC, there's reports today that Apple's suing them again for painting them
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   infringement.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   Right.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.600]   So that's how many times now?
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   I don't even know.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.760]   Well, the old suit's still going too.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.400]   So there's just more, right?
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   Piling on.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400]   Yes.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   Poor little HTC.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.560]   They didn't have the guts to go after Google so they go after HTC.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.960]   Or is it the HTC sense that they're not happy about?
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.600]   Our Technica says in a new lawsuit filed against HTC in several US subsidiaries.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:56.000]   Apple claims HTC's smartphones infringe on four more of its smartphone technology patents.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.280]   It was like the lock screen.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   The slide do unlock thing.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.320]   Apple, just make a better phone.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   That's all.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.480]   It's not hard.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.320]   Don't have to sue.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.520]   So good news, 2.2 open source.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520]   All right.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.680]   Now, Gina, the big story of the day.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.520]   This is the story that made me very happy this week.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.920]   Well, two stories made me very happy, but most people will be really happy about the
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.640]   fact that Google Voice is now open to everyone in the US.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.440]   No invitation required.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   Yeah, US only.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.200]   So you go to google.com/voice.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.160]   You can sign up for a phone number.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.360]   I believe you can pick the area.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.160]   And Google Voice is really awesome.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.320]   And it's been my exclusive, my primary phone number actually, for more than a year.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.240]   And it's literally, if you haven't gotten Google Voice, a lot of people are like, what
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   is it again?
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.000]   Now that it's open and I can use it, what does it do?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.800]   It's basically like, I kind of feel like it's Gmail for your phone calls and your voicemail.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.880]   You get a phone number and it can ring multiple phones.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.040]   You can create rules about who's calling.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.360]   If you set up, say for instance, a business number, you can say ring my phone.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.240]   If the call comes between nine and five, Senate straight to voicemail, if it comes
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.480]   after five before nine, you can have--
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   I love it.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   You can have--
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   Contact groups.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Contact groups.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   You can have--
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   With different voicemail for each.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   If this--
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   If this is voicemail for a caller.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.960]   This throws my wife because after my wife leaves a message, I say, hi, I'm not here, leave
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.600]   a message, love you.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.920]   And she says, do you tell everybody that you love them and your voicemail?
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.920]   She doesn't understand that.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.440]   No, that's just for you, honey.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   So great.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.440]   So great.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.840]   I got stuck on some call or list.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.200]   I was getting all these, not prank calls, but telemarketing calls.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.960]   You can make a list, a blacklist basically.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.960]   They go straight to voicemail.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.120]   You can't go straight voicemail or just don't pick up.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   It's fantastic.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.600]   So it lets you just create rules and it manages multiple phones.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   You can hop between different phones without--
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.360]   It's great for us because if you have multiple phones, as all three of us do, all of them
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.720]   ring or you could just say this one rings or that one rings, it's really nice.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.600]   I don't have to worry about what my actual handset number is anymore.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   You read your voicemail.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   I hate listening to voicemails.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.560]   It's like one of my biggest pet peeves.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.680]   You get a transcript.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.080]   The transcripts are usually laughably off, but they're good enough.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.560]   They seem like they're getting better.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.560]   Have you noticed that?
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.560]   I think they are getting better.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.280]   No doubt in my mind that Google is making its algorithm.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.880]   Then its algorithm is learning as it goes.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.800]   So it's a fantastic product and I'm really glad it's open.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.040]   I'm sorry to everyone outside the US.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.920]   I had a lot of very upset international.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   I know.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.280]   We have almost half of our audience for the show is international and they're gnashing
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   their teeth right now.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   They're so angry at us.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.120]   Yeah, we maybe better not label it at the point.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.680]   And we actually covered it.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.880]   We were like, Google Voice, and they're open to everyone.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.320]   And then instantly had like--
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.320]   Not everybody.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   Not everyone outside the US.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.640]   Well, you want to know better.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.920]   You're in Vancouver right now where it's not available and you make your home in Scotland
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.720]   much of the time where it's not available.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   It's true.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   It's kind of frustrating actually.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   It's one of the things with Google TV coming up.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.600]   We're going to have this a lot of things.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.400]   iPhone release that you kind of have to work around a little bit if you're not in the
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.560]   US most of the time.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.920]   So it's a little bit challenging this international stuff.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.560]   We kind of wish that these companies would consider the rest of the world because it's
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.560]   a big market out there.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.200]   I think it's with phones especially as those challenges of international.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.240]   It's kind of the old systems they're battling against rather than them actually being like
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.960]   referring the US in any way.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.280]   Yeah, I give them a pass on this just because it is phone related on the international issue.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.080]   I'm sure that it's complicated with numbers and prefixes and all those things.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.680]   So yeah, I feel bad for the international folks, but I kind of give Google a pass.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.480]   Normally I would expect.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.560]   Uh oh, we will never know what Gina expects because she's there.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   She unfroze.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.560]   That was good.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   I would expect.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   What?
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   What would you expect?
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.560]   What?
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   What?
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   No, of course it's phones.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   It's not, you know, when you talk about publishing music or phones, all of these things
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   don't respect the borders are like and TV very soon when Google starts getting into
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.400]   that same issue.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.800]   I don't know if I will.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.840]   I don't think, I really don't think you're going to say, oh gosh, I wish I had Google
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.840]   TV.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.840]   I do actually.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.000]   Maybe I'll be based in the US, but then I think, yeah, I want to try everything.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   You know, it kind of changed my attitude.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.840]   I'm kind of like, yeah, I just want to try everything because you never know.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840]   You never know.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   You know, what's the harm in like trying it?
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   Oh, I agree.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.000]   I will certainly try it.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.800]   I just don't think it's going to be, I don't know.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.360]   First of all, I don't even know if it's going to come out.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.840]   You know, they, they have these relationships with Sony and dish and all that, but doesn't
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.520]   mean you're going to see a product.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.320]   And if you do, I don't know if it's going to be, you know, something you really want.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   I don't, I'm skeptical.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.680]   You know, I really think the TV is the next screen for this whole app platform to come
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   soon.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.440]   I think if Google doesn't do it, Apple will do it.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   Well, I agree with that.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.840]   Deep jobs was kind of, he kind of overdid his denial.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.400]   I remember it was a deep prince.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.640]   He was like, no, TV will never work and listed like a bunch of reasons why there's no way
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.320]   that Apple would ever get into TV and that, you know, Apple TV is just a side project and
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   that kind of thing.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   That usually means they're going to do it.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.040]   We have to test a little too much on that one.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.760]   I think we're probably going to get into that next.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.200]   It would be so obvious for them to do so.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   Why not?
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   And they already sell all the stuff and so forth.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   We have the app store.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   So that's just huge.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.240]   I mean, if all the developers could just, you know, record the apps to see that really
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.840]   big screen and why not?
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.600]   And Google did announce last week Google Music.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.400]   So they're already kind of in this space a little bit.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.800]   It would be great for a game.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.520]   I mean, I'm using my iPad and if a game as well.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.320]   So I'm just going to just bump that up to, you know, 14 e-stars.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.400]   I know it's fantastic.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.320]   So they're building out a game club.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.520]   Getting Zynga and all these other social gaming developers getting onto the app store.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.080]   It's one of the most popular app types on the app store.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.560]   So, you know, why not take on the console makers?
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   That reminds me.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.560]   Farmville just came out on the iPhone.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.160]   I'll see you guys later.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.640]   Someone on Twitter tells me that the manual update for the Nexus One, the Froyo was an
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:14.280]   internal build and the official Froyo is not going over the air to then ones just yet.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.760]   So, I probably shouldn't install the Froyo Froyo.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.520]   I just like saying Froyo Froyo.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.560]   Yeah, and if Froyo Froyo, the internal test build.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   Interesting.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.360]   So what's going to happen is my phone can explode when the actual official update goes
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   out.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.240]   Well, this was one of my concerns is that when the update did come out, that it wouldn't
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.440]   update because it's a way you already have it.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   And I would like the final one.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.640]   Of course, cyanogen is already announced now that it's open sourced that they're going
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:52.320]   to do cyanogen mods for Android 2.2 for Nexus One, Desire, the G1.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   Nice.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.320]   Old school.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.520]   Rocket at old school.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.280]   My touch.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.800]   My touch slide.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.920]   Evo, hero, and droid.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.840]   Yes, we, you know, it's like carriers, whatever.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.640]   I want cyanogen to get ahold of the 2.2 code.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.240]   Like that's what I'm skydered about.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.400]   So that's interesting.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.520]   So you wouldn't hesitate to put the cyanogen ROMs on there.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.720]   At this point, cyanogen has earned my trust.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.040]   Like I've used his stuff a few times.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.360]   In fact, we should get him on the show.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   Okay, deal.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.800]   He's probably 12 years old, but do you know Izzy?
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   I mean, he probably is, right?
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   He's probably.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   I don't think so.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.920]   Yeah, when I got my first G1, okay, I hacked it.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.720]   And it was cool.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.080]   This is going to work great for getting one to show later.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.360]   You can't say this is really going to want him to come on.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.080]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.400]   I love you, cyanogen.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   You rock.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.680]   I think he's like in his 20s, as I remember.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.760]   I just like to make fun of people under 50, which means all of you.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.160]   So anyway, so what would you do, Gina?
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.960]   Because cyanogen cannot distribute the Google Apps.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.400]   Yeah, but he's figured that out.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   I think that he's figured this out, right?
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   I think actually he worked with Google on this.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.440]   Oh, so they like there's a tar ball or something.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.680]   Yeah, there's a way that you can kind of like back up the apps that you have, install
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:29.520]   his ROM and then read, you know, so I believe that he was able to navigate the distribution
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   issues.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   Well, I'll do it if you will.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.520]   Let's do it.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   Okay, we're going to do it.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   All right.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   Will you do it to Pete?
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.160]   Yeah, I'll do that.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   Oh, man.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   Pete, you're getting corrupted.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.640]   He's like, I don't care.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   That was my Android phone.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   I'm going to have my iPhone.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   He doesn't care.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.800]   Does he maybe I'll wait till July 15th when my end my four comes.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.200]   Oh, no, I know.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   I want to know.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.320]   Now, is this this you have to root it to do this, right?
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   Yes.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.880]   Well, I mean, speaking of which that kind of relates to the whole like, okay, Android's
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.520]   more open deal, but there's reports this week and I don't know if they've kind of
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.840]   been I think they were kind of I think this is a little bit.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.560]   But there was reports that maybe up to 20% of Android apps were possibly spyware.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.040]   This comes from S mobile S mobile systems.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.320]   Yeah, they sent us a press release.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.400]   I'm kind of skeptical on it.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:25.320]   I think it's kind of an overestimate, but I think that's something to it where when you
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.040]   have a more open system, you have a lot more opportunity to take advantage.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.080]   Well, that's for sure.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.920]   I mean, we've seen malicious apps in the app store because nobody's vetting them.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   Right.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:43.960]   And I think it's kind of remarkable how this whole how this whole setup is echoing the
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.600]   whole Windows versus Mac set up with Android.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.440]   I mean, that's been said, but even on the spyware side on the exploit side, it would
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.640]   appear that Android is lining up to be the Windows.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   No wonder if that'll eventually cut into their popularity of, you know, people are
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   trying to avoid.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.360]   I have to take advantage of it.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   You want secure.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.320]   I think it's probably you could make a good case that something like the iPad, which is
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.560]   completely locked down or the iPhone.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   I don't know.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   There's some kind of Safari issue.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   It hasn't been updated.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.120]   Oh, this is a big issue.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   Yeah, because Apple pushed out updates for its all of its platforms with iOS for except
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.360]   the iPad.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.720]   And in that push, there were 65 vulnerabilities that I think half of them were critical.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:31.040]   So you've got 30 plus critical vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which allow for remote code
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.160]   execution, which is as bad as it gets.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.760]   Unpatched on the iPad now.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   Right.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.640]   We just kind of came to argument that closed systems are just as vulnerable to whoever's
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.080]   managing the system, making a mistake and not noticing.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.840]   So it's that, you know, half dozen to one, six to the other.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:52.920]   So Gina, it's my understanding that when you root a phone that normally you unlock the
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   bootloader.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   Yes.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.880]   And this is a bad thing because then they can tell you messed with your phone or what?
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.000]   Oh, who can tell?
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Like their, your caries?
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   The Google police.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And the Google police.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.320]   Somebody's saying it's going to avoid your warranty.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.880]   But if you don't mess with the bootloader, it doesn't avoid your warranty.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.480]   And apparently there's a way to do the rooting without messing with the bootloader.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   Oh, really?
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   It's been a while.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.000]   I rooted my G1 back in the back in the day and then I was like, I want to have the full,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.640]   I haven't rooted my my Nexus one.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.480]   So I'm not, I'm not, I'm actually not sure.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.960]   I mean, the reality is you can reset it.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.000]   I, from what I understand, you can set it to factory.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.800]   Without a full erase or something.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.280]   This, this report about spyware.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.080]   I don't, I mean, it could be considered malicious or suspicious.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.920]   This is like saying, I mean, anything could be anything.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   It's based on permissions.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   So,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.280]   It's based on permissions and other attributes.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.720]   So like, I don't, I mean, just because something listens to your key presses doesn't
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   mean it's a key logger.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.520]   I mean, there's, there's, I don't know.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.120]   I could just say though, those screens do freak you out a little bit when you first
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   get an Android phone.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.400]   It says, Hey, this app wants to be able to make phone calls and I like it.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.760]   I like it because unlike Apple, they tell you, in fact, Apple, this is even what Apple
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.640]   says, Steve Jobs said this at the de-conference about privacy.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.720]   You tell them, you tell them again, then you tell them again.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.920]   I think it's good to give people information.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.920]   You're right.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.840]   It's a little scary for somebody who doesn't want to.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.520]   But it's better to have the information than just say, okay, no problem.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.120]   I agree with you, Leo, but I've become sort of desensitized to it now.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.320]   Like, I've installed so many apps.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.160]   And the other thing is that when the app tells you, I need network access.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   I need this.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   I need that.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   It doesn't explain why.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.880]   So I find myself asking like, what, what does this app do?
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   Okay.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.520]   You know, that, that makes me, and can I, can I opt out of that feature?
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.240]   You know, I wish it was just a little more informative.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240]   I don't know.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   Some people would argue that maybe it's a little too much information.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.360]   But I, but I wish I could say like, oh, I know that this app does this thing and this
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.960]   is why it needs access to my network.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.000]   This is why it may pull data.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.280]   So I think it could be refined a little bit so that you can make a more informed decision
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.320]   because right now it's either yes or no, right?
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   And now I just tap.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   I mean, I just, what do you say?
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.320]   No, you download it.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.320]   You want it.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   Right.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   Exactly.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   Exactly.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.120]   So that information is meaningless because you're going to say yes, no matter what it
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   says.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:23.040]   It's like, it's like the, I got Apple pushed a 45 page updated terms of service for iTunes
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.840]   9.2 45 pages.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.840]   You're looking at it on your iPhone.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.320]   It says, that's worse than Facebook.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.560]   It says, would you like to read this or just accept it?
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.160]   And it's, well, I'm going to sit here read 45 pages on my iPhone.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   What do you.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   Right.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.160]   It's ridiculous.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.760]   But like check to see whether or not you scroll down to the end.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   That's funny.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   So what do you do?
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   All right.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   I read it all.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.640]   We're going to take a break and come back with more and lots more to talk about.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.360]   I'm so glad Pete Cashmore is here from Mashable.com.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.160]   Gina Tripani from smarter where.org.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.040]   Again, if you just tuned in, Jeff Jarvis is in air, mid air.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   He was flying to Chicago.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   He's speaking in Chicago tonight.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.720]   We had hope to get him on, but he was stuck as always.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.880]   Chicago is a tough airport.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.440]   In the winter, it's snow.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.840]   In the summer, it's thunderstorms.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.440]   You can't win.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.720]   You can't win.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   So Jeff's not with us.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.800]   He'll be back next week.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.720]   Meanwhile, I would like to tell you about backup.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.920]   You know, this is so important.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.520]   One of the things I really love about the Nexus one and the Android operating system,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.440]   when I get that new handset, I log into my Google account and boom.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   Wow.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   Wow.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   All this stuff is immediately restored.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.240]   I, you know, I don't have to worry about backup on an Android.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.200]   I wish all devices were like that.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.680]   If you're using a Mac or Windows, you know, you're responsible for backing up.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.160]   And if you're going to backup, you got to do it right automatically because nobody
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   remembers.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   Don't fool.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.000]   Don't be one of those people says, oh, yeah, I'll back up every week.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.240]   Look, I got this great external drive.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.640]   I'll do that three months later.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.400]   Your hard drive dies and you go, oh, I forgot.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.400]   Should be automatic.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.080]   And by the way, you find a backup to an external drive, but that's not the end of it because
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:07.040]   what if, you know, there's a fire or a flutter, you're living in the Portola Valley and there's
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.640]   an earthquake and boom.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   It loves it all.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.040]   You got to backup offsite.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   Carbonite does that to 128 bit encryption SSL backs it right up to the cloud.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.840]   You can use AES 256 to encrypt it before it's sent.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.480]   And only you have the password to that.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.360]   So you really have privacy.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.520]   I'm going to do this on my daughter's.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.080]   She's taking a Mac book to college.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.880]   You bet carbonite's going on it so that I don't get that call middle of the night.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.360]   I lost my paper.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.880]   I lost my notebook.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.120]   I lost my hard drive.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.160]   It's always backed up anywhere you can get online.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.680]   You can get that data back.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.400]   And there's even an iPhone app.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.000]   Try it free 15 days.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.360]   No credit card needed.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.760]   Carbonite.com offer code twig twig.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:51.080]   And if you decide to buy two months free when you use twig as the offer code carbonite.com,
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.640]   you got to back it up to get it back.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.480]   So do it right with carbonite.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.760]   Good news from Twitter.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.080]   Several people say that those of us who manually installed the Nexus one update to two will
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.320]   get the over the air update because it is a different bill number.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.640]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.840]   So I think I kept that zip file.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.840]   So I should be able to.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   I'm sure I kept it.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.200]   Yeah, I mean, well, you won't even you won't eat it because you'll get the over there
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.720]   update and I'll be the official bill.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.600]   And I'm also told that you can get a get around unlocking the bootloader on the end
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.160]   one when you can be flat.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.160]   Which is amazing.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   I know Twitter is amazing.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.160]   It is amazing.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.400]   All we have to do is say one thing wrong or ask a question and boom.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.760]   I know it's fantastic.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   There are even a few people urging cyanogen on Twitter to accept when we ask them to
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   make a comment.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   They don't mention the thing the little 12 year old and snark.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.160]   Hopefully they won't say anything about that.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.280]   Man, Leo was so snarky about you.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.880]   You ought to come on and set him straight.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.960]   He probably could beat my ass.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.920]   Okay.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.200]   Moving along.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.520]   Microsoft going after Google apps with a switchers campaign.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.160]   We were talking before the show started Pete and I.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.880]   He said, you know, you're smart to do a Google show because Google's taken off.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.880]   Yep.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   It's Google.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.880]   These days is Google Facebook Apple.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.680]   I said, what about Microsoft?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   What did you say Pete?
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.040]   Yeah, so Microsoft's kind of out of the game right now in terms of mobile OS at least.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.760]   They've got a new Xbox 360.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   That's it.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.080]   They got connect big deal.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.240]   They are the last big thing they did that actually got some coverage and looks pretty
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   innovative.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.520]   They do have not going anyway.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.080]   They do have the kin Leo.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.080]   You're going to get a kin.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.200]   No, I thought the kid was kind of cute.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.160]   If I wanted five phones, I guess I'd get a kin.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.680]   It would be the fifth though, right?
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:48.080]   Because you want the Evo, the Nexus one, the iPhone four, the Droid X, maybe then a kin.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.840]   Word OS does the kin run anyway.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.960]   It's it's it's kind of like software's kind of walking.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   It's bit twisted in between.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.640]   It's not Windows phone seven yet.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.560]   It's using the zoom interface.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.240]   You know, this really because it wasn't a moment that was like, oh, Google has so many
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.040]   operating systems like kind of track.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.120]   That was called talking about the pot calling the cliddle black.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.920]   Mike said, no, what kin was running.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.320]   It's not six five.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.320]   It's not seven.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.520]   It's six point seven five, I guess.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.560]   Anyway, the kin looks pretty cool.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.480]   I like the idea of social on a phone.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.960]   I think it's aimed at, you know, people your age, not my age, but so Microsoft does have
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   it.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.240]   I don't think that they've done a very good job marketing it a fairly credible cloud solution.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.040]   Office for the web looks great.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   In Office 2010, right?
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.000]   Just got released kind of a big deal and it talks to it.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.640]   You know, you can save files to the web, right?
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:42.240]   It got SharePoint, which a lot of big businesses use instead of Google Docs.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   That's the thing.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.920]   I think there are a lot of people in big business and corporate situations are really
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.000]   excited about Office 2010 and Windows seven and kind of the new thing, those new things.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.640]   I think that we just we don't, you know, because we're kind of freelancers or small
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.720]   business people, we don't we don't use those things.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.200]   But Office 2010 is pretty cool.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   I hear.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   And it's kind of nice.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.880]   It has like live typing kind of like wave collaborative typing.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:07.800]   You could set up SharePoint at your own SharePoint installation and collaborate that way.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.360]   So, you know, that's that's something we're working on an enterprise show because I know
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360]   we need to cover this.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:21.200]   We do cover it a little bit on Windows weekly and but have you ever heard of BPOS anybody?
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.200]   Bueller?
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.880]   No, this is what it is.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.240]   This is what Microsoft's pushing business productivity online standard suite.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   No name, isn't it?
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240]   B-P-O-S.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.080]   This Google or Bing BPOS.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.880]   This is what Microsoft wants you to use instead of Google Docs.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:44.440]   And I again, I presume I would hope if you are in, oh, look, they want to chat with me.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   No, no, I don't think so.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   Welcome to Microsoft.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   I can assist you with your questions.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.160]   I think Clippy is in BPOS.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.560]   Would you like to make a list?
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.560]   No.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.040]   It looks like you're trying to switch away from Google.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   It looks like you're trying to switch from Google.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.960]   BPOS is a set of messaging and collaboration solutions hosted by Microsoft.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.400]   It consists of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live, Meeting and Office Communications
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.640]   Online.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.920]   Maybe this is the kind of marketing that works in enterprise.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.280]   Maybe that's all I can think of.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.000]   Well, it's super safe, isn't it?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.280]   So it's safe to continue on with Microsoft products.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.360]   I think it's a battle they need to win because right now what is Microsoft?
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.400]   It's the OS and it's Office.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:33.280]   And they're definitely got no play in the future of the OS, which is mobile.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.640]   It's going to be Android versus the iOS.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.880]   So Microsoft really needs to fight that battle against Google on the whole Office space thing,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.360]   or they're going to lose every battle that matters to them.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.200]   And they need better marketing than a switcher campaign, to be honest with you.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.400]   But that's what they're doing.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.720]   Honestly, I think that product is more of a problem than marketing right now.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:57.480]   I mean, if you look at Bing, really hard marketing drive on that one, they're spending a lot
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   of marketing.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.120]   Do you like those Bing ads, those TV ads?
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.760]   I find them very bizarre and upsetting.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.480]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.840]   Bing is a sponsor.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.840]   I think...
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   Oh, we love Bing.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   God bless Bing.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:15.080]   I think he probably is on some level as well, you know.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   But...
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.040]   Yeah, you don't have to moderate your opinion because they're a sponsor.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   That's not...
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.600]   No, I think...
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   I certainly wouldn't.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.320]   I think Bing has done better than most people expected it to do.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.680]   If you'd said a few years ago, Microsoft's going to make a real play and get a few percentage
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.080]   points of the search market, they haven't really taken it off Google, though they've
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.000]   been taking it off other people.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.960]   Tell me what this is an ad for.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.560]   Just watch this or listen to this ad.
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.960]   Tell me what this is an ad for.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.480]   Oh, it's a private video.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   Oh, please.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   Or ads private.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   Never mind.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   That's innovation, right there.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   Let me see if this other one is a private.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:55.080]   Hey, Dad, did you pick me at a cell phone?
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.160]   Cell walls are thicker than plasma membranes and were originally discovered by Robert
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.520]   Hook and a sample of cork.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.520]   Okay.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.880]   So, I guess that means you didn't find me a phone.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.720]   Thousands of telephone poles are destroyed each year by woodpeckers.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.120]   Woodpeckers also nest in the cavities of cheese.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.120]   Do you not find this disturbing?
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.120]   We're a celebrity mom.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   Has another one on the way?
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.120]   What?
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   Sucker mom.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   Mom, geez.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.760]   Mom, so we're jeans to match their teens jeans.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.080]   I hate these ads.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.560]   They scare the hell out of me.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.520]   They're like the stepford wives.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.520]   The search overload.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.720]   Yeah, the premise is that, and it's by the way, not at all obvious, typical bad Microsoft
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:32.600]   marketing, the premise is that these people are responding with what they would have gotten
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.280]   had they searched for those terms.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.640]   But you can't tell.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.360]   It just seems like they're cracked.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.560]   Here's another one here.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.880]   Hey, did you ever find takers to Hawaii?
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.880]   Hawaii Five O.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.920]   Bookum Dano Aloha, Melei Kaliki Maka, Surflingo, Bra.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.480]   I was stoked when I caught that tasty barrel.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   Seriously.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.480]   Did you price out tickets?
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.640]   I thought it'd be the traffic ticket.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   Ten proven methods.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.880]   Traffic courts don't want you to know.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   What are you talking about?
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   Talk Turkey.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.080]   Talk live with hot singles in your area.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   They're waiting.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.080]   Who's waiting?
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.840]   See, I guess that's you on the Bing.com.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.520]   But we love Bing because they are a sponsor of Mashable Black.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   They do.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   They sponsor a lot of cool things.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.520]   They say I see that they sponsor the suit, which is one of my favorite, like it's a,
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.520]   you know, cable clip show.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.520]   Love the suit.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.520]   Love the suit.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.800]   So whenever I see the Bing ad.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.800]   I don't know.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   I might be just me because the chatroom saying love these ads.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   They're great.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   They're wonderful.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   Ah.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   They're trying something a little bit different.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.960]   They're trying something a little bit unusual.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:39.920]   So I was ripping them because of BPOS, which by the way, could you pick a worse acronym?
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.080]   It's wrong on two levels.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.720]   First of all, it could be the British Petroleum operating system.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.680]   Bad or it could be a big POS.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   Bad.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:56.120]   There's no, there's no good interpretation of BPOS.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.000]   But you know, that's fine.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.560]   They're not known for great marketing.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.320]   And that's just the way I think it is.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.320]   Microsoft.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.960]   Well, I don't know their PC campaign did pretty well.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   Did you like that?
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   The numbers.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   Well, they were according to the numbers.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:14.520]   And it was kind of a reaction to the whole Mac ads with the whole switch campaign.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   They did need to respond.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   They did need to respond to that.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   All right.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.520]   I'm not going to go for it.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.520]   But it did well.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   I mean, in terms of, I think it was like price perception.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.840]   Young people were perceiving that's well, PCs to be more affordable and better value
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.840]   for money.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.840]   You know, we discussed that.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.840]   It worked.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.840]   Yeah, it worked.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   So it worked for them.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   Okay.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   All right.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   Sometimes it works.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   Let's see here of Google Maps, mania.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.080]   I love this real time London tube map.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.320]   This is a really interesting.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.960]   That's so cool.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.640]   People should check that out if they haven't already.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.800]   So I don't know how you do this.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:47.000]   This is using Google Maps, but this actually shows where the trains are in the London underground
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.640]   in real time.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   So it's awesome.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   I guess you could fire this up on your phone and see how soon before the train arrived.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.280]   My God, it was for New York.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.040]   I tried it on my iPad and it wasn't working.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   Oh, it didn't.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.040]   It's using flash.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   But look at these.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.040]   These trains here, you can actually see them moving.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.040]   It could have just been overloaded though, because it was on the day that it grew a bunch
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   of coverage.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   I wonder if it just couldn't be.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   It's a flash.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   Wouldn't be flash.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.040]   Would it?
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.240]   I mean, I don't think so.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.720]   So cool.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.920]   You can click on the stations for a local map of that station.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.240]   Yeah, you need this in New York, don't you, Gina?
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:24.760]   Yes, I would love to see this in New York, although compared to London, New York subway
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   system isn't so good.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.240]   Is this a little more complicated?
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.000]   It's a little more complicated.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.400]   They don't even they won't tell you like how many minutes until a train arrives or anything
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   like that.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.600]   But this will Baker Lutraine to Elephant and Castle.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.080]   I just love British stuff.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.520]   Left Baker Street Station, expected Regent's Park Station in 2.5 minutes.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.160]   I love this.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   That's great.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.160]   Really cool.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.520]   Metropolitan train to Uxbridge left Baker Street Station, expected Finchley Road Station in
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.520]   six minutes.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:56:00.000]   Hammersmith and Circle train to Richmond left Westminster Station, expected St James Park
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.960]   Station in 2.5 minutes.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:07.000]   You know, if you really want to do this, right, you do it in the accent of each of these regions.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.080]   Hi, Picadilly, trying to Picadilly, trying left Ploughlin, the Aladonian Road Station.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.440]   I didn't realize Australia was going to do that.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.400]   Yeah, no, I have a limited repertoire.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.200]   They all sound the same to me.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.360]   I'm sorry, I apologize Pete.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.880]   No, London accents are super challenging, even if you're British.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.520]   You need to be London or to be able to do that.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.520]   Just do the rhyming slang.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:33.920]   Yeah, that's a really neat aspect of mashups.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.480]   I've never seen a real time one like that.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.200]   That's very cool.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.760]   We have to talk about Google CL.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.840]   Okay, Google CL.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   You're excited.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.840]   What is it?
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.840]   We got to talk about Google CL.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:52.200]   It is a command line interface to a bunch of Google APIs, which I really did because I'm
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.440]   in a terminal all the time and I wrote this kind of command line to do task manager.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.440]   Yes, I love it.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.600]   Right up my alley.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.360]   So basically, once you install it, it's Python.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.680]   So you can install it on Mac or PC with PC.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.080]   You'll need something like Sigmund.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.920]   But you can type out a command line, something like...
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.400]   You download this as a download.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   Yeah, it's a download.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.400]   You have to download and install it.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.480]   And when you do, if you type Google at a command line, you get a bunch of options.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.520]   You can access Picasa, Docs, Calendar.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.920]   So you can type something like Google Calendar lists and it'll give you a list of events
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   from your account.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.760]   Oh my God.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.160]   Which is awesome.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.200]   And so you get all kind of the shell scripty goodness that you get in any script, right?
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.440]   So you can cron things.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.640]   You can echo and cat things.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:42.040]   You can edit a Google Doc in V.I.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   You can...
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   You're kidding.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   And how seriously you can.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   You can.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.640]   In fact, on the Friend feed, I linked the Life Hacker to the Great Feature like five ways
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.200]   that you can use Google CL.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.800]   You can cron back up so you can say every night, you know, go through my document list and
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.000]   save them in Google Docs, for example.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.480]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:07.720]   Yeah, you can pass the Google Docs command a dash, an editor parameter and specify the
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   editor you want to use.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:14.360]   And it definitely works with them and nano, I think.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.840]   So yeah, it's super cool.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:16.840]   So what do you need?
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.000]   Do you need Python?
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Could you do this on Windows?
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.920]   It's easy on the Mac because Mac has Python.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.640]   Yeah, you can totally do it on Windows.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   If you have something like Sigmund, yeah, you can do it on Windows.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.840]   So yeah, it's really neat.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:28.840]   I actually have it...
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.000]   I use GeekTool on the Mac, which is like a heads up display.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   It can embed...
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Oh, it goes on your desktop.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.960]   So are you Geek tooling Google?
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   What are you putting on there?
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.560]   I geek tool like today's events on my calendar.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.600]   Yeah, it's super neat.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.600]   It's super neat.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:47.680]   I'm actually gonna build an extension to my task manager, which lets you kind of add
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.360]   a command to your to-do list and also schedule it on your calendar in one shot.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.720]   So yeah, really neat.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.880]   I mean, not obviously useful to normals, but certainly to your listeners.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:58.880]   To us.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.880]   Yeah, to us.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880]   We're not normals.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:06.680]   Anyone who is in a terminal on a fairly regular basis will really kind of enjoy this.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.680]   I also have it...
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:11.960]   I set up my bash profile so that when I launch a terminal, it actually shows me my events
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   for the day.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   You know, kind of get the prompt.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   So you put in your prompt?
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   Yeah, so it's my prompt.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   I kind of...
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.760]   I just missed that on Smarter Weird Auto, or I want to see your prompt.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   I did.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.080]   It just says next 24 hours and then lists the events on my calendar.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.280]   So every time you hit return, it does that?
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.720]   Yeah, just when you launch a new window.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   Just when you launch a window, okay.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.720]   So it's like the one thing that runs before the first...
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.720]   It's not your prompt.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.720]   Right.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   It's not my prompt.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.040]   It's just the first thing that happened before on my initial prompt.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.040]   That is so funny.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.040]   So it's really...
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   It's neat.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.280]   It's really pretty neat.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   I haven't tried...
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:50.480]   I haven't messed around with the Docs editor yet, but that ended up itself.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   Well, it makes sense.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.160]   This is how they came up with it.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:58.880]   They say in the blog post that we wanted to upload a photo to a folder on Picasso without
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.880]   launching an application.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.720]   We wanted to do it from the command line.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   Of course.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   That's great.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.360]   And so it gives you access to the full API.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.640]   What do you have access to?
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.720]   If you type Google, once you have it installed, if you type Google at the command line, you
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.360]   get into an interactive command line.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.640]   So you can just type help and it'll show you all the commands that are available.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.560]   It's Picasso, Docs, Calendar.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.280]   And then you can say Google, you know, you can say Calendar help.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   Can you...
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.400]   And then you can see all the calendar specific options and parameters.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.800]   You can probably do searches too.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.080]   I'm not sure if search is in the list.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080]   Let's see.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   Wow.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.880]   It just seems like there's all sorts of ways you could use this with scripts and stuff.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   Yeah, totally.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   No.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880]   Search isn't included.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   It's Picasso Blogger.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.160]   So you can actually write a blog post at the command line, which I don't know when you'd
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.520]   ever want to do that.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.520]   But you can.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.400]   I mean, you can fetch blog posts.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.920]   You could have a blog backup script, for example.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.160]   You can post to YouTube.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.240]   So Docs, oh, contacts.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.680]   You can also export your contacts to a CSV every once in a while.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.160]   So if you're using Google Voice, this would be very useful.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.160]   And Calendar.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.160]   So hopefully, you know, every...
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.160]   You can post to YouTube.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.280]   Hey, this is actually good because we do currently post to YouTube programmatically.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   Mm-hmm.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   You can totally use this.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.840]   You're doing some sort of weird scraping thing.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.240]   I don't even know how they would do that.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.760]   But this would make that much easier.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Wow.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.560]   So if you have Python, is it 2.5 that you need?
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   Probably.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   Yeah, probably.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   Probably.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560]   Very cool.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   Yeah, it worked really.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.040]   I just installed on my Mac, just the Google part.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.600]   I think that's what the Mac comes with 2.5.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.720]   Yeah, I think the Mac does ship with 2.5.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.120]   It's Apache license.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.800]   And there's a Debian or a tarball you can get.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.920]   Look at that.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   This is so cool.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   And it looks like there...
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   What is this CL...
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   This code?
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   What is that?
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   QL code?
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   What is that?
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   That's the file download URL.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   Okay.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   Is it the file download or just the M.D.5?
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.760]   Well, I was wondering if it was the check sum, but when I hover the mouse over it says
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   the link.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.760]   So...
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.160]   Oh, so I guess you could install it on your phone?
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.400]   There's no command line in Android, is there?
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.200]   You know, actually there is.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.360]   Isn't there like an Android scripting environment, the ASE?
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.840]   I would like that.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840]   Interesting.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   I would like that.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.840]   So really, really digging the Google CL.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840]   Okay.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840]   I love it.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   I want more.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.840]   More, please, Google.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.840]   And that wasn't even Gina's tool of the week.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.600]   Wow.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.760]   Very geeky stuff.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.760]   Good though.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.240]   I like it.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.720]   Anything else we want to talk about before we get to our tip tool and number of the week?
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:45.000]   Dell is looking at Chrome OS for a future Dell.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   What tablets?
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Notebooks?
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   What?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   That's an interesting thought.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.920]   It was an interview with Dell's president for Greater China and South Asia.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.560]   He told Reuters, quote, "We have to have a point of view on the industry and technology
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.520]   direction two and three years down the road.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:03.160]   So we continually work with Google on this."
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:09.920]   Meet Dust says he also expects Chrome and Android to be part of a new form of computing.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:16.560]   So Dell is doing a smartphone, but I wonder maybe the Dell streak, which is, I think,
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.600]   isn't that the big phone with the big screen?
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   The Dell streak is huge.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.400]   It's like a machine iPad and an iPhone kind of size.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.920]   Maybe that will run Android.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.640]   That would be very interesting.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.520]   You know, I think the real loser in this is Microsoft again with Dell, obviously shipping
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.880]   a bunch of Microsoft PCs right now.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:41.600]   And suddenly everyone's jumping to Chrome to replace the kind of the full Windows 7 experience
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.120]   where they're jumping to Android on the phone.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.600]   So it's really Microsoft's loss is Google's gain right now.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   Yeah, this is Android.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.280]   Oh, this is sweet.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   Very sweet.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   The Dell streak.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280]   Got to take a look at that.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.960]   Looks like Asia only, but, uh, oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.960]   This story says Dell streak will probably be sold by a US carrier at some point.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.360]   I'm going to imagine that Chrome is going to be more of their netbook OS and that Android
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360]   is going to be the mobile and tablet OS.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.760]   It might more sense to echo what's already happening with iOS and the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.920]   That's what the Dell said at the DA conference that they, in fact, would sell it unlocked
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.360]   in the US and via wireless carrier.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.880]   $500 on Dell.com.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.320]   That could be a very surprising sleeper product for a Dell.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   It could be a big deal.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:31.320]   All right.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.560]   Because we got to keep going here.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.160]   We got another show to do in a few minutes and I want to get our guests out the door because
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.600]   I know, oh, my Nexus one came.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   Thank you.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.680]   And I have something else to do.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680]   Nice.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.040]   I've got a phone to judge.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.480]   Before we get to our tip and tool and number of the week, I'd like to welcome a new sponsor
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480]   to the show.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.880]   Very exciting about iStock photo.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.880]   Oh, cool.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.880]   You know about them.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880]   Yeah, I'd use them.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880]   Yeah, they're great.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   I love iStock photo.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.760]   Anybody use them for a lot of our images?
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   They're really good.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.680]   Anybody who blogs knows about them because it's a great way to get affordable images,
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.760]   licensed images for your blog.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:19.200]   In fact, if you go to iStock photo.com/twig, you can get a special deal on royalty free,

[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.440]   Oops, don't do TIG, do T-W-I-G.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.680]   I don't know what TIG gave me something odd.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.880]   I guess that's a person.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.120]   Oh, here it is.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.680]   Welcome all to a G-listeners, 15% off credits if you join right now.

[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.240]   You know, the name really is a little deceptive.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.720]   Illustrations and vector images, videos, music and sound effects, Flash files, 3D renders,
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.320]   and logos coming soon.

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.840]   Office plugin that makes it really easy to use.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.920]   And coming soon, an iPhone app.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.800]   I love this idea.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:29.000]   You'd be able to use an iPhone app to get to your iStock photos and get some royalty free
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   illustrations.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   iStockPhoto.com/twig.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.040]   Yeah, they really are a great company.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.480]   They're kind of the company for doing this.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.120]   If you're in the business, do what Pete and Gina do.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.320]   iStockPhoto.com/twig.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.520]   Gina, oh, Gina, time for your tip of the week.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.360]   I have two quick tips.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.360]   Yes.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.760]   First one for Android users.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.800]   I just discovered this this week and I blew my mind.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.120]   I had no idea it was there.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.800]   While you're typing on the default Android keyboard in Froyo, if you swipe your finger
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.600]   up above the keyboard, it will extend two more rows with numbers and punctuation.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:14.720]   So you don't have to tap the period to switch to the parentheses or the one, two, three.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.880]   And it took me a couple of times to get it right, but now I have it every time.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.880]   That's awesome.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.080]   Wipe your finger up and it extends two more rows.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.440]   You can see I have a picture over there on my blog that Leo is up on screen.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.320]   You must have 2.2 to do this, though.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   Yeah, it's only 2.2.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yeah, and it's really handy, especially for question marks and exclamation points.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.640]   I use it all the time.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.200]   Just swipe up and you keep your finger on the screen and then you just release when you
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.160]   hit the key that you want and it adds it to the...
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.160]   How does that...
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.840]   Doesn't it conflict with the swipe up to record thing?
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:49.040]   So you swipe left to right to start voice attacks.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040]   Well, that's right.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   It's left to right.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040]   Okay.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   Yeah, so this is up.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.840]   So you just take your finger and swipe it right up above the top of the keyboard and
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   it extends out.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:02.560]   And it extends out actually over your words suggestion list.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.160]   But it's just numbers and a little common punctuation.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.240]   Well, let's stay there or does it go away?
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   Yeah, it goes away.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.280]   So you swipe up and hold and then pick what you want.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.480]   You release on the key that you want and then it just snaps back in.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.440]   This might be a reason to leave swipe behind.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.520]   Yeah, it might be.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.120]   Are you still using Swiper?
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.360]   I actually switch back to the default keyboard.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   I'm just going to give it a go.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.360]   It's a this.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.120]   So I'm giving it another go this week.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.880]   Tip number two is for iPhone users who have iOS.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:34.960]   You can now sync your iPhone's notes to Gmail.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.140]   I haven't tried this myself but Google operating system wrote it up and I linked it on the
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.400]   front feed.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.560]   In your Gmail account information you can turn syncing on on notes and it actually shows
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.440]   up in your Gmail account under a label.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.600]   So before it was apparently really difficult for iPhone users to sync notes but this is
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.200]   a good sort of cloud, you know, notes to cloud solution.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.000]   So that's for iPhone users because we're always talking about Android users here.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.200]   Oh, I see where they wanted me to keep the battery in back.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.120]   They didn't include one.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   So you don't have two batteries.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.840]   Oh, you know, I don't.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.800]   You know, when you said that I was kind of like, I thought I would get a phone with its
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.960]   own with a battery in a back but it doesn't have one.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960]   I was kind of hoping for you.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.280]   I was kind of like, hmm, I don't, I didn't, maybe I did ship back the battery.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   No, I didn't.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   No, you only get one.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.280]   They just sent me the body.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   Sorry about that, Leo.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.280]   I didn't want to bust your bubble but I was kind of like, I don't have to be happy because
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:23.280]   I wish that I did.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   Google has busted my bubble.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.680]   HTC busted my bubble.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.400]   Two great tips.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   Sure.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   Just the greatest.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.800]   We let Pete Cashmoren do a number today.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   I do.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800]   I have two numbers.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.320]   My first number is 160,000.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:43.720]   That's number of Android devices being expected every day according to Google.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.520]   It was Andy Rubin at the Droid X event this morning.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.360]   It says 160,000 times 31.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.920]   Let me see.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.840]   Let me do the math.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.920]   That's almost 5 million handsets a month.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920]   Sure.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.640]   And that's versus the 100,000 that they were getting activated per day went to the end
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.320]   of it to Google I/O.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.800]   So really good growth rates for Android activations.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.960]   I feel like, I feel like eventually Android is going to win out in that battle of just
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.640]   the sheer number of phones that are running Android versus iOS.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.480]   They're just going to win on volume.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.400]   That's no kidding.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.400]   Wow.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   It's on the volume of apps so they're growing really fast.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.400]   So that's the second number.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400]   It's 68,000.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.320]   That's number of apps now in the marketplace.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.600]   Now, Apple's got what?
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600]   A quarter of a million.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.120]   But the point, if you've got 68,000, that means usually you have enough to cover the bases.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.760]   All you need is the one app that you need if you don't need five fart applications.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.520]   If you've got the one.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.960]   It's kind of interesting and I appreciate Gina's view on this.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.680]   But the thing we see about Android app development is while in theory you're eventually going
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.520]   to have a lot more devices running your apps, the disadvantages, that people really don't
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.880]   seem to be paying for Android apps to the degree that they're paying for iPhone apps.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:04.960]   There was a report out this week about there was some tiny percentage of Android apps are
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.840]   paid versus people are really paying for things on the iPad and iPhone.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.800]   I'm interested to see if that kind of hurts developer interest because obviously developers
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.400]   really gung hoe with more devices, more openness, more freedom.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.160]   But if there's less revenue, I wonder if that might be a counterpoint.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.440]   Yeah, I mean the revenue conversation is definitely something that comes into play.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.040]   I think that Android attracts a certain kind of developer, which is an open source developer
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.000]   who's used to releasing things that are generally free.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.720]   So I think it's kind of like, but I also think that mobile app developers who want to make
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:44.760]   money whose goal is to make some money is going to go to the iPhone because they go
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:50.680]   market share, market distribution, but also because I think that there's this perception
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.720]   that people don't pay for apps on Android.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720]   I have to tell you.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.320]   I wonder if that's fair though, is that fair?
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.840]   There's tons of apps on Android that I would pay for if I could, but they just they don't
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840]   have a price on them.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.200]   I think that developers generally make their apps free because that's just part of the
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.480]   open source culture.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.800]   I think that's just a cultural thing.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.320]   I think that's the case.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.680]   I think to make money on Android, absolutely.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:15.040]   I actually I would encourage Android developers who make great apps to charge for them, charge
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:21.520]   it buck or two, make some money, enjoy, enjoy, live, live, like so much.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.240]   The advantage the iPhone and iPad have there is that everyone's so trained with iTunes,
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   they've got their credit cards in there.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.920]   It's like a behavioral thing.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.200]   The whole world is trained now to the credit card into iTunes and then they get their iPhone
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.800]   and other iPad and they're just already set up to go.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.240]   Although it's you Google checkout on Android, so I have the same experience.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.000]   Does anyone really I mean I consider myself a heavy Google checkout user and I really
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.920]   I'm not crazy for the user experience there.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.200]   We buy a lot of our like on Google apps and that kind of thing and I don't think it's
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200]   just a thing.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.200]   Okay, I'll make a counter argument.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.960]   One of the things I really like about the Android store is if you download if you buy
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.840]   an app, download it and don't like it and delete it immediately, you have I don't know
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.640]   what 48 hours to get a refund.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.200]   We'll refund you the money automatically.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.440]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.680]   I mean, it will.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.040]   That's really great.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.760]   The iPhone doesn't do that.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.120]   You know, one of the reasons you don't necessarily try Masters of paid iPhone apps is exactly
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120]   that reason, like it's risk.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.880]   There's no way to try it.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.080]   Yeah, I mean you want to try something out and 99 cents is a good price to try something
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.880]   out without having a big commit.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.320]   But yeah, it's obviously better if you can get a refund.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.200]   So you haven't had that happen to you, Gina, but I frequently download applications and
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.480]   you go, Oh, what did I buy that for?
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.360]   You delete it within a day.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360]   You get the money back.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.360]   I didn't realize that.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360]   That's great.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.880]   I think a lot of people don't know about that.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.560]   Two good numbers of at least good numbers.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:49.200]   If you're a Google to very encouraging a numbers, my tool of the week, very simple tool, but
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.160]   something new added to a Google Docs, it allows you to do kind of in a primitive way, a little
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:01.120]   OCR now in Google Docs for images and PDFs.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.600]   So details, I apologize for this on Read Write Web, but you can also go to the Google operating
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.320]   system blog.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:14.720]   They've been playing this with us for a couple of months and you'll see when you upload PDFs
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:22.960]   or images, there's a new checkbox, convert text from PDF or image files to Google documents.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.200]   And Read Write Web says that it does work better with PDFs than JPEGs.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.600]   But I think that's kind of a nice feature.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.400]   So you'll see that in the upload area when you're doing the upload, you have a checkbox
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.560]   that can turn that feature on.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560]   Google CLL needs a parameter for this.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.560]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.560]   Then you'd have a man line OCR.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:52.120]   I mean, you could scan business cards and like, yeah, I'm just going to shut up.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.680]   It's just a cron job away.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.360]   That's why I like Gina.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.160]   It is always thinking, where is that to do the command line to do thing?
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160]   To do text.com.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.160]   T-O-D-O-T-E-X-T?
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160]   Uh-huh.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.160]   No, T-X-T.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:12.360]   Yeah, like the, yeah.com and that'll redirect you to the page.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.360]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   There it is.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   The to do text command line interface.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360]   Yes.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   This is a Merlin man kind of a thing.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   Totally.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.800]   This is totally like early life hacker obsessed with text files work.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.000]   We still are.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   We still are.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   They never get old.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   They never get old.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   They never get old.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   They're like black.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   They're like black.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   And soon with Google-ish features.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   Did you write this in Python?
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   It's a shell.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   It's all shell.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   I know.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   I don't know why I made that decision.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   That's nuts.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.600]   If I were to do it again, I would have done it in Python.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.800]   Has anybody's written any shell, the bash scripts?
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   It's just weird.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.800]   It is weird.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800]   It is weird.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.800]   I've moved.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.800]   I mean, I now install Z-Shell whenever I get a command line.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.800]   The Linux or Mac, I just put Z-Shell on it.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.800]   I'm not going to mess with this.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.600]   Although the shell scripting is just as stupid.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   And you can find her blog, smartaware.org.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.360]   Her book is the complete guide to go away with a completewayguide.com.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.720]   And she's a great regular on this show.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.280]   We always love to have her on.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.760]   And how is the-- I got-- I would thank you for the beta invite, by the way.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:20.760]   Oh, sure.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:21.760]   To think tank.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760]   To think tank.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.760]   Really neat.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   Right on.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.160]   Now, are you going to open that up?
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.840]   I guess you're just running it on your own server.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840]   So people are supposed to--
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   Yeah, I'm running up my own server server.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.880]   I'm getting folks with interesting data on there so I can test.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   So thank you for trying to--
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.480]   I gave you a lot of data, probably.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.320]   Yeah, you gave me a lot of data.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320]   Absolutely.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.320]   What do I do with it now, though?
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.520]   Is there anything I can do with it?
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.320]   Well, you should ask some questions and see what kind of replies you get back.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.320]   Okay.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.320]   Do some queries.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.040]   Yeah, do some queries and see how far your retweets reach and that kind of thing.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.680]   So I'm going to add a few more features.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   All right.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.680]   I'll email you about that.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   It's extremely polished.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.680]   I mean, it's really beautiful.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   It's really nice what you're doing.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.680]   Thank you.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:01.680]   Thank you for the OAuth tokens.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.680]   I got it.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.320]   I love knowing geeks because then you get emails like that.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.920]   Hey, thanks for the OAuth tokens.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.640]   It's really been great.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.160]   Pete Cashmore, he's a geek.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.800]   He's a little too good looking to be a geek, but yeah, he's a geek.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.480]   He's the guy who runs Mashable.com, M-A-S-H-A-B-L-E.com.

[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   Thank you, Pete.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:31.960]   Thanks, Liam.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.560]   We're going to hear more from him because I think he's going to move down our way sometime
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   soon.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.440]   Thank you all for being here.
