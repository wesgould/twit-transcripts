[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.360]   Just to see how screwed we are
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.320]   Well, you know, we are now that we're going through wait. It's not the second wave

[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.680]   Germany and France are shut down so I hear

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.000]   I tried this morning. I really did to watch the two-stimony
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.560]   How long did you last in this?
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.800]   Well, I I last about a minute that I turn it off. I said no Leo. This is your job. Oh
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.960]   Turn it back on in the last a couple minutes. I said, I don't care if it's my job. I
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.920]   Give up
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.920]   I give up
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.320]   Jeff, it's your job. You watched it right. It's your job. No, I just I just I take care of myself man
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.880]   Well, I saw a treat go by early on that one
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.080]   Member of Senate had said that fact-checking his censorship. Mm-hmm. That was it. Yeah
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   Did you watch it Matthew?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.440]   I watched it the way I normally watch these things which is through my Twitter feed. Yeah, so yeah, it's good to get the hot takes
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.400]   The you know the issue is really section 230 which you've talked about a lot on this show many many times
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200]   We have
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   sarcasm is a
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.080]   Ant knows we have it's all we talk about it seems like
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   But it may be as I was watching this I was thinking okay
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.960]   Maybe we could maybe we could because even the Democrats are this point saying we need to we need to modify it somehow
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.480]   right the notion of section 230 of the communications decency act of 1996 is
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.600]   that
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.240]   platforms like Twitter Facebook
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.840]   YouTube
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.480]   Are not publishers when they act as publishers there as responsible as any publisher and in fact the senators were
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:12.180]   Made a point of asking all of them. You know hey if you created some content that was
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.020]   Bad
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.080]   You would be responsible for it, right? And they all said yeah, we'd be responsible. That's not the issue the issue is at issue is
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.640]   These sites like Twitter and Facebook where people like you and me are putting up content are not to be held responsible
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.680]   for the content other people put on it because you know otherwise you wouldn't have a conversation on one
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.040]   Yeah, they'd be sued for libel. So if somebody went into our chatroom and said something libelous
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.480]   They that if I could be sued well that pretty quickly. I'm gonna get rid of the chatroom now
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   I can moderate the chatroom
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.440]   But if Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg said there's two billion daily active users on Facebook obviously camp
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.880]   In a timely fashion moderate everything even Twitter is hard pressed to moderate everything
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.560]   So I think we all agree that that part of section 230
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.480]   You know probably should be preserved. That's really important. It gives them
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.320]   Defense now there's another part of it which says they have the right to moderate and
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.120]   Maybe you thought affecting
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.440]   Their status is a publisher right right that's important that doesn't make them a publisher
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.220]   And we don't want to break that obviously because you want to give them the right to moderate
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.640]   What the goal is of this how would you mind modify section 230?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:44.000]   So so the funny thing is Leo just struck me that what Ron White who is the co author of section 230 says is that section 230 provides a sword and a shield
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.320]   But the shield says what you just said you're not gonna get in trouble with Matthew Ingram post something awful on your site
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   You know you're safe, right? What's happening?
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.860]   The sword is you are free to take down idiocy the Jeff Jarvis says on your site, right?
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:04.320]   So it just struck me that what's happening here is that from the left from the Democrats there getting in trouble for
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.360]   The sword the shield the shield the shield because you're not doing enough
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.640]   You're taking down all the stuff you should be taking out all the stuff right from the weight there in trouble for the sword
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   Do you take that hope he was he speech you took down my speech so you can't find a law that's gonna
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.720]   Peace both because they have conflicting goals because they're going to the other ones of it, right?
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.240]   Is there any type of balance that could happen with this
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.640]   With all of the technology that we have is there some way to strike a balance to keep everyone happy because we do
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.080]   Need to have some sort of moderation in there yet at the same time
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.840]   We don't need to Twitter and Facebook getting sued every ten minutes because some well is
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.480]   Exactly what 230 does it says we want you to have a conversation, but we want you to feel free to moderate
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.800]   You should moderate it's a good thing to moderate right, but what I've been in 10 of 230
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:00.560]   But what I've been in the hearings today was the arguments of of the moderation was either too lax or a source
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:09.360]   So where are we going to draw a line because we got to have this in place if there's going to be some sort of happen medium, right?
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.560]   I think we got to admit we we have to admit that the entire premise of this
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:23.120]   Hearing was in bad faith. So the whole reason they asked them to come was because they were mad that Facebook and Twitter
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.720]   Restricted the distribution of the New York Post story about 100 Biden's laptop
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.200]   So it doesn't really have you know, we can talk about the principles and so on
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.600]   I don't think I think very few of those certainly who were talking about it today
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:46.000]   care about the principles of section 230 they're looking for a way to beat up Twitter and Facebook for
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.160]   being biased against conservatives which a bunch of members of Congress continue to claim is is true even though
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.520]   Study after study shows it's not true
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.840]   But so they they need
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.360]   Some sort of stick to argue there's always some sort of what off though
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.080]   Where something's gonna look like it's shutting down the conservative side of things and letting the
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.760]   Liberal side just skate on bind is always gonna be a couple one-offs, right? Well goes both ways, right?
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:21.080]   So so so you have the left is screaming at Facebook that there the Zuckerberg is too close to the right and doing
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.920]   Things there and then you have the right screaming at Jack Dorsey
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.600]   The amazing moment today was was Ted Cruz saying to Dorsey who the hell elected you?
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.720]   Let's dig into that for just one second. Yeah, if anyone had a letter Jack Dorsey first amendment would stop him from doing things related to speech
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.640]   It's because no one has elected him that the first amendment protects what he does with speech
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.920]   We know the Constitution. I mean Ted Cruz is a lawyer. He knows this stuff
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.440]   This is completely disingenuous. It's not like he doesn't understand
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.760]   What section 230 does or what the first amendment does this is I mean his in particular?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.360]   The whole exercise was grandstanding to make him look like he's beating up on big tech
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.800]   So Ant I don't think the goal was to make anybody happy today
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.560]   The Ant was performative to just what Matthew said is can we beat up on places that are unpopular?
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.240]   That are made unpopular in the media narrative and the law is not gonna solve your problem, right?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.640]   It's about our norms. It's about what we do and
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   One I think the most interesting thing certainly of all three
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   CEOs was Mark Zuckerberg saying that he thinks section 230 should be modified
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.760]   Yeah, let me read someone like let me read sucks statements and then you could follow up Matthew
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:49.840]   He says section 230 made this is in the this is in Mike Maznick's article on tector from a couple of days ago
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   They already had the
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:00.440]   What does one of those gonna say in his opening remarks? I presume he followed this section 230 made it possible for every major
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.520]   Internet service to be built
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.840]   And ensure important values like free expression and openness were part of how
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   platforms operate okay, so far so good
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.040]   Changing it is a significant decision. However, I
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:22.400]   Believe Congress should update the law to make sure it's working as intended. This is purely a political statement obviously
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.160]   Oh, is it up? I don't think he really believes that but he's trying to somehow appease these guys
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.320]   we support the ideas around transparency and
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.360]   Industry collaboration that are being discussed in some of the current bipartisan proposals
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.080]   This is just word salad that means nothing and I look forward to a
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.040]   Meaningful dialogue about how we might update the law to deal with the problems we face today me
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   Well, can my debate about section 230 shows that people of all political persuasions are unhappy with a status quo
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.640]   Well, but for different reasons right people want to know that companies are taking responsibility for combating harmful
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.080]   Content especially illegal activity on their platform a lot of the questioning for Zuckerberg was well
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:11.160]   You allow people to say to kind of imply that the Holocaust didn't happen. He said that's yeah, that's not against our rules
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.000]   They want to know when platforms remove content that they are doing so fairly and transparently. Yes
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.760]   They want to make sure platforms are held accountable. I don't think that's unreasonable say that the problem is the devil's in the details
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   How do you do it?
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:33.960]   And I think go ahead now you can go ahead Matthew. Yeah, I was just gonna say that you know, whatever Zuckerberg says
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:40.920]   Yeah, I'm in favor of regulation. I think you should you know check your wallet or because he clearly has
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:49.600]   Unagenda and I think in this case it's that he knows people want to regulate section 230 and what he wants is for that regulation to
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.000]   To give Facebook effectively more power the risk is
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:14:02.240]   If there's regulation it could entrench Facebook's power instead of that is making harder for people to compete
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.000]   And I think that's a real risk if he if he gets the
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.440]   Interpretations of section 230 that he wants it could actually make Facebook more powerful
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   Europe is exactly what Mike Masnick says he says
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.240]   Mark knows full effing well
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.840]   That any regulations that Congress puts in place will simply serve to lock in Facebook's
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:32.960]   Position Facebook can handle the compliance costs the upstart companies that might disrupt Facebook will have a much harder time make no mistake about it
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:42.280]   This is Mark Zuckerberg pulling up the innovation ladder. He climbed behind him and and you know somebody else has pointed out that
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   In the current climate zuck can't just buy a competitor as he did with WhatsApp and
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.360]   Instagram he tried to do with a snapchat
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.280]   So he's got to find other ways to protect his incumbency and this is a very convenient way to do so
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:04.660]   Right and Zuck spent a hundred thirty million dollars to start the oversight board which the day after we
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.040]   Did our last show opened up for business have they heard any
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.200]   Pronos they just not been able to take so they're gonna get
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.240]   There were there were information sessions
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:23.280]   Laptops they have a lot of tops tied into their secret system
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   and a whole
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.080]   Or Nate structure one thing I didn't realize I don't know if you knew this Matthew since we've been following it too
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.040]   Is that for each of the cases there's a public comment period?
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:42.240]   So they we the plebs out here can comment on cases that come up before the oversight board
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.640]   Then the oversight board can go also go to outside experts
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.800]   And then what's gonna happen clearly so I've also talked to the other side of this at Facebook where they're gonna receive the rulings
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.560]   From the oversight board then they're gonna have to figure out how to implement them
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.160]   So there's more cost and structure on the Facebook side as well. Yeah, you're right
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.240]   This is all Facebook has the ability to weather any regulatory storm
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:10.480]   Is there any influence from those outside comments to do oversight board? We'll see what they do. There's a bunch of
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.640]   Sport could do that. Oh, sorry
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.280]   Yeah, there's I mean there's people I think are very smart and I respect Alan Rusper drew the former editor of the Guardian is one
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.800]   Of them on the oversight board. There's other people. I think they're gonna try to prove their independence
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.280]   I think they're gonna try to come up with tough stuff, but we'll see it proofing putting is it all
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.840]   Is it all irrelevant since the election is a few days away?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.880]   It'd be hard for Congress to do anything as a lame ducks in a lame duck session
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:44.640]   You know, I mean we'll see what the results of the election are maybe everybody will be in places they were before but I
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:52.120]   Mean really this is just in fact Amy Klobuchar former candidate for a president and senator on the committee
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.320]   Said this is just grandstanding the election is a few days away. Why are we holding these hearings now?
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:04.280]   This is you can't come up with with relief for the American people around COVID, but you can you can do this grandstanding, right? Yeah
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:11.840]   Yeah, and the only thing the only thing it suggests is that I mean Biden has talked about section 230
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.920]   He's talked about wanting to
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   Do something to it? I don't know if he's thought about it deeply but so it could you know some of this stuff could continue?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.440]   Even if he's I know people Matthew. I don't tech people not tech people. I know policy people
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:34.040]   I'm not talking about the platforms, but elsewhere who are making who have made contact long since Biden campaign saying whoa, Nilly
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:40.640]   Yeah, but you know, it's like it's a safe thing to say for anybody. We ought to do something about the weather. Yeah
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.600]   Good luck
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:48.120]   Good luck figuring out what to do, you know, it's raining an awful lot. What are we gonna do about that? I don't know
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:55.520]   The one thing I in terms of things to do I had a conversation with Alex Stamos a while back
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   who was the former head of
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.120]   security effectively at Facebook about
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.520]   what he thought
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.000]   Could be done to help prevent for example
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:16.640]   disinformation from being massively distributed on Facebook and his thought was that the more something goes viral the more
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.720]   Incombin it should be on Facebook to monitor it and to do something if necessary
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.520]   So if it's not reaching that many people then who cares?
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:33.440]   But if it is reaching millions in a matter of minutes then there's more on us on them to do something about it
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:41.600]   Though yeah, I'll so I'll so it still slippery slope, you know, just because it's not
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.600]   hitting
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   2 million people it doesn't make it a
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.980]   Valid statement, you know, I mean, that's the hard part is that everything, you know related to this is a slippery slope
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.000]   There is no easy
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.200]   Demarcation between what's viral and what's not
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.320]   Also, don't know how big any of this really is we can't we can't get the data
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.180]   There's this presumption that Facebook is a cesspool and my Facebook is not
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.600]   My Facebook is filled with ice cream
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:19.680]   And so how do we know how big it is we don't have the data the you know
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.200]   I'm gonna plug once more the transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression of which I was apart
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.280]   Says that we need a flexible framework of accountability out of transparency
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.600]   So we need to be able to know what data we can expect from the platforms government can ask for it
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.120]   It goes to researchers then we get some sense of the impact then we worry about
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.240]   interventions and what's working and what's not working but now it's all guesses and
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.200]   You blame the platforms for that too because they're holding the data back
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.900]   But then you blame government to because things like GDPR is what led Facebook to stop NYU from investigating the political
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:20:01.320]   I was just gonna ask you about that. Yes. So Facebook earlier this month shut down NYU's research project into political ad targeting
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.400]   They sought to shut it down. Did they actually shut it down? I don't know. Yes, they didn't actually shut it down. Oh really?
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   Okay, no
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.960]   Yeah, I think they were going to restrict it until the election was over
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.200]   Yeah, they're using scraping tools so it isn't in Facebook
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.520]   But still if what they did is they asked I think they asked people to give them their Facebook feeds, right?
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.880]   And yeah, and allow them to scrape it. It's a browser. It's a browser plug and I think yeah the markup is
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   Well, it looks at this. Yeah, but there's a there's a GDPR issue here
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.960]   Is it's one matter for it to know what you saw but it's what then what your friends saw the targeting?
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.800]   Where was explaining to me some time ago is that if a given ad is shown to aunt and
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:52.760]   You know what the targeting of that and that ad is you then know something about aunt that aunt may not have wanted
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   Anyone to know so there's a GDPR issue
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.160]   There's also Ben Thompson wrote about this and I thought made a good point that some of the stuff that Facebook
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:09.080]   Would be doing if it effectively gave the nod to this type of stuff would be things that are covered by the consent decree
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:14.880]   In fact, yes both consent decrees in which Facebook promised not to do this type of stuff
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.480]   So if it says oh go ahead or even just turns a blind eye to this kind of
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.640]   Scraping it could be seen as breaching the consent decree because it might be fine for me to share my
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.400]   What I'm doing on Facebook, but all of my friends and all of their stuff is in there too
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.760]   They didn't they didn't give their permission for me to share that
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:40.040]   So while it's tempting to say oh see this is the unintended consequence of these regulations
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.120]   It's preventing reasonable research from being done. Maybe it isn't an unintended consequence
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   Maybe really it is the right thing to do to say well your friends of friends information shouldn't be
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.760]   Offered up even if you say yes, just because you're running that browser plug it
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.040]   Facebook should have sat down and tried to figure out I think it's better. No matter what yeah
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:06.000]   They should have figured out a way to fit with you and work with them right and Facebook and Twitter for the past two years at least
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.560]   I've written about this have promised researchers all sorts of information
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:17.680]   And it takes ten times longer than everybody said it was going to and then the amount of information that comes out is tiny and useless
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.160]   You have to wonder if Facebook I
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   Mean honestly, they don't want this information. No, of course. They don't yeah
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:32.880]   So it's a convenient thing that it's illegal and and they don't want to but what I said to them I was at a meeting
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:39.840]   Brought together by people who are pretty anti-tech and and I face book it somewhere from Facebook was there and it's a chat
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.400]   And how so I guess I shouldn't say who was there but anyway
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   And we had the justice discussion I said why the hell can't you just release this stuff and then and then you well
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.600]   No, here's what's gonna happen?
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.440]   You know once once I know about aunt aunt can come back at me and say you violated my privacy because you really can't
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.600]   Know it world that I like barbecue, right?
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:07.240]   Well everybody knows barbecues the best thing ever invented so nothing wrong with that. What's the harm?
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   What's the harm in this cardiologist?
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.360]   That's true your insurance company might have something to say about that
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.000]   All right, so
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.320]   Should we just ignore these hearings? I mean that's kind of what after watching it for a while. I just tuned out because it's like
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:33.080]   Yeah, I think if you it's grand if you look at the if you look at the last hearing the one that was sort of the final hearing of the
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.560]   It was deep and meaningful. So that was right. So that had a lot of you know
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.880]   thoughtful questions
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.760]   Important questions. There were things raised that were actually
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.480]   Important there and it was a kind of a nice change from some of the grandstanding circus sideshow stuff
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:57.800]   And so this one we kind of reverted to form and it's just people waving and screaming and about things that they
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:04.520]   Are either deliberately misunderstanding or don't understand. Yeah, I watch for about it now
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.160]   And I see you watch for an hour aunt. You're a better man than I am. I watch for about it
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.480]   Let me go and tell you sir. I realize I didn't have my coffee this morning
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.120]   To complete that hour
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:24.120]   But in that that hour that I watched I didn't see a lot of grandstanding I saw a lot of tick for tack kind of talk or
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.240]   Like I said, they they actually did some research and didn't quite sound like a bunch of
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.800]   Hays ain't it this way grandpa's is just now seeing the computer for the first time
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.040]   It was
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.200]   It was it was okay. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be but again
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.760]   I still needed that cup of coffee just to get through that hour
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:49.400]   And frankly, this is you know, if you're a successful business in the United States, this is you know
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.080]   An ex part of the expectation. It's not like these guys. I mean they didn't have to fly anywhere
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.360]   You know they could do it from uh
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:04.440]   You know, I I just I don't I don't think this is going to sway any voters for sure so
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It has no value in the election
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.440]   It knows people didn't even understand I bet, you know
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.720]   Well people understand they understand in the in the shade of their political persuasion
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.200]   Because I hear from a lot of people say see that post suppression of that post article
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   Premi-fascia proof that uh twitter and facebook
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.880]   Right don't like the president and our knees gonna block stuff. Right and then people on the left said well
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.680]   Well, you know, I don't have to go into the
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.720]   The positioning but that's what they hear and but I don't think it's gonna change anybody's vote
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.480]   Um, but they didn't even talk about how facebook
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:48.920]   Mother Jones wrote about it Margaret Sullivan at the water. That's a really interesting question on it. Yeah, so they're suppressing
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.480]   effectively left leaning
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:57.400]   News and then favoring bright part and bench. Yeah, but there's Sullivan example
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.040]   um
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.920]   If you're facebook and you set a rule that says if you are paid for by parent primarily by a political organization
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.560]   Then that becomes a rule set by which they say that now we're not going to consider you news
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:17.320]   Not defending facebook here, but we but they try to come up with scalable rules and that example from
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.280]   from Margaret's column seemed a little bit
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.320]   not but I think it shows
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.800]   So I think it shows you that those rules are
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.640]   inevitably flawed bright bright part is funded by conservative, you know
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.000]   They just don't they just don't disclose it
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.880]   And so if you disclose it the way korea newsroom does or mother jones does then you get penalized if you don't disclose it
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.520]   Then you just get to be in the newsfeed even though
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.320]   You're you're running effectively disinformation
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:53.240]   Right, so they they have they have crews and they call people on the outside. I don't get anything for this
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.160]   I don't it's but they call they'll call 20 people on the outside to say let's just bounce stuff off
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.960]   Do you mind talking to us? And I always say okay any of the companies because I learned stuff too
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:07.320]   And they have people trying to decide this was this was like a year ago. What's a news organization?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.640]   Right, so they went through just this and they try to get other organizations outside to do it for them
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.680]   Right, do you have a list?
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Can we just use your list? You got a list? No, you don't know hell so we get to come up with our own rules
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.800]   Right, so they have it they have a sign up thing for news organizations
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.640]   And they set rules because people are gonna make them set rules because they want those rules when people go after them and yell at them and scream at them
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.120]   Then they want to say but but but we got rules
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.720]   So I guess the question is
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:41.640]   Is do you think facebook's operating in good faith in general and just it's a hard thing to do and they're doing their best they can
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   I I think it's a lot to accuse them of a bias one way or the other
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.360]   I feels like in both in both cases. They're just trying to do the best they can it's and it's a
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.000]   Far from perfect system. Is that fair? You agree aunt? How about you, Jeff?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.920]   I agree with you, but I still think on both sides of the spectrum facebook could could try harder
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.040]   And I know it's easy for me to say sitting here in my little comfy chair. It's hard. They got two billion
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.680]   Daily users
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   That's a lot of traffic
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:17.480]   It's a lot of traffic, but they're paying people a lot of money to come up with these solutions to you know, so
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.200]   Try hard. So and I think they could do better
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.240]   I I agree with you Leo. I think there's there's a few different layers here
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.520]   at the top I think you can
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.880]   Question motives at the worker B level
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.240]   There are people who are trying really hard to come up with reasonable things who were there for a reason
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.000]   um
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.760]   I think that if the australia and stuff we talked about a few weeks ago
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.840]   Let's say that they passed that law in australia and facebook says fine. We're pulling news off of facebook in australia
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.760]   And I think they're going to be secretly having champagne and smoked meat
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:59.400]   um in happiness because news causes a lot of problems and fine screw it. We're going to go back to getting
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.520]   Dates and life's going to be a lot easier
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.480]   Um, and it sets a precedent that I think is going to be dangerous for our industry and for our society
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.040]   Because if that's how people are finding out things and now they can't find it out. It's bad
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.280]   But I think that's that's kind of where we're headed almost
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.720]   Is can we can we either get rid of this? It's a pain in the ass
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.040]   Matthew do you think facebook is well intention, but
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.200]   It's just a hard thing to do and so it occasionally you get these
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.400]   mistakes
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.360]   Or is it intentional do you think they have a bias? Yes me
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:37.640]   Oh frozen, I think there's no question. It's am I frozen you're you're back. Yeah
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.920]   But larry
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.880]   Um
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.560]   I think there's no there's no question that it's a very very difficult
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   Job, I mean billions of pieces of content are posted, you know every hour probably right and they have to moderate all that somehow
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.800]   um
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:02.520]   But I think you know they're worth hundreds of billions of possibly trillions of dollars. So, uh
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.360]   you know
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.920]   Maybe they could try and do this in the election. They say they're going to do
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.400]   And and they could also be a whole lot more transparent about it
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:19.960]   It's fine to just wave your hands and say well, we're trying to hurt us, but there's no way of knowing that it's literally a black box
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:25.240]   Now on the other hand twitter employees are accusing jack dorsey of
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.880]   absentee management hands off
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:34.680]   Delegating decisions not really participating and looking at his beard. He's clearly putting a lot of energy. It's you're growing the beard
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:41.880]   Uh, let's ask the same question about twitter. Do you think twitter is doing the best it can do you think it's biased?
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.200]   Or is jack dorsey doing the best he can I doubt jack dorsey's
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.600]   Best he can he's got
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.240]   Other I mean that's fin criticism of him from the beginning. Oh a lot. He's running two gigantic companies
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.520]   Right, and he's not very involved in either one. Right, but here's here's the other but here he just just to play
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:04.200]   Big pong here, right? But people say zakabur should give up and delegate more power
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.040]   He's too powerful in facebook and then they say it's exactly what i was going with
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.360]   right
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.680]   Because sometimes being a good leader speaks to how well you delegate
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:22.920]   On however many different tasks you have where there's a big fortune 500 company or whatever or even just a a football
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.360]   Head coach gets a lot of credit. I don't do anything it's with
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:35.240]   I show up sit down and let you all do you hold that this now like no well. Yeah, thanks to my great weight
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.720]   Yeah
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.480]   There's a big political feature I put up on the rundown about the jaya gade
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.320]   who is the header policy at twitter and
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:51.480]   You know, she's she's making a lot of these decisions and she's rich i'm better and she's brilliant and um
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.440]   So yeah, he does delegate
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.680]   Shall I show the Ted Cruz a clip it's only about a minute
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.720]   Nice. I bear it if you're gonna come by my blood pressure medication first. Let's see if I can get it to
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:12.600]   And to look on dorsey's face at the words. I get it to play. It's not uh, I probably probably blocking the hill
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.400]   Okay, I'll get it from another source. Let's see
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:25.080]   Here we go. This is fox news. They should have better video. Yeah, let's see here
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:33.960]   uh senator Ted Cruz guerreles twitter ceo jack dorsey is not coming through here either
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.360]   Oh, there it is. Okay. Here we go
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:42.360]   Chairman want to thank you, mr. Chairman for holding this hearing
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:50.840]   The three witnesses we have before this committee today collectively pose I believe the single greatest threat to free speech in america
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:57.400]   And the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections. Well, let's talk about that. Is that really true? Is uh
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.920]   No, no, it's not true. It seems like social media
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:08.760]   For all its flaws is about free speech. Yes. Well, but that's for the president as well as his detractors
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.440]   Okay
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.520]   So and certainly the hyperbole of saying it's the greatest threat
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:22.440]   That's a that's a little statues point. It's just grandstand. That's a that's a little strong, isn't it?
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   Um, oh, I just I just lost the video. Oh, let's see here. Let's play it again. Okay. Okay, okay
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   We distracted you. Thank you, mr. Giorno. I
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.160]   Holding this hearing
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.800]   Okay, three witnesses we have before this committee today
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:43.160]   Collectively pose I believe the single greatest threat to free speech in america
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   And the greatest threat we have to free and fair elections
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.080]   Yesterday I spent a considerable amount of time speaking with both mr. Zuckerberg and mr. Pichai
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.680]   I have concerns about the behavior of both of their companies
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:04.040]   I would note that facebook is at the minimum at least trying to make some efforts in the direction of defending free speech
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.520]   I appreciate their doing so
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.280]   Is that fair do you think google then twitter are doing less?
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.000]   Oh, he's this is what he's gonna go. He's gonna
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.200]   Basically say but twitter takes down the new york post and so there are evil and awful right?
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.840]   Yeah, and it labels trump's tweets, right?
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.800]   Yeah, well did facebook did some of that too though, right?
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.440]   Mm-hmm. Yeah
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   from sharing those stories
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.560]   and number two you went even further
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.080]   And blocked the new york post from sharing on twitter its own reporting
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   Why did twitter make the decision to censor the new york post?
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.760]   We had a hack materials policy
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.720]   um that we went that policy adopted
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:53.000]   Uh in 2018 I believe in 2018 go ahead. What was what was the policy?
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.320]   So the policy is around limiting the spread of materials that are hacked
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.400]   Um, we didn't want twitter to be a distributor for hack materials
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.720]   Um, we found that the near post place jacket
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.160]   It showed the direct materials the whole look is very confusing to me. I don't
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.120]   Kind of
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.440]   That it felt that it fell under this policy
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.720]   No, so in your view if it's unclear the source of a document
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.080]   I see again. I can't watch it. I just can't do it
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.600]   These are your friends. Why are you doing this to us?
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   Twitter took it down initially because they were concerned the material was hacked material
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.680]   When they found out it was not they put it back up with a warning. Oh, what was it?
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.640]   No, they when they when they they they said the journalists
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.480]   Complained to them and said well, we also act material. So that's not a good policy fellas. Oh
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   So they changed their policy
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.280]   It wasn't it wasn't just that it was hacked material. It was that there was private information
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:36:00.520]   In the material. So both of those things are against twitter's terms of views. It wasn't one of this information
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:06.200]   So they said that too. They said it was election. It was election manipulation
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:12.920]   Basically what I talked to somebody in in the company and basically said whether it was accurate
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.720]   What I want what I want you to what I wish you would do is some point you guys in town someone value
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.720]   Just make some judgments and say
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:25.400]   This is trying to manipulate a election. We can figure out the details, but it's trying to manipulate a lecture clearly and we don't wait part of that
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.840]   And somebody said to me. Yeah, that's basically what happened, but then they've got to back up and they've got to put it in their statues
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.600]   and they kind of and the risk to me
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.680]   To me, I actually thought when they blocked the sharing of the link
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.920]   That that was a mistake
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:46.440]   And I think jac door see admitted later that that was a mistake and that they should not have blocked
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:52.520]   Anyone from sharing. I mean if you tried to share the link they would throw some stages. No, you can't do that
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.680]   It like I think
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.480]   Labeling it is fine showing someone a warning is fine
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.000]   Whatever reducing its distribution is fine
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   But but actually blocking people from sharing a link from a newspaper
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.200]   Seems to me to raise all sorts of and that's why I think everybody got their knickers in the twist
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   right
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:19.880]   It's difficult what's it's a nice jacket. I like that. Yeah, the beard I can do without but the jacket's nice
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.360]   It's a difficult thing to do and I think
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.640]   Let's ask the same question we asked about facebook about twitter. Are they
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:33.960]   Coming from the best of motives, but finding it difficult to the job or do you think they're biased? Matthew
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:41.560]   I don't think they're biased at all. I mean, I don't think they're organized enough to be biased to be honest. Like I don't think
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.800]   You know
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.040]   Their bias is towards free speech, right?
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:54.200]   They used to be the free speech wing of the free speech party was there so good. Yeah
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.240]   Man, they hate that that guy said that
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.280]   Yeah, because frankly if you're all about free speech you don't block or
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.240]   Band or do anything you just let everybody yeah everything go and actually biz
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.200]   I think biz and f both said the tweets must flow
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:17.160]   That was when they were being used as you know an information right vehicle during the era. They did not anticipate the the
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.800]   Trump yeah, it's one thing to say that when it's
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:27.000]   Egyptian rebels. There's another thing when it's the president tweeting, right, you know conspiracy theories about covid right
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.120]   so they're
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.600]   well intentioned by accident and
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:39.240]   But they're but they're struggling because it's a difficult thing to do. How about you jeff your your feelings on twitter
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.680]   Yeah, no, yeah, I don't I don't think they're they're biased as a company. I think that but that's
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:50.520]   But even there was a wonderful op-ed in the New York Times
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.720]   um from a month ago by Wesley Lowry who left the washington post because of his rule sentence
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.520]   and it said that
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.120]   The notion of objectivity that is to say a lack of bias is fundamentally
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.920]   racist
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   racist and that because it's who's deciding what's biased or what's not
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.600]   It's those who have the power to do so and who has the power people will look like me
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.320]   Right, then there's a very good book from lulis raven wallace called the view from somewhere
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.480]   Which goes to the same thing where he was accused. He's he's trans transgender
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.600]   He was accused of bias. Oh, you're too biased to cover lgbtq issues. Yeah, he was fired
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   it was fired as a result and
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.160]   And he said and he says in his book. I think quite eloquently
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.720]   Well
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.520]   a you know white people cover white people and it's not bias
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:44.920]   Be you're giving up my lived experience. You're saying that my lived experience is is not valuable in covering this
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:52.280]   You're calling that lived experience bias. So this whole question of bias and objectivity is is itself
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.920]   Fraud it's a power word. Yeah, I forget who said it
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.200]   Someone said reality has a well-known
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.840]   liberal bias
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.160]   A liberal no doubt
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   Although in Canada liberal means something different I as I believe but a little different
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.800]   Little in australia it means a lot different. Yeah
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.400]   Twitter bias or not
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.440]   Not biased racist
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.800]   I don't think they're racist either. But as I said about facebook they still can try harder, right?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.680]   Well with both of these platforms that the unintended consequences is
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.720]   Everybody has a voice. That's a great thing
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:41.080]   But it's also a little bit of a detriment that everybody has a voice to to be able to get out here on these platforms and just say what they
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.960]   Feel needs to be said and sometimes it's not necessarily the right thing to say
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.520]   But there's a lot of good that can come from both of these platforms, right?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.360]   Yep
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.760]   I second the motion. All right. Let's take a little break
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:02.040]   Fund to have all three of you here can do it. We can do a teaser here. We can see the future of government is not on zoom
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.040]   It's not on video
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.400]   it's

[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   No
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.920]   Are you going to finish that statement after the ad? I think he is that's Jeff. No, it's on twitch
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.040]   It's on twitch. That's the future of the future of deliberative democracy
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.240]   On twitch. Oh, that's a depressing thought, but you know what? I think we're headed that way actually
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:33.320]   You mean aoc playing among us among us. Did you see I went to biden hq and animal crossing biden's island?

[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   What are we talking? Are we talking about mongas?
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.760]   ARC and elan Omar joined twitch
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:01.000]   Uh and flam 140,000 people
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.800]   Played this game with which the kids love by the way. It's called among us
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.680]   And it's kind of like werewolf
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:15.400]   Many of us geeks have played uh were wolf the idea is you're on a spaceship or mafia. Yep. Same thing
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.880]   uh, you're on a spaceship
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.920]   and uh
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:24.520]   Some of you are crew members, but some of you are imposters and the goal is to
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.960]   Keep the ship a fly in with while you find the imposters before they can crash the ship
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.920]   But but the point of it like werewolf like mafia is it's a social game
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.320]   And and when we play werewolf and mafia matthew. We've always played it in a room with people
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.360]   It's so much. I remember playing it at a food camp
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:48.840]   With about 20 people was so much fun. I think we played with enough beer deep into the night
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.800]   It's just it's great
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.440]   But what the by the young people like it right now is because it's it's a social event
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.280]   You can you talk the whole idea is you find out who's an imposter by quizzing them
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.040]   So it's a real it's a chance to have a social group over
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.040]   uh, you get to
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.560]   To the lie and then right rub it into people afterwards or kill people and run people out
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.680]   Yeah, which I think is is great. So aoc
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.440]   Because she's young
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.000]   She she had never done it apparently
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.720]   um
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   but apparently uh, she
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.760]   uh, she did it with
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   uh, has son
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   Piker or has son obby you know him from the young turks. He used to be on the young turks and uh, he's a popular
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.000]   uh streamer
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.480]   So he recount put together a a highlight two minute highlight reel. Okay. Where is it? Okay? Is it on there?
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.240]   It's online number
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.480]   Top moments here it is on youtube. Let's play it because I I actually haven't seen this yet

[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   Alexandria ocasio or kes was Cortez, which is a lot of words
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.560]   Aocia's so much easier
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.720]   Is there a way to mute myself?
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   Yes on this
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.120]   Bragg snack

[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.120]   Was she the imposter? I have to do it. Yeah, she was
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:49.240]   Wow
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.840]   How do I call a meeting? Oh, it's totally toast. How do I call a meeting?
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.840]   Good
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   I
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:10.760]   Passed aoc on my way up. Did you murder myth and cold blood up there? Me? Mm-hmm
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   No, that's good enough for me. She's a lousy liar. I'm so
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:23.880]   I totally don't believe it. So this is a really fun game. Now. I'm murdering a sitting congresswoman
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   After everything we've been
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   This was to get people to vote, right? Yeah, but I think it also maybe won some fans among people under 25
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.960]   Yeah, so it's really cool. I mean, it's great
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.840]   And I had shown uh, I didn't bring my Nintendo switch with me or I would show you again
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.960]   But I had shown on other shows. I think is a tweet somewhere
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:53.160]   Of me getting a selfie getting on the selfie line in animal crossing
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.200]   It's frontier. Oh my god. There's a you know, you can if you go to bed you dream and then
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.480]   Luna the dream tape here comes and says I'm not making this up
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.240]   Would you like to visit another island a dream island? And I said yes
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.520]   I want to visit biden hq and they somebody on the biden campaign has clearly and
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:18.280]   Spent way too much time playing animal crossing. They've set up a whole how here it is. They set up a whole island
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.600]   So what do you do? We don't start we go to sleep. This is gonna take forever
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.680]   Uh, but they've said look at this. This is a fun game. Please don't judge me
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.560]   Um, it's complete ways to time
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.720]   Okay, so we get a little cut down. I'm gonna dream and we're gonna go to the tape here
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.440]   um, but the whole idea of this
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:44.040]   Is uh, it's a campaign thing so they have uh mentions of I will vote
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.440]   And there's kind of a robot biden, you know, it's him because he's wearing aviator shades
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.800]   Wandering around you can get selfies with him and then you can also
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.600]   Uh for free get a yard sign or a beanie. I have a beanie you can see i'm wearing my biden harris beanie
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.080]   I also you'll be happy to know jeff have a
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:07.960]   Kamala tank top I can wear this I was fine for the Kamala part you want a tank top. I'm not crazy. It's not me
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.160]   It's that thing
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.960]   He's much
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.040]   He's much cuter
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:18.280]   Then I am okay now we're dreaming. We're dreaming. We're going to biden hq the dream
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.440]   Here I am
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   This is crazy
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:28.760]   Biden says I think it's interesting that campaigns are doing this. I mean, obviously it's to appeal to young people, right?
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.040]   Although I kind of thought it was pretty fun
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:35.560]   All right, I turned off the sound goodness
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.640]   This the I think the rate I was doing on this on the radio show. I think so. I don't want the
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.920]   So you can wander around you can get pictures
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:48.440]   I guess this is why my hard hits think you're so cool and I am not today play this game
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.080]   So here's the rope line see it says I will vote.com
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:59.880]   And i'm looking for joe. Where's joe? There's the rope line. Oh, where's joe? I know he's here somewhere
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.160]   No
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.840]   The I guess I get the basement. Yeah, well, I get raised in his basement
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:13.880]   I gather the way this there he is there he is up very very hard to get a selfie with him because he doesn't have much attention
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:20.040]   Do you I got a fire of the camera get it all like oh he's going away now
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.080]   He's he's a he's a bot. He's not there's no
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:28.280]   The other part of that in there. Yeah, wouldn't that be funny? You can get a hat that says no malarkey
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.840]   Which I kind of like yeah, that's pretty good. And I'm gonna just get a quick
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:38.920]   I don't know. I'm messing with all the settings here. This is really boring. Cut down should have cut all this stuff out
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.880]   Do it already. Yeah, do it. Are you see he keeps going back and forth?
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.440]   I've actually got a selfie at home filter on yeah
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:54.200]   No, no, I'm trying. Yeah, he's gonna come back. He's okay. I don't know why but for every time I pose with this guy
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.520]   It's in front of a garbage can. I don't know why that is
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.920]   It's in the soda machines and there we go. We got a selfie with it
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:07.960]   He doesn't really look like joe, but I don't really look like me. So it's a perfect there. We go. That's my selfie
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:15.880]   With a candidate. I would do it with with Donald, but I don't I don't see him in the animal crossing
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:24.120]   I think it's interesting campaigns are doing this I do I don't do you see anything wrong with it? Is it is it to me?
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:28.440]   It's got a real hello fellow kids sort of feel
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:36.040]   Yeah, hello fellow kids. Who is that? I also like music band. That was um
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   crap
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.760]   Typically when candidates do this kind of thing
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:48.360]   um, it falls flat like hello fellow kids did but um
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.800]   I know it doesn't feel like it fell so flat this time
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.400]   Like that it you know it felt like it went to kids and I
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:02.840]   Spoked them in a level that they can identify with she's young a OC. So yeah, it doesn't it doesn't so weird
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.320]   And it's a valiant effort. It's a valiant effort. I can't see a link in
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.600]   Playing you know, I plan one of these games, but you know times have changed
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.520]   Steve go to the theater. Yeah, he did go to the theater. We
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:23.640]   There's sometimes their efforts like this that come off as really really forced right that that didn't look that way
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.480]   Did you feel that way to me either? Okay humanized or I thought okay. Yeah
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:33.240]   Uh, we are as you know heading towards an election this Tuesday. In fact the next time
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.560]   We uh, yeah, you've heard that perhaps
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:42.440]   Uh, you're just a digital story me. So am I supposed to go vote now? Uh, if you haven't voted
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.200]   I'm gonna send you out the door right now. You voted already haven't you?
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.080]   Are you in the animal crossing?
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.480]   And that would be devoted. That's just a matter of time before we have our votes in animal crossing
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.240]   but um
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   There is a lot being done
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:01.160]   Between now and tuesday to kind of prepare for this
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.360]   Uh, both google and facebook are banning election ads after the election
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.800]   What what's the point of that? I don't i'm not sure I understand that
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:16.120]   Uh because uh people claiming that it was lost or was rigged against this information
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.680]   Yeah, it's it's trying to do not getting people all riled up right after the election
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.400]   Stopping civil war that kind of stuff
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:28.200]   Uh, twitter is launching something called pre-bunks
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.720]   Uh instead of debunks, they'll preemptively debunk false information
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.640]   But we not
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.440]   Could we not use the term pre-bunk pre-bunk? It's not a good
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.360]   Says the writer in him
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.720]   Uh
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:49.480]   They've never done this before it's not a reaction to an existing tweet with misinformation. It's just gonna be
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.360]   up at the top of the
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:57.880]   Uh fee that's just called distributing facts. I know pre-bunking sounds cool, but
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   Yeah, no it doesn't
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.000]   Terrible
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   He's looking all condescendingly at us
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:12.920]   wiki pedia which uh actually i've always had very good news
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.640]   pages they have an election
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.800]   2020 page and they've already done a lot of things
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.560]   to lock it down before the election
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.720]   um
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.640]   I don't want to
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.800]   You know be overly skeptical, but the people that i'm concerned about
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:36.360]   Uh are not going to see any of those things that you just mentioned. Okay
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:40.760]   Okay, yeah, I mean most people get their news from the tv
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:47.080]   And uh and they're going to go to their station of choice the station that affirms their existing beliefs
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.000]   Right. Yeah, so john hannity's going to tell them what they want to hear right?
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.520]   So it's going to be there's no warning flags on the hannity show
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.240]   it's always an interesting exercise for me to to
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:05.000]   Tune between msnbc fox news and cnn and get really three different views of the world completely different narratives
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:11.880]   completely different narratives and I think I will do that on election eve be election night because um I can imagine
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.840]   do you think do you think so that
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:19.000]   I think there I think there's been enough information put out
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.840]   Uh, it's been hammered home over the last few weeks
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.880]   That we may not know the winner
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:29.000]   on election night
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.160]   Somebody may be ahead on election night, but because there are we've already had
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.040]   50 of the total voting
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.400]   For in 2016 has already happened
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.640]   Early voting both states. They can't count it until election, but you can't count it
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:50.280]   So those votes will be counted after the in person votes so you'll get this flood of in person votes
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.960]   but that is
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.640]   Probably no more than half the total vote in fact likely less
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.240]   So what so I think that we've been pre-bunked
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.600]   Pretty thoroughly by yeah, I think people have
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:06.680]   Word but then you know saying that he wants to cut off counting on election night
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.680]   Which of course he has no authority to do but he'll say that and so I didn't even happens past that
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:16.520]   We'll somehow be seeing his fake vote. It is weird disinformation to say oh, uh, it's ill
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.600]   He said it's illegal
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.920]   To not have the results come in right away
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.640]   Like
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:28.920]   No, it's not in fact it's it's before the telegraph. How do you think we did that? It's completely planned for by
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:36.040]   Uh the constitution it doesn't even require that the you know need it for the December 10th. You had the December 10th, so
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.560]   Um
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:44.440]   Yeah, so I I hope I would think that you know what's gonna happen on election night. You know what i'm dreading
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.480]   is
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:55.000]   Couple things one we're not gonna know and so you have on the air people filling time with speculation and meaningless father two
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.800]   When the polls close there is a fact we just don't know it yet
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:05.240]   Right and so all this talk about the horse race continuing about oh, we're gonna catch up more in Miami better better get a more
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:10.040]   For a lot of dale right is is ridiculous. There's a fact that's just not known yet
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:16.600]   Because all it is it's gonna remind us like it's an entertainment show a lot of the year 2000 right where
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:23.400]   Was it the one where tim russer had the white board he kept going florida florida florida florida
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.120]   Yeah, and it turned out he was right and it was a handful of votes in florida the side of the election
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.240]   But not till the supreme court got involved much later
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:37.400]   And the week counts and the endless thing so we didn't know it we didn't know in 2000 for weeks right? How long did it take?
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.960]   Long time so just imagine that
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.040]   imagine that with all the
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.480]   hanging chats and all that stuff that everybody was in the
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.600]   Rumors and conspiracy theories so imagine that but with twitter and facebook
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:58.760]   So that's why i'm bringing this up. I mean that's the tech angle to this is where are you gonna go in this modern age from in 2000
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.840]   It was it was hysterical harry macraken
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.480]   Uh tweeted maybe I could find it a picture of how we kept up with election of results in the year 2000
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.000]   Which does 2000 sounds modern doesn't it sure does
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.560]   Let me find harry's uh tweet. It's it's actually very funny
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:23.560]   I'm sitting here thinking so wednesday. I would I just need to stay off the internet, but
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.560]   We have a show on wednesday. So yeah, we'll be here
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.160]   Yeah, we're gonna be talking about it aunt
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.640]   Not gonna be won't be able to avoid it you're gonna you're gonna be but basically if you if aunt
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.440]   If you don't know what happened you can just check out my face at the beginning of the show and you'll know
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.000]   Oh, yes. Yes. That's probably
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.200]   Either be inter will be either be energetic or really
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.080]   mopey
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.360]   I'll be
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.280]   Uh here is here is how we here is how we followed the election in the year
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.640]   2000 that's a palm pilot
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.760]   And the gore campaign
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:04.840]   Ads saying subscribe to the mobile edition of gore 2000. How do you do it? You get avant go remember this
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:14.520]   Ava goes free software. You can download the gore mobile edition and receive new information every time you sync your handhold
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.680]   We recommend you synchronize at least twice a week
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:25.560]   Twice a week twice a week. I'm amazed they didn't have a dot moby site. There's not a big dude back then
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.040]   Imagine the twice a week twitter you only get it twice a week
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:37.320]   Just download it's good idea so much anxiety not a bad idea. I think Matthew. Let's let's go start a business. Hey, you want in
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.000]   Oh, I don't know that's that's so much anxiety right here
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.040]   I just I just think this is you feel like 2000 wasn't that long ago kind of the modern era
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.280]   It's at least in this century supposed to be the modern era this this is quite a bit different even than 2016
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.680]   Really right?
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.280]   Uh, we we knew what was we knew what happened in 2016 that evening. I remember I very much remember
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.560]   Uh, so I thought it was a joke quite yeah
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.720]   Yeah, it was a joke. So where are you yeah? I can't imagine what you and canada thought
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.440]   Just not very funny. No
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.840]   um
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:25.000]   So is answer advice the proper advice just stay off of all those social nobody's gonna be able to do that
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.000]   I'm gonna be glued to twitter. I'm gonna have three tv screens with all three networks twitter in front of me
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.120]   challenge accepted
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:50.280]   Um, I guess there's there's really no antidote for this but everybody's google's partnering with the associated press
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:56.200]   Um, they're gonna have I guess for authoritative results. I don't know
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:03.000]   Um, there's gonna be a lot of spin isn't there on twitter
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.960]   uh facebook
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.000]   It's really twitter and facebook those are the only two that are fast enough right right?
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.240]   Right. All right. Well, they'll be tick tock fun too. Sarah cooper are we going?
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.760]   I don't you know do people go to tick tock for breaking news breaking news? No, no, no, but there were even they'll be reaction
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.960]   They'll be some of the memes are gonna be there. I won't have an hour
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:29.240]   You won't have to go to tick tock or twitch because if anything if anybody does anything good or funny or important
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.720]   But weird it goes right on twitter so twitter is really all you're gonna need
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.400]   That's and this is where twitter is very interesting. This really has become
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.480]   the
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:44.120]   Pulse of the nation in some at least some part of our good hand bad
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.240]   Good and bad
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.920]   Or part thereof
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.120]   Right, that's the I get angry people say twitter is not in the country neither is the readership the New York times
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.760]   So relax right but but yeah, it is it is a subset
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.680]   There's subsets subsets put that interesting though that there's a gigantic
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.760]   Venn diagram. Yeah, yeah, sorry
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.320]   I was just gonna say that uh, I was thinking about the study that
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:20.360]   Yokey Benkler at harvard was involved with and basically one of the conclusions he came to was that
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.400]   um fox news is
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.760]   As big a problem if not bigger if then twitter
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.320]   Yeah
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.600]   You did a book on it in fact not just foxy but there's other twitters that I recommend this book last week
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.480]   the other twitters
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:43.400]   Was distributed distributed blackness african-american cybercultures by on dre brock jr. It's superb. It's academic
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.080]   but superb
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.080]   Listen to me
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:54.520]   Right, but it but it it one has to be aware that there's not one twitter
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   Oh, no two people on earth see the same twitter. We all see the communities on twitter
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.840]   And and there's different languages there. There's different ways to present there's different
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:09.160]   Would this be a good time to seek out some twitter lists like a black twitter list or
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:17.080]   Um, I mean this would be good time to have some lists ready. Yes. Yeah would be to get to see the subcultures
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.480]   That's where twiitik is great. You could have a column for each list
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.520]   I'm gonna need a wider screen. I think
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:30.680]   Oh, Lisa's ready. She's got a little bit of a fine foot wide screen
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:37.400]   Let me say this maybe I'll stay off of the internet, but i'm gonna come and watch you on the internet
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.320]   I should stream me going crazy
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.320]   It'd be kind of interesting to have to have aunt
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.920]   Absolutely in a a padded cell
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.040]   Until the show starts on by the day. Can you promise that you will not
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:00.360]   You won't you just kind of just and then we can leave them all or we can we can make them guess what happened
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:05.560]   We can get any soap you want me to just show up for the show on Wednesday. Yeah, but not have it
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:13.320]   No, I wouldn't do that to you. Don't let queen pruit tell you don't let the hardheads tell you
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:21.160]   That's the problem is the family. They will just tell y'all talkative about it in quite emotional one way or another, you know
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.800]   This is unlike 2016 is certainly unlike 2000
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.480]   Uh, this is a it's a unique moment
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:34.200]   We're in and I do think that the internet is going to be a big player and all of us as are that
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.640]   24-hour news channels. I think benckler's actually right
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:44.360]   Okay, I thought we should cover that. I don't know what else to say about it. It's just uh
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.880]   The next time you see us where these you're gonna be happier said
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:55.000]   Or just hang out with kylo because kylo can't tell me anything. Yeah, there you go. No, it doesn't care doesn't care at all
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.720]   Oh, the dog is gonna pick up the mood from the rest of the house
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.840]   You're gonna know that way. What do you always think so?
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:11.560]   Have have you seen evidence of effective russian interference or any other nation state interference? There was the
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:18.600]   Silly emails that the iranians sent saying we know you're a democrat, but you better vote for trump or will know
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:26.840]   And I mean there was that I don't know how effective that campaign was but have you have we seen any effective interference from any country
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.920]   Not really it seems not really it seems not
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.040]   um
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.320]   That's I guess it's hard to say this is where it'd be nice to say whether it's effective or not
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.840]   This would be where it'd be really nice to see those ads on facebook that are
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:49.960]   You know, oh you have such a narrow slice. They're very dark. Is there there's no way jeff to do that or is there now?
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:55.080]   Or face, but there's no facebook reporting tool on ad campaigns or anything like that
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.640]   Or as a political ads. Yeah, there is
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.280]   So we could see I remember last time
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.600]   2016 there were a lot of
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.400]   You know the russian troll farm created a lot of ads
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.560]   designed to
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.400]   Confuse and upset and things like that. I wonder if that's happening now
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.040]   It's definitely has been happening. I mean they took down a big
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.440]   Big
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.800]   Coordinated in authentic behavior network as they like to call it
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.240]   uh that I think they said was directed from Iran
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.400]   but um
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.800]   Whether they're effective or not only facebook knows for sure, right? There's no way to tell
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.000]   And if they're as you said, they're their intention in many cases is just as so
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:45.640]   You know confusion and chaos. So did that happen? I mean, I know lots of people who are confused, but is that why? I don't know
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.240]   They're confused because they're confused. Life is confusing
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.680]   Whoa, okay, so I just I just
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.960]   All right, so this says
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.280]   It is paid for by donald trump
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.080]   Junior for president ink. Yeah a picture of joe biden the worst possible person to imagine
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.160]   We cannot let the extreme left radical left takeover vote early
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.280]   Um, and it's the worst picture you could imagine. It just makes them look as ugly and old as you can imagine
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.920]   Let's see now. You kind of go in here
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.320]   Lots of donald trumpets lots of fine your fine early and vote often
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.760]   Yeah, if you if you go to the facebook
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.480]   um
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.680]   political ad database put in the united states and then I just put in the word voting
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.240]   And
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.200]   So you can see lots of them bottom of them, you know
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:44.120]   A lot of new stories in the last a few weeks about how the trump campaign has run
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.960]   Low on funds. They pulled their ad tv ads out of
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:55.400]   florida, but I often think when I see that here that doesn't mean they're not advertising on the much more efficient
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:02.840]   Facebook that's where they they did so well in 2016. Yeah, in fact, I think there's been things considerably more this time
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:09.080]   Oh interesting. So not having tv ads in florida may not make any difference at all
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:14.120]   They're not yeah
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:20.440]   So if i here's the ad spend tracker for the last week october 20th through 26
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:25.000]   Uh biden has spent 8.7 million on this is facebook
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.120]   Kamala Harris 1 million donald trump 5.67 micpence
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.480]   Really a laggard here 200 not 29 000
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.720]   Um, but by what's to advertise about micpence?
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.480]   Uh
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.360]   So that's interesting. So this is the spending tracker on
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.960]   This is on the facebook ad library page
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:54.840]   Uh, but that's spent by the campaigns right not by packs or other people. Yeah, i think of that case
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.160]   On their bed. Well, yeah, this is for that. This has been a stressful time
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:06.120]   Yet jubilant time of year from my mother because i've mentioned before she's an ad sales and she loves it
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:13.560]   Right. So of course with these campaigns spending gazillion dollars the other clients that she works with they're
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.120]   Spending just this much
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.640]   Is she a printer broadcast?
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:27.320]   She's she's happy days. Yeah, yeah, she's she's loving it. I'm thinking she's gonna get me a coffee maker
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.840]   Have you
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.960]   Have you heard any political ads on podcasts?
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   Uh a couple times I have i'm asking for a friend
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.680]   So we we got we got no requests at all
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.720]   From from either side
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.240]   Yeah, I've got a couple times I have so you have on your podcast site. That's interesting
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.840]   This is you have any guess
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.120]   You can't have asked this question, but do you have any guests with the political makeup up is of the twit audience?
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:03.480]   It's actually surprisingly mixed. I think we've chased away. I think we've chased away all the trump voters
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:10.280]   But early on it certainly on this show, but I think early on it was uh pretty evenly mixed
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.200]   um
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.120]   and uh
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.320]   Yeah, I don't think tech has a political bias particularly so
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:25.480]   uh, it was it was depends on who you asked. Yeah, well it was evenly mixed and then uh because uh, I have
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.520]   done a poor job of keeping my
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.400]   political uh
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.360]   Ask my political opinions to myself. I think I've chased away
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:44.280]   Everybody who jeff hasn't chased away already. Yeah, I I so I can't I can't help myself. Sorry. It's funny. You know, uh
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.160]   I hear
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:52.040]   I get a lot of emails from people say how dare you even talk about politics, but
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:13:00.600]   It's kind of part of the equation these days. You can't not get off the show with testimony before congress having an impact on technology
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:09.000]   Yeah, right and I get where a lot of those audience members are coming from because they're used to hearing about the nuts and bolts and the bits and bites and things of that nature
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.240]   But right now in 2020 this
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:18.600]   This tech is politicized whether we want to believe it or not. It's politicized. It's also uh
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.000]   Kind of a maturity in general in that I think in tech coverage
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.960]   Because for a long time it was, you know, they just want to hear about the latest phone or the gadget or whatever
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.040]   but I think uh
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.120]   As as tech works its way into the mainstream it impacts everything
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:41.240]   And I think it would it would be a mistake for us to not talk about the impact of tech as well as you know, what's the latest gadget?
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   Right even with the latest gadgets though
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:49.480]   What's the latest iPhone or whatever? There are some sort of political implications regarding
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.160]   Where that thing is manufactured versus where is designed?
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:14:00.040]   You know, that's that's a reality. All right. Let's take a little break. Uh, there is other stuff to talk. I have some gadgets we can
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.600]   We can actually
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:09.560]   Talk about some gadgets in just a bit. No more no more political talk. You can you can tune back in our show today brought to you by net suite

[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.880]   For supporting us by going to that special address that way. They know you saw it here net suite
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.440]   dot com slash
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.720]   twig
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.160]   I uh was
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.760]   Avoiding getting one of these remember remember we were talking about it
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:01.560]   Because I didn't want I don't have a facebook account and facebook was insisting that you make a real account
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:08.360]   With real information that you actually use if you want to use the oculus quest and then there was a story
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.200]   Actually came out of a release by uh by facebook
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.120]   That if you used your facebook account on more than one oculus device
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.640]   You'd be violating terms of service and they'd yank you
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.840]   Uh, they have updated this now. This was corrected on sunday
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560]   oculus, uh
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.880]   Says that's not that's not true
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.080]   You will be able to use two different
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.960]   Uh, I have a rift and a quest and it says yo, and you can use both
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:44.600]   Without getting your account deactivated. I mean it's one thing to say oh you can't do that
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.880]   But nothing to actually ban you and kill your account
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.000]   um
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.440]   Honestly
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.000]   It's just it's just gets worse and worse and that's good news that they clarified it
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.840]   But you know what would be better news what not tying facebook to these hard things of hardware. Thank you great
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:10.680]   Especially right now with the pressure they're under
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.640]   It seems like a I wonder if it's gonna hurt him
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.120]   I guess i guess i guess everybody that they might buy that might buy a quest has a facebook account
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.240]   But I don't and it's gonna keep me from buying the quest to for sure
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:29.880]   They're crying. I know they're crying. I know they can't they can't can't live with me can't live without me. I know how this facebook
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:34.120]   Facebook can't live with apple
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:39.720]   Uh like so many others they're not going to launch their cloud game platform on ios
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.240]   Because of quote apples arbitrary
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.800]   policies
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:51.160]   Microsoft's doing the same thing mikersof said we're going to do a web based version of our gaming platform x cloud
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.560]   Uh sometime next year goo facebook says yeah, we'll probably do the same thing
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:00.520]   It's the only way you can do it. Otherwise, you know, you can't get in the app store
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:07.320]   Um these don't look like games that you die to play, but maybe your mom would I don't know
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.720]   um
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:15.800]   You know they're they're kind of more like casual games, but it's a cloud gaming service. They're joining google and so many others
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.320]   What do you think is meant by the arbitrary policy the 30 cut or
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.000]   You know, I don't think it's the 30 cut because so microsoft
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:33.800]   Uh, they told microsoft with x cloud the problem is they if apple doesn't want anybody to put like anything that looks anything like a store
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.880]   Um or an alternate app store online
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.160]   So microsoft which has x cloud and has a lot of games
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.480]   They said you can do that, but each game has to be a separate app
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.440]   You can't have a picker
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.800]   An x cloud picker that says what game do you want to play?
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.440]   That's nuts. I mean you'd steam
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:01.320]   If yeah, they don't want steam or epic to have a store but it but it but microsoft and i'm sure facebook's position is
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.960]   This is these are streaming games. This is like netflix
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.920]   This would be like saying if you want stranger things on netflix
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:11.880]   You have to have a stranger things app and if you wanted to watch the office on netflix
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.800]   You had to have a office app that's nuts
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.960]   It's just a streaming gaming service and I agree with them. They are arbitrary
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.720]   And this is one of the things apple is being investigated for frankly
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.720]   um
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:27.000]   I this is one of the anti trust complaints that the the house had
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.120]   Europe is investigating them right now for this as well. So
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.520]   Just wait till they start a search engine. That's the latest. Oh, yeah
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.080]   That's the latest
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   So I believe I saw I hit line when someone said that uh apple is looking at starting a search engine and it's
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.280]   Probably going to be the worst thing to happen to apple users
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:55.160]   So this came from the finance right right? Yeah, remember apple man. This this came from the financial times with unnamed sources
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.800]   um
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.680]   So
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.680]   It actually ties back to
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.400]   Again, this house report one of the things they dinged
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.960]   Google for is paying
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:12.360]   Companies to have google search on the platform. It's estimated they pay apple seven between seven and 12 billion
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   dollars a year
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:23.080]   To have it be the default search sounds like a terrible monopolist taking advantage. Yeah, no, that's just uh, that's just good competition
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:30.360]   Well, no one else could do it obviously I offered to pay six billion and but they opened me
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.880]   There's a picture of tim cook and sundar pachai. This was a three years ago
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.600]   Uh eating a vietnamese food in palo alto together
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.600]   All the picked up the check. I love this
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.560]   All right, and there's probably neither one of them paid
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.520]   No, who knows? I don't know
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.120]   Um neither one of them paid, but this was apparently when there was some
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.800]   You know difficulty getting a deal between google and apple
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:03.720]   You know, but but this is a lot of money for apple. This is the the lion's share of their services revenue
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.960]   Uh, so they needed the money and google really needs those eyeballs
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.840]   So they made a deal they were uh the restaurant
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:19.480]   Yeah, the restaurant in case you're interested is was you'd like to go there and enjoy the same vietnamese food
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:25.240]   Is called tamarind tamarind in palo alto. It's good. It looks good
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.040]   Let's go
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.920]   That's a still thing they got those meals for free. That's pretty sure that's sad to cook made when
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:37.000]   When sundar pachai wrote a number on a piece of paper and slid it across the table
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.800]   Oh
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:43.240]   Just add a zero and do another's good. Yeah one more zero
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:51.160]   Uh, you know, I don't think if apple does a search engine it would be a google
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.960]   We've talked about this on windows weekly. I don't think it'd be a google style
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.400]   Uh
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:59.320]   Keyword search for web page even google's moving away from that now
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.320]   When you do a google search half the time you get a knowledge graph you get the answer your question apple knows
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.600]   That's really what people want especially because most of the time this will be voice-based
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.840]   They want siri to say something yeah, and they don't want it to always be google
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.040]   So right now apple cobbles together a bunch of services
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:22.520]   Um, you know, wick you'll get a wicki pd answer sometimes sometimes you'll get a google answer sometimes you'll get a um
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.640]   an answer from
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.200]   Uh, oh, what is that wolfram alpha wolfram? Yeah, so I think or quora or quora. Yeah
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:38.840]   So I think it's not unreasonable to think that apple is doing that but especially since they hired john gendren gnn gnn dender
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.320]   You know how i'm talking about say your name
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.080]   john g
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080]   john g we call him
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.160]   john gendrea
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.640]   Uh, the search guy from google went to apple
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.520]   um
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:55.880]   Like a year ago two years ago
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.120]   He created meta web and free base
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:04.520]   He led google search and artificial intelligence joined apple as a senior executive in 2018
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:13.480]   senior vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence strategy at apple that was a big a big get
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:18.360]   Uh, with all of that in place. Do you feel apple can pull this off?
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.760]   Yeah
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.880]   Yeah, I don't think it's like maps. I don't think it's like maps at all
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.480]   uh
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   maps required
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.920]   A lot of real world data gathering driving cars around
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:38.440]   Uh, um, and they acquired mapping information from a bunch of companies cobbled it together. I think apple
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.280]   It is more like machine learning and ai I think apple
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.280]   Can say look there's a lot of resources out there including google
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.400]   But syri should give you the right answer
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.280]   You know, what's the worst thing syri does? I don't know if you guys use i don't think any of you's iphones
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.680]   But no sir, but when you use syri the worst thing everybody knows it has an iphone knows it is
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:04.520]   Let me see what I found on the web for you. Here's what I found on the internet. It's the worst
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:10.680]   Assistant doesn't yeah, that's the that's the wrong answer right isn't that all right matthew? That's where you go
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.800]   Incredibly infuriating. Yeah, I could have done. Yeah. What what you want is an answer
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:22.120]   And uh, well publishers get mad about is when they give you an answer. Yes, that's right because you're not
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:27.480]   It'll be interesting. I think it so imagine apple does do that you've got this massive massive company
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:33.000]   That that controls a huge proportion of the sort of mobile device
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.120]   base and and an app store and
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:41.720]   30 percent and all that other stuff and now they're launching a search engine is that good is that
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   Competitive or is it going to be just another thing?
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.200]   You know that they're going to control that's makes it anti-competitive
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.640]   Well, and I also should point out there's this financial times report is
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.560]   Kind of speculative. I don't know if I don't know how well let's
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.600]   Let's change that name. I change apple out
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:08.760]   With sam song is this news if sam song was doing this, you know, yeah, we'll say some fail of resources. They tried already, right?
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.320]   right xp
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.240]   Huawei probably is doing it. Yeah, they have to
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:20.200]   I mean there's other players out there with deep pockets and a lot of resources that
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.840]   I just don't see why apple is making all of the news
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:29.400]   But I guess it's because they have a gazillion handsets out there. That's right. In fact, they just
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.600]   According to one analyst crossed a billion active
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.600]   phones one billion active and I think they have like
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.360]   600 billion dollars in cash or something
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:45.480]   Huge cash. Oh, yeah, but see I see I think people think when they read that article
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.120]   Oh, they're going to do a google clone and I don't think anybody's going to ever do a google clone
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.520]   No, I think that's done
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.600]   Right google owns that
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.120]   Facebook has searched but it's based on your social graph
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.600]   It's always been often just and it's terrible. It's terrible
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.040]   Twitter maybe could do a better job than they're doing
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.960]   They don't they put no energy in a what would what would the next? I mean, okay, but so I've talked about about
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.360]   Subir Aurora and sage
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:17.000]   I think there's a next generation of search
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.680]   What samir is working on is expert based network. Yes
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.960]   Um, I think that that's that's that you don't you want everything you want everything in the world?
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.000]   Fine. Yeah, go to google. It's there right, but we're going to give you
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.440]   Some sense of the best now how the hell you do that
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.600]   Questions and you're gonna have Ted Cruz yelling at you when the New York Post isn't included in the best
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.240]   But we'll cross that version we come to it
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.320]   But I think that there's there's there's a next for everything there is on the net
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.240]   This is the post I wrote today about totalitarianism and journalism
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.960]   Um, but for everything there's a next generation
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:56.440]   Right what Facebook and twitter do is help everybody speak and I celebrate that but it doesn't really help everybody listen
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.760]   It doesn't tell you what's worth listening to
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.640]   What Facebook does is connect you with somebody you already know so you can share stuff, but it doesn't really create communities
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.600]   Not really uh, it doesn't doesn't introduce us to strangers
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.880]   There's a next generation of everything we see them and that waiting to happen
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:13.960]   So does apple have the imagination to think what search could be?
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.320]   I doubt
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.800]   Yeah, I don't know
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:25.480]   When you can you give me an example of this network you're talking, uh, like network of experts
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.840]   so, um
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.160]   Sage started with
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.520]   um
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.920]   Not maybe the best timing for this part of it, but they started with
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.240]   Travel restaurants and hotels and destinations because it's a very set
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.320]   um
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.920]   Taxonomy of
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.760]   entities, right you know, that's a restaurant for sure then they started with a
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:53.320]   100 handpicked people that they said these are our experts and then they went to the next
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.840]   Network out from there and said who who are they linking to who's in theirs?
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.560]   And then out from there till I got to certain numbers where where you know
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.680]   It's gonna fall apart at a certain point, but they found they they could scale the quality of the information they were getting
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.440]   For these entities for these hotels restaurants resorts and so on
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.440]   Um, uh, really well by starting with a core set of experts
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:17.720]   So I I talked to samir and I said well, I've got a core set of of coven experts for you
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.920]   You know, I wish you do the same thing there where I have in right there in my lower third
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.720]   600 some epidemiologists virologists, etc
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:31.880]   Uh, you could imagine starting there with the people you trust and then see what the network comes out from there
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.680]   Then what do you come back with when you come back with the things that they're writing that they're linking to
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.600]   Um that they say now what's what samir is doing with sage?
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:46.040]   He's also building a structure for creators to create homes for themselves on the net
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:50.520]   Which gives them something nice to do and gives them a lot of different business models for that
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:56.520]   But it also gives them an opportunity for them to find a place to say oh, I'm an expert and I like this and this and this and this
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.280]   Mm-hmm. Um, so it's interesting to if you get past something that has a
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:06.120]   Travel has a clear set of entities medicine has a clear set of credentials
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:10.040]   You get into other areas. What is expertise being in politics?
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.920]   And eight political reporters will take that for damn sure
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:20.200]   Um, what does expertise being in technology? Well, maybe you could you could say who really knows their stuff
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.560]   I don't know or it could be fact-based eliminate the opinions. I mean
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:31.400]   Oh really what google does is search for web pages right now. Yeah, uh, obviously that's not something you're going to try to beat
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:35.560]   Uh, but I think it's often the case especially with voice assistance
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:41.080]   That you are not searching for a web page because it's nothing to click you're searching for an answer
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:46.520]   Answers and that doesn't mean I guess you could say, you know, what's the best smartphone?
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.240]   But I don't think that's a great
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.560]   I think that's so subjective
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.560]   That I just don't I don't know if that's a great one happens. I ask google that
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:02.920]   Well, they probably sense so I do some sort of cutesy thing with tech radar best phones in the us
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:09.240]   T3 best phones 20 right so they anybody you know looks at that goes well. Yeah, that's somebody's opinion
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:15.080]   That's not the best phone. So I don't wouldn't expect apple to put a lot of energy into that, but if you said what?
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:23.320]   What's the what is the spec for you know, what processor does a phone use or how much is the iPhone or how much is a pixel?
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.960]   That's the kind of thing
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:31.160]   People that you can give a concrete answer to I would expect that frankly, that's what I would want siri to give me
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:37.000]   That's always what we want when we ask series something and I think everybody's looking all these companies are looking at the future
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.920]   You know, it's not going to be typing into no a device. Don't reinvent the web search engine
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:49.400]   That's been done. Even google didn't think that was the future. That's why they did google plus they were hoping to find something else
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.440]   Didn't quite work
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.920]   I'm a little fascinated that I asked yeah, it's a good question. I'm glad you brought it up
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:02.280]   Fascinating that I asked um google assistant, you know, what's the best smartphone?
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.960]   And it pulls up a Samsung s25 g ads
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:14.200]   On my pixel. Well, that's another reason why your information source should not be ad supported like that
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.800]   That's another advantage apple could have they make money on the phones
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:22.600]   Uh-huh because they failed to advertise it so they turn that into a feature. Okay, but they did and it's done
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.480]   I'm just bringing that up. I don't
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.040]   Know
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.040]   To presume apples great
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:36.360]   No, they're a business and they pivoted and they said well if that's not gonna work what else could we do?
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.720]   Oh, we could really be the privacy gurus
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:44.200]   Whether they are not
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.800]   All right, I would expect the same thing would happen with google
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.800]   We we can't we're not going to be this search engine for web pages
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:56.280]   But but but that's not what we need to do we need series should be smarter and better
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.480]   And if you're gonna make series smarter and better, you're gonna come up with better answers
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:02.920]   Well, another way to look at it is the old where we talked in the old days you want agents
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:06.200]   Right for that kind of question. I'm gonna go here for that kind of question
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.680]   I'm gonna go there and I'm gonna know where to go to do that
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.440]   I guess you could say there's a metal layer
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:16.280]   What is tech radar think the best smartphone would be that would be a reasonable question or or
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.120]   Yeah, or who has the best recommendations for what is the answer?
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:25.800]   Is the best DSLR that would be a more targeted. Yeah more specific
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.240]   What does a poor think the best coffee machines? We know that
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.680]   My love safter mine
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:39.240]   Dad gum bremeter it the twiggy side studios that I still haven't quite gotten off an account or yet
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:43.560]   I'm gonna give it to you and if anybody has the muscles to do it you do it
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:46.280]   Maybe maybe the muscle is it's the
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.120]   Obscuring it and getting it out of there without the camera seeing
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.920]   cameras
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:59.560]   Everywhere speaking of which here is a picture on twitter of mark succerberg if he had jack dorson spirit
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:06.200]   So why couldn't we have a series of why couldn't he connect what was happening with zuck?
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.080]   Yeah, you know, he's probably in Hawaii
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:13.160]   They pretend they get him online the hour that I watched
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.440]   Then he wasn't on and he couldn't connect
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:21.560]   Yeah, you'd think
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:28.200]   If anybody would have a good connection. Yeah, yeah that guy speaking of which maybe you should talk to elan musk because
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:35.240]   Starlink invites are starting to go out. I did. Did you apply for why you're in the north the one more north? I didn't like good
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.280]   I applied and did you get an invite?
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.640]   I have not yet. I haven't checked my email in a while, but I would check your email
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.040]   Apparently they're offering it is 500 for the dish
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.080]   the hardware there's a router all the
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:58.200]   Hardware that's pretty good $99 a month, which is pricey, but you're gonna get you know bandwidth speed though
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.720]   You know people are reporting
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:08.200]   Not great speeds like anywhere between I think it was 20 and 50 megabits down
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.920]   But the latency is
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.840]   Yes, well they're not all up. Do you give me a break is only 900 satellites up there?
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:24.120]   They don't starlink doesn't say expect to see i'm sorry
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.200]   Starlink says
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:33.320]   Expect to see data speeds vary from 50 to 150 megabits latency from 20 to 40 milliseconds
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.920]   Over the next several months and there will be a good or bad latency
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.040]   That's not great. It's but for satellite it's actually good, but it's not yeah for
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.160]   Enough for the show
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.840]   There'll be brief periods of no connectivity all but they only have 900 of the 12 000 satellites up
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:57.560]   So they're not even 10 percent there and it presumably gets I think it gets i've heard it gets better as they get more satellites
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:06.040]   Yes, you have 10 see and up at the cabin up at the lake. What's your internet up there 10 10 see this would be
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.840]   Actually right now i'm using my phone
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:14.120]   How much you getting there
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:18.520]   I'm getting about 40 or 50 I think if I um
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:22.040]   If I could buy it, I would
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.000]   partly to test it
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.240]   Yeah, I'd love to test it also as a backup. I get gigabit speeds from my cable provider elon give me a call
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:34.360]   Your area is not included Leo
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:39.800]   Uh, I can't remember if I asked for an invite to be honest with you. It was a while. It was like last spring
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:45.640]   Where do you ask? Well, it was on the star link page is over now. Yeah, but you have to be in the northern
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:49.800]   United States or Canada. So that's why you got an invite Matthew because you're in Ontario. So
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.960]   um
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.640]   Yeah, I don't know
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.040]   Should we just not mention elon's recent tweets. We just pretend those didn't happen
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.240]   Oh, I missed that's always a good part of the show. I don't even want to show them. They're so
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.240]   embarrassingly bad
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.480]   Um
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.480]   I'll tell you what I'll put up on the screen
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:14.200]   You guys can look at it for those of you listening you won't be offended, but you will hear the groans
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.160]   For those of you watching video close your eyes
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:22.440]   This is those are the tweets. There's this first one jack in the box. Oh, no
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:25.880]   Okay, and then a couple of quick jokes
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:30.120]   No, no, no, no, no
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:35.000]   Audio people we've done you a favor. Oh, just oh just be gone. Oh, yeah
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.880]   Thanks a lot. We all what's wrong with what you have to do that because
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.760]   What do we got?
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.600]   Is there a respected and established ceo of not one
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:49.960]   But two important companies spacex and tesla and he's clearly
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:57.160]   He's not he's clearly wanted a regular human. He's a regular human. That's the kind of joke you expect from an eight year old
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.960]   Maybe not an eight year old. He's a child. He's a child
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.200]   Maybe he was into the engine again. You never know. I think he was into something
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.000]   Anyway, I probably should have even mentioned it
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.760]   At least this won't get him a gigantic fine from the SEC. No, it does not gonna it's not gonna
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.240]   It's not a forward looking statement. Well, it kind of is
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:22.920]   Could be market moving here and
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:30.120]   Guys, I would never have done this had Stacy been here. It's it was one of those rude jokes that no woman should ever have to see
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.320]   Um
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:35.880]   Do you want to talk most Jeffrey tooping?
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.040]   No
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.680]   We did. Do you have anything to add to the story?
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:47.000]   No, it's just thinking of bad jokes. Yeah, it seems related somehow
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.200]   Mm
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.240]   We have here. Uh, this is a good hallowing costume
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.040]   Yeah, I like this one. Yeah
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.400]   He's going as a zoom meeting with a bunch of monsters
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:05.560]   He made it for his daughter daughters. Oh, his daughter's gonna wear it
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:12.360]   So it's a printout of a zoom. It says zoom and gloom meeting and it's got the invisible man
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.760]   next victim
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   Creature from the black lagoon wolf man
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:20.680]   Frankenstein a witch, but I think they're all family members
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:27.080]   But there's a real screen too. There's a video if it's is the one I's put up is a video. Yeah. Oh, there's a video of it
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.080]   Let me see. Yeah, this is from CNN
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.120]   I think it's up there
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:39.160]   Did you got to worry about 25 ads? Here's the tweet fascinating. Here's the tweet. Here's the tweet show this. Oh, wait a minute. Let me go back
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:44.760]   Oh, and I get it. There's a cutout
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:49.160]   But they're all bit is a screen. Oh, they're all videos. Oh my god
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.840]   No, only the top is the top is the camera of the person
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:59.320]   So that's you and it says next victim. Oh, I get it
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:05.800]   And in the middle the masked murderer is the actual trick or treater. That is so clever. That's pretty cool
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.000]   Next
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.760]   I love it. Greg Dietzenbach
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:13.720]   nice job
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.680]   on the halloween costume. Greg you need to go back to the office
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.560]   I wish I was
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   Someone posted a display that they had outside the house and there's a skeleton
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:28.680]   Had a computer with a video screen and all the boxes have skeletons
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.840]   We've never ended the never ending zoom meeting
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:40.600]   Today today is one of my 11 hour days
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:46.600]   It's somehow strange by years because why I switched to headphones my ears are absolutely killing me
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.360]   Headphones those looking came out of a cereal box. Where'd you get
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:41:02.440]   I got it when I went to Mexico for some event and they gave them away and they're not bad headphones
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.960]   Yeah, they say Google. I hope this is not seen as a terrible comprehensive address here
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:12.840]   But they're more comfortable than the others. There is a you were right. You know what you you said a tick-tock would be the source of some
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.120]   information
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.000]   There is a super pack on tick-tock
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:26.680]   Does it's called meme pack run by teens hoping to influence young voters against Donald Trump
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:33.800]   Isn't that clever me? It's a yeah, it's meme pack run by 17 18 and 19 year olds
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:40.360]   It's big their account on tick-tock is bigger than the Lincoln projects account
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.400]   So the Lincoln projects gonna start a media company if you were following that
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:49.480]   You know, I have mixed feelings about that whole thing. Yeah, I do too
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.640]   Matthew do you know what they're gonna do?
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:00.120]   Uh, it sounds like they're gonna try and do a bunch of different types of media podcasts and
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:04.200]   Stuff like that. It wasn't clear. Everybody's doing podcasts now
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:10.360]   If I hear they're gonna be big I hear there. I gotta find a new medium. I can't audible and ask
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:16.360]   Audible it outs to 100,000 podcasts. We looked into it when they when they were when they started doing this
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.600]   But they said you can't have any ads in your podcast. It's like well. What good is that?
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:26.680]   How am I supposed to mod it? I'm just gonna give you content and that's that
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.200]   So
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.200]   Anyway, we're not part of that
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.160]   The uh the Amazon scam I put in here
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.960]   Uh, no tell us all about it. Well line 68
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.720]   And uh, uh, 100,000 dollar scam
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:46.520]   making money
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:53.640]   This takes a lot of effort. So, uh, deputy arrested a florida woman, of course
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:59.720]   Of course, uh, a fraudulent return scheme involving dozens of amazon accounts and thousands of returned items
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:03.080]   between march 2015 and august 2020
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:08.760]   She reused prepaid shipping labels generated for cancelled orders
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:15.320]   And then applied them on other returns making it appear she had paid for her own shipping costs
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:23.160]   When she actually did not she did get ready for this talk about ambitious 42,000
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.200]   individual returns
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.000]   And she made she got a hundred thousand dollars reimbursed, but that's over a five-year period
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.120]   That's barely I mean it's barely enough to live on
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.640]   So she's arrested
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:44.520]   Wow florida woman came up with a barely tenable scam
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.000]   I was like the cost of the boxes. Yeah
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:56.120]   42,000 items over a five-year period. That's 8,000 a year
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:05.640]   That's I got like six things over here and I feel all claustrophobic just from six boxes sitting there 42,000
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.560]   8,000 return how many it
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.560]   What is 8,000 divided by 365?
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:22.440]   It's 21 21 returns a day every day all year for five years
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.120]   What did she draw a ten full-time job?
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.760]   And she bet she got 20,000 a year
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:33.640]   Uh
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.920]   Sometimes this scam is just not worth the effort. No
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.240]   No, that's really struck me
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.960]   Uh
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.840]   Let's see let's take a all right. I want to make sure we get everything in here anything else we have
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:49.640]   You guys are desperate to cover
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:53.560]   Have we done it, you know, oh, we haven't done that I have to do that. Yeah
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.160]   uh
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.640]   I you know, I haven't covered the zoom deleting events
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.320]   about zoom censorship because it's like
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.080]   Fine use google me instead
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.240]   Why would you use zoom to talk about zoom censorship? Come on
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:12.760]   Uh
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:15.640]   Yeah, let's do the let's do the the thing
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:19.480]   The google change log
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.920]   Yep, but it
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.920]   the boom
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.480]   New stuff from google google temporarily limits purchased movie playback on the web
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:35.480]   to what 480p with youtube this is according to android police
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:42.120]   Uh, remember they did slow down streaming in the covid crisis first began because they were worried about killing
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.960]   bandwidth
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:48.760]   Uh, this says at this point that they said it's uh, it's a technical issue
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:57.480]   And they will apparently fix it. So as really I'm noticing this behavior on just regular youtube videos on mobile by default
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.480]   popping up at 480
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:04.760]   Uh, whether i'm here in the home or out and then and i'll just have to flip it and toggle it
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:07.880]   Yeah, that's okay. No one wants 480 anymore
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:12.920]   YouTube music and android auto adds a playlist button that lets
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.840]   Free users play songs that they have uploaded
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.960]   There it is. That's a big picture of the button
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.880]   I don't know if that's a
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:27.640]   That's a video that's not playing remember google's loon
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.440]   The loon project
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.160]   Those are the balloons that they sent it as stratosphere to provide internet access
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.080]   to uh people
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.160]   alphabets loon set a new record for the longest stratospheric flight
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:46.600]   Their loon balloons circumnavigated the globe except for some weird little
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:52.280]   Uh movement down here in the uh in the pacific off central america
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:55.240]   It's really not that's not what you want
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:05.960]   You really stayed aloft for 312 days 200 of them spent just wandering aimlessly in the uh in the central pacific
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.720]   Waiting for the election of your what's this going on here over Ecuador? It's just like
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.920]   I don't know it looks like so it started from uh
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:21.800]   Started from the caribbean went to equidore went back and forth a bunch of times and said okay i'm moving
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:24.280]   Went along around
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.040]   Covering no ground so no one could get yeah most of this was over the ocean
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.520]   So there's no internet unless you're in a little sailboat or something
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:34.760]   Yeah, really there's very little ground stuff. This was kind of a waste of time
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.320]   It launched in Puerto Rico headed to peru not equidore
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.200]   Uh, oh they kept it in peru I guess they controlled a little bit it provided three months of test internet and then uh went
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:49.000]   all over the place
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.680]   uh
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:53.480]   alphabet said it hit the milestone through a combination
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.940]   of design
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.640]   Material science
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.520]   Manufacturing and just damn luck though. I had that
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:06.680]   I don't they must have a way of steering that thing that's interesting
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.760]   Uh, this is not the greatest changelog ever
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.720]   Uh, we will wrap it up with this
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.680]   new 3d animals
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.160]   For halloween do you use the google augmented reality?
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   Well now you can get a skeleton
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.520]   a halloween ghost in your shower
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:31.240]   Or put a hat on your cat or maybe that cat's part of the deal. I don't know
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.600]   Actually, I think the whole thing is uh, augmented reality
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.520]   so
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.520]   Yeah, black. Yeah

[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:00.760]   You have the option view in your space take a picture
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.520]   So oh I get it so search for black cat and then you'll get a
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:10.200]   3d view of a black cat or search for a german shepherd you'll say well, this is one of the
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.040]   dullest
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:15.480]   changelog is that even so you're stretching it up and that's

[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.920]   Not even fighting words, right?
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.840]   Oh, not even close. I mean they're both chicken technically
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:52:02.040]   If we can buy this more chicken than kfc is at least at least pop eyes says chicken
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.360]   What makes it better what makes it better?
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.320]   Just has more flavor, I think
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.080]   Yeah, a lot more it's got 12
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.800]   It's actually southern fried and flaky
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.520]   Yeah, crispy
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:17.720]   Yeah, have you had the sandwich yet? Did you did you get the sandwich ever the sandwich was overrated
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:23.160]   Just rather have the yeah the regular fried chicken on their sandwich. I'm going to lay the

[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:33.400]   Oh, yeah, and then you get biscuits the biscuits. Oh, I'm
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:39.560]   So it's real southern food. It's good. You're cooking and and you certify it. It's it's it's worth
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.640]   it's actually
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.640]   We go there probably twice a month
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:49.240]   So yeah, four thighs two biscuits. That's how I roll actually I think that's how we got it to move out here
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.800]   We said there's a pop eyes out. That's it
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:56.600]   That was one of her me. Don't have clumps in football, but you had pop eyes
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:09.240]   Anything else we missed the chat room is is nominating. Thank you scooter x
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:16.440]   This story. I bought some time ago a great dash cam and had a camera facing me and if camera facing out
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:21.400]   It had all these nice services a little more expensive, but it came with built-in cellular service
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:25.640]   It was called the owl cam and I told everybody to get it and then
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.080]   They just folded at the beginning of the year
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:34.280]   I think because of covid but they just disappeared from the face of the earth they got purchased
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:40.280]   By a company called zirgo technologies, which sounds like a fake legit
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:46.840]   So like the kind of like the evil villain in a flash gordon movie
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:51.880]   zirgo, which is a leading provider of industrial IOT solutions
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.640]   Apparently is bringing the owl cam back
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:08.360]   The company called call pass, which does GPS and asset tracking integration says we're taking over the owl cam brand from zirgo
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.200]   And um, if you now I have an owl cam
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.760]   I'm hoping
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:18.520]   I'm hoping that uh, this will it will suddenly come to life again
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.480]   Um, yeah, they said uh, approximately 40 percent of existing
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:29.640]   Owl cam owners have already purchased our new owl cam plus plan. I'm going to get online and do it
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:36.360]   Uh, you have to pay for your lte service now, but that makes sense. That's one of the reasons they went out business the free lte
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:42.120]   Uh, we're committed to providing the best possible continuity of service and experience that we can
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.800]   frankly
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:50.760]   Jason ashton ceo of cal pass said most people don't care who's in charge. They just want the damn thing to work
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.280]   Uh, yeah, yeah, so yeah, so I will um
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:59.800]   And zirgo is going to continue making the owl cam
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:08.040]   So if you go to owl cam dot com you can revive your owl cam
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:14.600]   Yay, and there's no like nsa backdoors in there or anything. Oh, who cares? It's just the street and me
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.040]   It was fun. One of the things I liked about it is you could communicate with it from anywhere
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:22.680]   So I could scare people who are driving my car
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:30.840]   And then I have a great video of them crashing so uh, that was lots of fun
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:35.560]   Um, so yeah, that's how you print. I hope I didn't I might it you know what
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:41.080]   Do you remember seeing it at the last leo's garage sale aunt? I think I put it on the table
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.120]   I think that's why it sounded familiar to me. I think i'm
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.520]   Did you would you snag it?
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:50.360]   When I did that, but I'll when you said owl cam, I was like, why does this sound familiar?
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.640]   Burke, did you snag the owl cam who got the owl cam
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:56:01.640]   It was not there says berg. So maybe I saved it. Maybe I had high hopes that someday it would be reactivated
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:08.360]   Anything else
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:11.960]   Anything else I think it's a good time for us to do our last day to get you guys ready
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.360]   for your picks
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.360]   of the
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.440]   week
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:21.480]   Our show today brought to you by wasabi
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:26.680]   Hot cloud storage not the green ball next to your sushi. That's wasabi
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:33.400]   Uh horseradish. This is wasabi hot cloud storage spelled the same, but it's a very different thing
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:39.160]   It is cloud, but it's cloud done right. It's one fifth the cost of amazon's s3
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.600]   Significantly it's so affordable signal
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.480]   It's faster than s3 uses the s3 api, but because it's so affordable
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.440]   It's actually less expensive than buying hard drives on premises
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:59.160]   In fact wasabi so affordable you can you can store data in there cloud for less than just the annual maintenance fees
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:02.600]   On the same amount of on-prem storage. That's amazing
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.720]   And I have to say it is safer. It is better in every way than on-prem storage
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.240]   So if you're a company that's generating data on a consistent basis like we are like a lot of companies are
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:20.440]   Don't buy more hard drives. Don't buy storage as uh saans. Don't buy don't buy nasses just
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.680]   Check out wasabi 11 nines of durability
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:29.960]   That means on average you you might lose one file every 649,000 years
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.680]   Check back with me in 649,000 years
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.640]   Let me know because I don't think you're gonna lose any data because here's what they do
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:42.440]   They have active integrity checking where all the objects you store on massabi are checked every 90 days at least
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:48.440]   They're hosted in premier tier four data center facilities that are not only highly secure. They're fully redundant
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:54.040]   So if any time any data seems like it's been changed. They've got a copy on another tier four center
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:56.200]   They can get it and your data is secure
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:01.480]   It's encrypted by default even if you don't specify it because of course that's the right way to do things
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.240]   They follow all the industries best security models and design practices
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:09.320]   Access control mechanisms like a buckle policies and access controllers
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:13.080]   My favorite part is you can designate data as immutable
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:19.320]   That means it cannot be erased or altered not by ransom. We're not by fumble fingered employees
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:21.560]   Not by you
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.120]   You have to go through jump through some hoops to modify it
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:29.640]   That means you could put your data on on massabi and know that it's secure and safe and will not be encrypted
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:36.120]   It would by malware will you know, I mean this is awesome hip-up FINRA CJIS compliant now come on
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:40.040]   Tell me that's better in every respect that on-prem storage
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:46.840]   And you know while the cost is very low I can make it even more affordable you could pay as you go. A lot of people do that
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:51.720]   But they also offer something called reserved capacity storage
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:57.000]   If you know ahead of time as most people do we're going to need this much storage over the next few years
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:02.040]   You can buy or reserve capacity ahead of time in one three or five year increments
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.280]   You save more the more capacity and the longer the term
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:12.920]   So you can bring the cost down even lower and wasabi unlike s3 never charges for egress
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:20.440]   They have the s3 api completely compatible, but they don't charge for api requests. They don't have all those crazy storage tiers
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.640]   It's just
[01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:25.880]   Highly secure disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ears
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:30.840]   Storage it's 80 percent cheaper and up to six times faster than the industry leader
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:33.240]   You look just do yourself a favor
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:38.360]   If you're shopping around calculate the savings for yourself, you can actually bang on it for a while
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:41.160]   See if it works with all your s3 compatible tools
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:45.320]   It will start a free trial of storage for a month go to wasabi.com

[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:21.560]   Ant's got a number. I like it. Ant you want to start with your number of the week hey hey competition
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.960]   Yeah
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:28.040]   I wrote that in there
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:31.080]   Specifically just a strike at nerve with mr. Jarvis
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.520]   What is your number of the week?
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:40.680]   My number is 92 and it is a shout out to the awesome mr.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.680]   Louis Hamilton
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:46.360]   I'm not going to talk sports ball, but I am going to talk sports just briefly
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.520]   mr. Leonard
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:54.520]   Louis Hamilton now has the record for most victories in formula one
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.480]   Passing my cool shoemaker
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.520]   I used to watch for f1 back in the late 90s and then I just sort of got out of it and
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:08.840]   Recently started picking it back up again at their chatting with mr. Ian Thompson twit twit guest and uh
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:14.360]   and uh some some other folks and just watching luiz Hamilton has been great to see
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:21.160]   his uh superior performance on the track and he is now the all-time leader in victories
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:25.640]   But it also made me think about some other things if you look at the second link there
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:27.240]   um
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.080]   he was uh
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:34.920]   You know people didn't particularly care for the fact that he now has the record and has some snide comments and
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:40.280]   Then of course they come back and say I apologize for saying that yada yada yada. He's got the best car
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:44.200]   So that's why he won all the races when in actuality
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:48.120]   There's a couple other Mercedes cars out there in the same tracks just as he is
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:54.440]   But he still went in the races. So why not just give that man his credit when credit is due. Oh, there's one thing you left out
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.240]   Mm-hmm. He's african-american
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:59.480]   I was getting there
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:05.320]   That is not what you think of in in f1 racing, right? That's right. Good for him
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:07.400]   Made me think about
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:11.480]   Back in uh, I think it was the late 90s. Excuse me when mr
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:14.600]   Tiger Woods was just on a tear in the pga
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:19.000]   And a man named fuzzy zeller decided to throw some races
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.680]   remarks out there because he was just kicking ass and
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:25.400]   Like really just give the man his do he earned it?
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.840]   um
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:32.280]   So yeah, it's nice to see that he's doing this thing here in f1 and uh continuing to
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.640]   To fly the flag for equality and social social justice for everyone
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.160]   Um
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:44.920]   F1 did stop him from wearing his t-shirts when he gets on the podium because he's on the podium every week
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.720]   Um f1 did pretty impressive
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:51.960]   You know, you can't be wearing a t-shirt. She need to be wearing your racing suit
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:58.280]   So he still will wear his mask that says black lives matter when he gets on the podium each and every sunday
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:04.840]   What is he from america? Is he american? No, he's british british so he's not african american. He's african british
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:07.880]   British black let's just say that black man black man
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:12.680]   That's all it needs to be said good for him good 92 was the number mr
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.480]   Jarvis is are you okay with that or well, that's a good number yours from now on that's a
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:20.120]   Don't do that. It's like mr
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.120]   Pie now you got it. It's yours
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.360]   What's your what's your number jeff?
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:33.320]   Uh, well, I have a deli it's not great. It's good though. It's just out shown me. It's not problem
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:38.120]   So deli has a survey of privacy stuff. They do on a regular basis
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:47.320]   Just one or two numbers from it. The average number of smart devices per person has increased since 2015 from 3.8 to 6.2
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.080]   That doesn't seem like that minor for that
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:56.840]   Isn't I great but six six is a lot. I mean because I'm surprised it was 3.8 in 2015
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:59.000]   I mean it really was just your smart phone, but now
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.800]   I mean there are a lot of devices here any anybody's got smart anything iot
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:07.560]   I have I have 59
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:11.000]   Devices i'm not kidding on my network
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.680]   And only a half you know, I was gonna do the thing where you stacey talks about where you have a vlan
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.800]   For your smart for your computers. Yep
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:26.280]   And a vlan for your it devices and I realized the vlan computers like have five things on everything else
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:29.000]   Is an iot device
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.760]   So I just didn't do it. I would have 50 iot devices probably in the house 50
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.760]   She's
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.760]   I know so smart speaker
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:45.240]   Access so there's five years as a reach from zero percent of course in 2015 to now 29 percent
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.400]   Wow
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:50.440]   Was zero in 2015 yeah, that's what i did
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:55.400]   I had my sonos in 20. Oh, they're talking about things like echo and okay. Okay. Yeah, you know
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:57.560]   It was a dumb expensive overpriced
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:02.360]   That was a huge money find it but i was like okay. You're right. You're right. It was everything
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:07.080]   But you're the smart about it reveals you should have enough to buy it. They were smart to sell it to me. Yeah
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.960]   Okay
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:16.360]   Access to smart TVs and I would have thought this would have been more like like smart speakers, but no it was 24 percent in 2015 now it's 58 percent
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:21.640]   Yeah, I actually honestly wish I could buy a dumb tv. I don't want any all that software my
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:27.640]   I know I can there's my dead services online. I keep an actually hitting the button. I wait till it's so annoying so
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:35.640]   Smart phone ownership increased from 76 percent in 2015 to 91 percent now. We're almost 100 percent. Wow almost there
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.400]   uh
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:40.840]   And then um in the uk so it's uk and they're different
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:47.800]   But users have become less concerned about the use of their private privacy of their data in 2018
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:53.480]   47 percent of respondents stated they were very concerned now that's halved to 24 percent
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:56.280]   They've given up all you privacy nuts out there
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:59.320]   Maybe now you buy my book
[02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:03.000]   That's really interesting. Yeah, I wonder why uk
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:09.080]   Citizens have just given up. I think we're just getting used to it. I mean the list of the ways you're sharing stuff
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:15.480]   It's a lot right you're sharing your your health data and your name and your photos and you know, I guess what I'm going to share a mean to
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.640]   right
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:21.080]   So that's it. That's why I'm not very excited numbers ant wins for the week
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:26.360]   No, I like I like them both. They're both good. No, you're just you're just being a host of a show
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:32.360]   Nice said both good. It's your job would be nice once in a while. Well, as soon as you're not paid anymore
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.360]   Then you stop being nice. I know but
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:42.600]   Uh actually as soon as I don't have the stress and strain and burden of being nice. I'll probably be a lot nicer
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:50.440]   Oh, that may be the case. Yeah, you wonder. I'm forced to wonder. Yeah, what's he really like now that we don't see him on the air anymore?
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.560]   I hear johnny caution turn it to a real bastard
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:59.320]   I'm kidding. Uh matthew ingrum your pick of the week
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:05.320]   Yeah, I have a thing that was in the rundown, um, which I thought was hilarious
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.600]   Uh
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:12.200]   This guy reverse engineered mctonalds. Um, yes the mikflor a pi the ordering a pi
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:17.240]   Yeah, so he ordered 18 000 worth of mikflorries from every
[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:19.960]   Uh mikflorries every
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:26.360]   Yeah, every half hour he orders another 18 he doesn't I had to read the arse technical article
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:31.720]   Completely to understand he doesn't actually check out he doesn't pay for them. Right. He just leaves them in the car
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.840]   To find out whether the machine is asking why?
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:40.440]   Because the worst thing in the world you wouldn't know this mr. chipotle taco bellhead
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:46.840]   But the worst thing in the world is to be craven and mikflorries and a show by mcdonald's and the machines are broken all the time
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.760]   Yeah, oh
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:51.960]   He actually started out he started out ordering 18 000
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:55.000]   worth of florries
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.160]   from
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:58.360]   really
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:00.360]   But he stepped it
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:03.960]   He's ordering a lot. He here's the deal
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:07.320]   To quote my favorite politician. Here's the deal
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:11.640]   7.5 per 6 percent of all
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:15.000]   McFlurry machines in the world are currently broken
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.840]   But it's worse in philly 12 and a half percent
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.800]   Uh, it's better in uh, los angeles
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:27.880]   Is there some places where they just don't break as often none of them in san francisco are broken
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.120]   So somebody pointed out that because of the way he does it
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:37.000]   It could be just that they're not accepting orders for mikflorries at that time
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.160]   Because it doesn't necessarily mean the machine is nobody silly enough in san francisco to order mcflurry probably i say
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:47.240]   There's no artisanal mikflorries and no

[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.200]   Do they have uh, do they have anything else they have coleslaw?
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.960]   Yeah, if you really want that sure go ahead
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:02.040]   I don't go in for vegetables
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:04.920]   I'm gonna tell you my order
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:11.080]   Is you got the sandwich because it's very nice nice mayo on pickles with a nice touch the buns just right?
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.080]   It's crunchy. It's wonderful
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:16.520]   And you get a little side of red beans rice and you get a biscuit just because they're so good
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:19.000]   It doesn't really go with it but you do it anyway, okay
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.200]   Okay, you already have a little bit of a bun on the thing
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.640]   Yeah, I'm with it. I mean, it's got to be thighs and uh, yeah, that's
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.040]   Red beans are okay, but lots of biscuits lots of biscuits. Yes
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:36.280]   See yeah, if you don't get the bun in the sandwich, then you can have more biscuits
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:42.040]   Well, just tell them to give you a sandwich and hold the bread in order biscuits
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.640]   Oh, but the sandwich without the bread probably is not a good idea
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.600]   Right, it's just chicken. Yeah
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:53.560]   It's funny because after the debate last week I had this craving for our bees roast beef
