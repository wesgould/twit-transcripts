[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.440]   Starting with Gina Trapani, who knows the answer is 42.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.280]   I'm smarterware.org.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.960]   She's also the creator of the ThinkUp app and has some news from the ThinkUp apposphere.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   And to do text.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   How's it going?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   It's going great.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.080]   It's also welcome Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   He's back.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.440]   And he wishes he wears Sweden still.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.040]   I had great hearing.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   The Hanging and the Bandwidth.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   Excellent.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   Bandwidth was magnificent.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.760]   And the Bandwidth here in New York City at my university, your tax dollars at work.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   Sucks.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.240]   Well, a lot more people are using it.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.040]   That's really the reason.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.760]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.080]   And his book, Public Parts is available everywhere.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.600]   Joining us now also from searchengineland.com, Danny Sullivan, it's good to have you, Danny.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Good to be back.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   Oh, he's good to talk.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.680]   And actually, it's very timely because you wrote, I thought, a very good article responding
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120]   to Matt Honan's article on Gizmodo about Google.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.520]   So let's kick it off.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   Matt Honan wrote an article in which he said, "Google is now finally evil."
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.800]   In fact, I've been talking about it yesterday.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.040]   I talked about it today on security now.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.600]   I don't know if it's you or he who talk about the genesis of this.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.160]   Paul Boohite, when he was at Google, I think he was employed like 24, did not want to have
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.880]   the traditional...
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   I think it's you.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.320]   It comes from Stephen Levy's book in the place.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   Right.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   That of his book.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.360]   He really hated all those traditional mission statements.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.620]   And there was this get together, Google, in which they were trying to come up with a
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.620]   mission statement.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.760]   So this is quoting Paul from Stephen's book.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   So I suggested something that would make people feel uncomfortable, but also be interesting.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.160]   It popped into my mind that don't be evil would be a catchy and interesting statement.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.960]   And people laughed, but I said, "No, really."
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.600]   The slogan made Stacey Sullivan uncomfortable was so negative.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.360]   When we phrase it, do the right thing or something more positive.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.720]   She asked Marissa and Salar agreed with her, but the geeks, Boohite and Patel wouldn't
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.360]   budge.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.320]   Don't be evil pretty much says it all as far as they were concerned.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.520]   They fought off every attempt to drop it from the list.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.880]   They liked it the way it was.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.480]   Sullivan would say later with a sigh, it was very important to engineering that they would
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.920]   not be like Microsoft.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.120]   They weren't going to be an evil company.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   But then the New York Times quoted you, Danny, in which you said, "I don't think they ever
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.000]   were not evil."
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.360]   So I think the first question is, what does don't be evil even mean?
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.440]   I mean, it is in a typical mission statement because it's a negative.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.640]   It doesn't say what to do, just what not to do.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.000]   And it's not clear what evil means in this context.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.680]   I mean, I think you brought up that, well, when they were saying this, they were competing
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   against search engines that were putting paid results into the search.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.400]   So that's certainly one thing that was evil.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:02.120]   I think that Google and what I would try to explain to my piece had also defined themselves
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.840]   against companies that they did consider to be evil.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.600]   And I think Microsoft to them was especially the big evil, that they looked at that as
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.480]   a company that was going to try to lock people in, that was going to try to keep
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.480]   competitors out.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.200]   And that was going to do things that was in the company's own interest rather than in,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.520]   say, the user's own interest.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.080]   And for a long time, it really did feel like Google thought they were fighting the good
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.480]   fight against the evil being Microsoft.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   But as you say, the problem is when you say don't be evil, it's such a binary thing,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.440]   either you're good or either you're evil.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.560]   And so I when the New York Times piece, when they quoted me, it was like, I started getting
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.200]   these messages from people saying, do you really think Google's evil?
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.400]   And I was quoted as saying, I don't think they were ever not evil.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   What I meant was, I don't think they were ever not evil.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.000]   I don't think they were ever not good.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.640]   I think those are way to not allowing any kind of nuances out there.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.920]   Typical engineers they see as black and white.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.840]   And unlike engineers, there's no definition.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.040]   You know, usually you'd have a spec for evil.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.160]   We need a spec for evil.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   You would.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.600]   And one of the things I talked about in my piece was how when Google decided that they
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.840]   were to go into China, that Eric Schmidt talked about them having to come up with an evil
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   scale to try to decide just how easy it would be to go into China or not, right?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.040]   Which was my response to anybody at Google who was like, how could you say something
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   like that?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.820]   It's like, well, your own CEO says that you guys apparently are evil because you had to
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.120]   figure out an evil scale to decide how evilness or not your thing was.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.080]   And that's how ludicrous the whole thing was.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.640]   If they had said, try to do the right thing or do buy right by the user, they gone with
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.680]   something else.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.760]   You can appreciate, I think, the sentiment that they had or the desire that they had
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.080]   to be doing right.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.480]   But at this point, Google is such a big, normal company, if you will, that it's impossible
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   for them to do things that are not going to impact somebody adversely.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.520]   And then you just have that binary switch.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.640]   And that's why you get what happens, say, this weekend when Matt does a post.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.600]   And it's just been one of any number of posts where people have been saying, oh, now Google's
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.200]   evil because they said they didn't want to be evil.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.360]   So I guess the switch has flipped.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.200]   That's what we're down to in the discussion.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   Right.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   I think you're right.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   And then the risk is that I'm going to come off like fanboy as usual, but I'm going to
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.400]   come down to it.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.240]   I think your view of it, Danny, was nuanced and Matt's wasn't at all nuanced.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.440]   And it had statements like, you know, people don't trust Google now.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.040]   Well, I just saw something today that.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.160]   Well, that came from the Pew Internet study that said three quarters of people don't want
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   search results.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.520]   I described it as really, you know, there are rhetorical statements in there that suddenly
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.440]   just no one trusts Google anymore.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   Right.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.240]   And the way that Pew survey was written.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   I didn't mention Google.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.080]   I asked in my view.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.880]   And it's all in the whole tracking witchcraft.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.920]   It's like, do you, how would you feel if somebody were following you around?
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   Yes or no?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.920]   Right.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   Exactly.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   It's a little, it's a little weighted.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.720]   And then to come out of this and say, well, suddenly now to declare that all people don't
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.880]   trust Google lacks all nuance and it's, you know, he's just discovered that Google needs
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.000]   to personalize to give us a better service.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.800]   And that's what the entire piece comes down to in my mind.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.640]   Gina also had a far more nuanced view of this, which is that, you know, whereas Danny's
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.800]   saying they were never purely good and Gina's saying we shouldn't give them, you know,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.320]   assume that they're not going to be worth watching.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.000]   They should be watched over.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.400]   And I think that's all true.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:32.760]   But at the same time, one more point, I'm sorry if I get his name, but my friend whose
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.320]   book is up there and I'll remember it in a second, says that the cost of doing evil,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   the cost of doing bad by your customers and your public rises as people could talk about
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   you.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.000]   And part of the problem Danny's absolutely right is this is by setting the pedestal very
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   high.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.160]   Anytime Google makes a mistake, that doesn't do something evil necessarily, but makes
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.760]   a mistake, screws up, does something wrong.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.520]   Be in the company and this gigantic company does something wrong.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.480]   Does that overnight make the entire company evil?
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.200]   That's just absurd on its face.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.960]   No, it doesn't.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   It doesn't.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.800]   Like the Kenya fraud and the click, the, you know, the hidden form trickery, you can
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.240]   say, okay, a team within the company screwed up.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.360]   And I mean, the great thing about Google is that they come out and say, we're sorry,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.920]   we shouldn't, we shouldn't have done that.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.760]   You know, is evil is not a Boolean variable, right?
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   It's not true or false.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.600]   Maybe we can all agree to that.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.400]   And, and, you know, but Matt's post is bringing up the question.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.160]   I think the question is worth asking.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.280]   People were not asking this question before and I don't think that this is by as pollsters
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.640]   or sensationalist media or journalists.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.120]   I think that this is a reasonable question to ask.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.480]   I mean, I think we all kind of gave Google a pass because it seemed like, you know, because
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.640]   they, they, they, they are a company.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.800]   They're acting more like a company and less like just a proponent of the open web, which
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   is always how they kind of.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   That's Danny's point.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   It was workhouse.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   Right.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   They always were a company.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.640]   And that's, that's why I really like, you know, I like Danny's point.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.600]   As for how we define Don't Be Evil, I always define that as the company acts in the interest
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.560]   of the users first instead of the interests of the company with the understanding that
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.400]   in the end, in the long term acting in the interest of the users only is beneficial to
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.560]   the company.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.880]   Can we all agree that that's?
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   I like that definition.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   That's.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.600]   It's also difficult because in the interest of users is not black or white either.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   Right.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   You know, there's different users.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   Siva, Siva button nothing.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.520]   I would argue that that, and I, I disagree with him here, but, but he says that every
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.000]   company must be evil in, in the sense that they, they must operate in the, they have
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.200]   a legal responsibility to operate in the benefits to do short fiduciary benefits of the shareholder.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   I disagree with that.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   I'm with Gina on this one.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   I do.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.000]   In the long term benefiting the user is good fiduciary.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Fair business.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   But it's not, it's in the short term.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It may not be obvious.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.840]   But in the long term it is.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.360]   But the, the different, sorry.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360]   I can't see you very well.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   So I'm interrupting.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   I can't, sorry.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.360]   Go ahead, Danny.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   I was going to say the, you know, with two things.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.560]   One to what Gina was saying also it that, that has all these little things that have
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   happened.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   I think it really.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.000]   I wrote, gone to the bigger, bigger issue of this where before you wouldn't have questioned
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.520]   Google, you go ahead, all these sorts of crazy things they'd be accused of.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.880]   But then when you have like, what did you do in Kenya?
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.960]   And what did you do with the Safari thing?
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.240]   Suddenly things that you might have dismissed or you might have, you know, said, okay, that's
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.320]   a one off.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.240]   They can be added up into something bigger.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   And I don't think that they really are.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.520]   I don't think they suddenly the company said we're going to be evil.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.560]   I do think the company become more aggressive in a lot of things that they've been doing
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.680]   and not as hesitant to go out and stuff.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   But I don't think it was like Larry called them all out and said, all right, now we're
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680]   going to be evil.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.440]   I think there's two things.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.040]   Go ahead, Jeff, and then I'll talk.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   I wanted to screen one way and then agree with you another way.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.560]   And I think that the things that were listed in Matt's post, the things you just listed,
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.920]   are actions of one person, one small department often were screw ups, often didn't see the
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.720]   unintended consequences was not corporate policy.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.840]   So in that sense, I'm going to say they don't add up to any indictment of evil.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.040]   What I do think does add up to an indictment of evil that is a corporate policy that does
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.240]   reflect on the entire company is Google's devil's deal with Verizon against a neutral
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   web.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.440]   You know, screwing up on the Safari thing, screwing up in Kenya.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.080]   You know, even screwing up here and that that's some bozo did something wrong, just like
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.240]   the data that was captured in Street View.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.000]   Yes, you need a culture that tries to stop people from doing that.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But you know what?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.360]   It's inevitably going to happen.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.760]   People will screw up or they won't get the culture or whatever.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.040]   That to me doesn't add up.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.360]   But the Verizon deal is the corporation as a whole saying, you know what?
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.080]   Screw you whole internet, screw you net neutrality.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.760]   And that wasn't even listed.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.400]   But I think that's where I go to the question of Chant-D right by the user can also follow
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.000]   apart because I don't think Google thinks that doing that Verizon deal was doing wrong
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   by the user.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.680]   I think that they were convinced that this was a corporate move that they were making,
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.920]   that ultimately is in the user's right interest.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.080]   And where I think they sometimes go wrong.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.920]   I think there was a lot of argument about that, Danny.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   Wasn't there on campus?
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.800]   I think there were a lot of people on Google who said no.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   This is this.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   There are.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.240]   But I don't think that I don't, people will disagree about all sorts of things within
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.800]   Google about what Google ultimately does.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.960]   But I don't think when you finally make the decision that the people go forward, the
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.480]   decision think, eh, this is better for us than the users were going to do it.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   I do.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.760]   How do you justify that decision though?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   How do you justify that decision?
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.440]   And that'll mean to go back, you know, six months now.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.480]   You can do it the same way that they did it like when they went into China.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.360]   Well, you know, maybe we've got to do this thing first, but we can't get, we can't make
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.520]   changes with the mobile networks if we're constantly fragging for Verizon.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.080]   So we throw Verizon in this bone and then down the line and, you know, five years we're
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   able to do like what we did with Sprint and now we can have the porting numbers or we
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   can do other stuff.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.000]   So I, but I think that where they tend to go wrong is not understanding that I think
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.440]   that Google gets a corporate view of what they think is right for the user and they
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.800]   cannot be shaken from it.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.320]   And you'll have other people who will say, I'm sorry if we don't necessarily agree with
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   you.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.920]   And it's like, oh, you're strong.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.440]   It's like, no, it's much more nuanced than that.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.600]   And it's actually not that everybody's necessarily wrong.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.360]   It could be that both people are right, both people are wrong, or maybe you really are
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.520]   wrong on this sort of front.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.960]   And that's what I don't tend to get from Google.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.600]   Sometimes it's the sense of, yeah, we made a mistake here in our corporate decision when
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   they make mistakes.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.400]   I also think that they do a bad job and, and, and in defending themselves when they need
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.840]   defense that the, the, and we've had this discussion a show many times, but all in all,
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.520]   I think that the consolidated privacy policy, simplified privacy policy is all at all good,
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:46.040]   but the press against it is extreme, not just press, but, but also government action.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.440]   And, and they didn't explain it well.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.520]   They didn't say it well.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.560]   They didn't realize what people were going to think about this.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.600]   It's still the problem I've said on the show before that that some see them as Godzilla
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.080]   and they see themselves as snuffle up against, but in either case, you can, you can crush
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   the hamster.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.920]   There's a thanks to Ohm's Law in our chat room.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.880]   Great name, Ohm's Law.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.440]   There is a Wikipedia page in which all of the criticisms of Google have been encapsulated
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.840]   if you would like to go through what people are complaining about.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   It strikes me that there's, there's, there's two different kind of schools.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.840]   One is that moral panic that you and I have talked about Jeff where we say Google's tracking
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   us.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840]   Oh my God.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.560]   And, and all of this was really, I think a lot of this conversation comes with the fact
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.400]   that on March 1st, only a few weeks ago, Google changed, you know, unified all the data
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.320]   from all of its sites and, and for the forced people to read the privacy policy, which I
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.080]   think most would agree forcing people to read the privacy is not evil.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.240]   You know, to have a privacy policy, a unified privacy policy is a good thing.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.000]   And then so some people just hate tracking cookies, but then it is hard not, it is hard
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.960]   to forget these kind of consistent starting, I think, with the street view incident where
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:05.360]   they were gathering access point and information from open access points, which I think we
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.320]   agree really was just an error in engineering.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   It wasn't useful.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.440]   But I think that's where I would say it began.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.200]   Certainly China, Kenya, iOS, Safari.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.840]   And then you, you talk about it.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:26.320]   And I think Matt talks about it particularly what bothers me more is Google's fundamental
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:34.600]   business, which is the search business being corrupted by desire to, and I'll quote Matt,
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.280]   deliver, in trying to deliver personalized results, Google polluted the page with its
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:45.520]   own fear, your products, Google plus instead of Twitter, Google places instead of Yelp,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.160]   while banishing competitors to lower listings and their results.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.000]   And I, that's to me that was a search plus year world.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.040]   That was to me when I really started to, you know, I can maybe we could maybe get make
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.520]   excuses for engineering errors, rogue teams, moral panic in the case of tracking cookies,
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.400]   but I care about Google search results.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   And when they start promoting their own products above other products in search results, that's
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   to me when it's demonstrably, I don't want to say evil because that's not evil.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.640]   It's no more evil as you point out, Danny, than Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and everybody
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   else.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.120]   But that's when it, it's kind of started to put its own interests ahead of its customers
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   interest.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.120]   If Gina, would you agree with that?
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   Yes.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:36.160]   Those products were returning this as good or better search results than other products,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.960]   then I would say, fine, it's okay.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.640]   But you know, if you focus on the user.org, we talked about this, you know, Google's,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.280]   you know, Google plus a search plus year world, which is the default setting if you're signed
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.720]   into Google, is just not better.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.080]   And you know, Google will say that their data shows that it is better, that people,
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.320]   people are, you know, that the behavioral data that they've captured shows that search
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.160]   plus year world results get better response than without it.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.720]   And I don't like this in the black bar.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.600]   This is really to me, reprehensible.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.720]   They're forcing everybody who uses any Google page to see this Google bar.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.880]   And now I've got an ad, what is essentially an ad for good play in my Google bar.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.120]   But, you know, this is where eyes put off.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.560]   And I don't, I don't necessarily like it either.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   And I think that the search results are, one could argue that they were badly done.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.640]   But I don't think that I keep coming back to the media example.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.120]   Yahoo doesn't promote Google.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.480]   The New York Times doesn't promote the New York Post.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.080]   It is a company and a product.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.360]   And it actually uses its own space far, far less than other companies promote things,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.880]   you know, go from that page and then you go to the Yahoo page and you tell me who's,
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.200]   who's thinking of the user first still.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.480]   And number two is that, yeah, they do go off the data.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   They do insist that their search results are improved by social.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.320]   You know, the area, I don't think search is dead by any means, but I think what Google
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.680]   has done is proved Mark Zuckerberg right that every company must become social, including
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.840]   Google.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.800]   And yes, they are going for signals and no, it doesn't violate our privacy to know that
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.400]   we search for pizza and they give us pizza for God's sakes.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.840]   That's the moral panic thing.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.080]   So what you have here is two things going on.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.920]   One is Google going to promote its own products?
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   Yes.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.600]   Does it do that in the core search?
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.600]   Not really.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   Search results.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.200]   Does it put in social stuff?
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   Yes.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   Do they believe that that's going to improve search in the long run for each of us?
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   Yes.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.000]   I think they do believe that.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Okay.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.440]   Yeah, they believe that.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.880]   They do believe that.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.400]   It's really complicated also because some of the things that Matt's talking about, he's
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   mixing things up.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   Right.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   Right.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.840]   So it's plus your world didn't put Yelp into things versus Google places.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.160]   And in fact, we still have Yelp within Google and we're actually talking about things like
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.960]   Google Maps, which in some cases, getting the map is a far better search experience
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.120]   than when you do a search and you wouldn't get it.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.680]   However, it was coming up.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.320]   So there's that confusion that's beginning with.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.440]   There's also confusion between the idea of personalizing search results based on social
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.800]   signals, which has a lot of advantages and has a lot of potential to it because goodness
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.240]   knows using the link signals that we have out there is becoming more and more archaic.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.800]   But there's also the issue of then also just trying to get people to use Google plus itself
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.480]   by taking part of your search results page and shoving this here or doing too much of
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.280]   what I call Google plusifying everything.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.080]   And it's all in your face.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.000]   But the core stuff that they're doing isn't different than what you do with being.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.960]   I mean, you go over the being, it's personalized based on your Facebook data.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.960]   Right.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   And it's just going to happen.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.920]   And if you want to turn it off, just like Google, you got to deliberately log out and
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   you got to prevent it from happening.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.360]   But if a Twitter result is a better result or a, you know, if I search for Lady Gaga and
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.240]   the Twitter result is a better result than the Google plus result, but the Google press
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:04.760]   result shows up first, to me, that's modifying search results to benefit yourself.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.000]   That's not about social signals.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   It's about.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And tell me what company doesn't do that.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.440]   Well, I'm not saying no.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.160]   And I made this point and you made this point that Amazon, Microsoft, everybody does this.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.880]   But that's what Google was saying.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   Don't be evil.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.880]   We won't be like them.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   But there's a lot of evil.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.640]   And that's one of the key things I think they get into when you come back to what do
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.320]   we do for the user?
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.200]   The way they have promoted Google plus has been very, very in your face.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.400]   And it has made me and a number of people scratch our heads and think, what on earth
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.560]   is going on that you guys have done this?
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.240]   And at the same time, you go back to Matt's piece where he's saying, well, you know, Google's,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.760]   they really Eric Schmidt screwed up by not cutting a deal.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.320]   It's like, yes, it is a screw up that they don't have a deal with Facebook and Twitter.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.120]   And on the flip side, they did have a deal with Twitter and maybe they were never going
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.880]   to get a deal with Facebook.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.920]   And maybe part of the issue here is not just that they didn't get a deal, but that Twitter
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.400]   and Facebook have data that is actually belonging to us, the people who created.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.760]   And if we want our data to be in our frickens Google search results, they should be there
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.840]   whether or not Facebook and Google decide they want to do a deal or not.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.800]   I want to go through on Google and search through and find all of my tweets.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.120]   I want to be able to do it from Google.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   But is that Google's fault?
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.160]   And I don't want to be prevented from being able to do that because whatever it is that
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.120]   Twitter has is a problem with Google and whatever it is Google has a problem with Twitter.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.960]   It's preventing that from Twitter.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.120]   And the problem is Twitter.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.200]   And you know, God knows for years I've been bitching about that and the Twitter is a silo.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:39.080]   But I think in that kind of climate, you look at Google saying, well, if I did this interview
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.240]   with a mitts and gall who runs Google search, right?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.160]   And this was two weeks after the search plus your world came out.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.840]   And he finally started talking about, look, we built all this stuff around Twitter.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.920]   We built all these things into Google, which a lot of people have forgotten used to exist,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   right?
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.040]   You could go into Google News to see the number of people who tweeted things.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.280]   You could see people who had tweeted stuff associated with the story.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.680]   He's saying that basically the deal expired.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.360]   We couldn't get it to keep going.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.240]   And we had to take apart all this stuff, stuff that we had lots of engineers working
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   on.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.400]   And I think Google's lesson from that was we can't depend on somebody else.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   We'll have to build something our own.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   And I think that their mindset is--
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.200]   They told-- Matt Cutz was on this show and said that.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   I know.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   Right.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.680]   And I was at the Google+ engineers who were very upset when they lost that stuff.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.840]   They wanted that stuff.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   It's not because they're trying to screw Twitter or Twitter or screwed them.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.960]   And us, because again, you're right, Danny.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.040]   It's our stuff.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.960]   And I did a different piece that was called something-- I think it was like social detente
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   or something like that.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   I'll look it up later.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:46.240]   But what I was trying to suggest is that maybe there is a way that we can get to having it
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.640]   so that it was called a proposal for social network to talk.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:55.560]   And what I was saying was that things like the actual content that we create on Twitter
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.400]   or Facebook ought to be public and ought to be crawlable by anybody.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   Right?
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   Well, Gee, Gee, I don't mean to get ahead of us.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.520]   But is that what ThinkUp app can help fix?
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.240]   It is one of the things that ThinkUp can help fix.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.840]   But the way we get around it is that everyone kind of creates their own--
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.160]   You're not getting the fireballs yet.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   Gets their own API using their own-- basically using their own API access.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   Right?
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.640]   So the issues that the Google bot can't crawl-- I mean, Twitter creates open web pages,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.640]   public web pages, right?
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   Right.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   Facebook doesn't.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.360]   So at least Twitter's a little ahead of Facebook in that it's creating a bunch of web
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   pages.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.040]   And you think, well, why can't the Google bot just go retrieve all those pages?
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.760]   It would be incredibly inefficient.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.920]   But also, it's just subject to limits, right?
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.040]   So Google has to have the firehose, which is the stream of up-to-the-minute tweets.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.840]   And that's part of, I think, what they lost.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.880]   Although I'm sure that that deal that they had involved lots of other tech.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.200]   But yeah, one of the things that ThinkUp is trying to solve is to make this decentralized,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:58.120]   to not have one search engine crawling on Twitter, but to have your own installation
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   that uses your own API calls and captures your data and makes it searchable and retrievable.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   It's a tough problem, though.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.320]   And it's not the most efficient solution for us.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   We'll talk.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   I want to talk more about that ThinkUp reboot.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   Because that's a definite hot topic.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.200]   Google I/O.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:20.760]   And somebody suggested that your number this week, Jeff, should be one, the number of elephants
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.560]   who use Galaxy Note phones.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.960]   We'll show you that video.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.800]   It's coming up just.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.960]   But first, let's talk about go to my PC from Citrix.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:37.080]   The best way to get remote access on your Mac or your PC, absolutely barn on secure,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   easy uses.

[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.480]   You don't have to punch holes in the firewall.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.800]   It's always a risk.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.920]   And what's great about it is go to my PC puts your office computer into your iPhone or
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   your iPad.

[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.400]   But the point is put it on a computer and then hit the road.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.760]   Download that free app for the iPhone or the iPad.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.400]   And you can log into that computer Mac or PC and do anything you could do if you're sitting
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.480]   right in front of it.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.760]   Edit the PowerPoint, update a spreadsheet, print documents, work on files, send and receive
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.160]   email just like you were at work.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.240]   It is amazing.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.360]   It is secure, 128-bit SSL.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.040]   It is easy to use and it's super fast because they use some very sophisticated algorithms
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.520]   to make sure that they only update the parts to change.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   You can be amazed.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.280]   It really looks like you're using a Windows machine on your iPad or iPhone.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   Try it today.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.280]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.200]   The offer code is TWIG TWIG.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.960]   I think you will like it.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.680]   And we do thank our friends at Citrix because they're great supporters.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.160]   Also works on Android tablets by the way.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:03.440]   I should mention that since we are this week in Google, iPhone, iPad and Android tablets.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.000]   So what is the...
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.360]   We wrote an article on smartaward.org.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.600]   Think up, reboot and a special request.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.440]   Gina, why don't you fill us in on this?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.720]   We, Neil and I, Neil Dash and I have applied to the Knight Foundation's news challenge,
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.880]   which is a media contest that awards grants to its winners.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.680]   So we entered Think Up into the contest.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:32.320]   So the special request is that you like our application on Tumblr because that will help
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.680]   us advance to the next round.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   The number of likes and re-vlogs on Tumblr helps the Knight Foundation choose finalists
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.520]   to get on to the next round because they got like a thousand applications and they're only
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   going to be about five winners.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.600]   That's a great contest.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.360]   What is the message, Jeff?
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   What do they do?
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.480]   The Knight Foundation is the key funder of journalism projects in education in the US.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.960]   I am the director of the Tau Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism and thank you
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.600]   very much those two foundations for making it possible.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.040]   And we should point out that gives Gina no advantage.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   No.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.520]   None whatsoever nor nor me.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.240]   I've applied for it and lost, but he's fine.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   It doesn't even help you.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.520]   No, they run them and they run a lot of different things.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:23.040]   They do community stuff and I'm helping some people in New Jersey do a proposal right now.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:31.080]   But the Knight News Challenge is an effort to get people to create new technology, new
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.280]   ways to do journalism, all kinds of new things and get innovation going.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.440]   And God bless Knight, you think they'd be kind of sticking the muddish being the foundation.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   They're the opposite.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.960]   They're kicking the industry in the ass saying you got to change.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.280]   You got to do new things.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.840]   So they just changed the Knight News Challenge.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.280]   It used to be once a year.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.840]   Now it's three times a year with a theme and this theme is networks.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   And one of the great things about it, what makes me so delighted is if suddenly now for
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.920]   the first time the mainstream news industry can get Gina to Japan, his brains and smarts
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:10.840]   involved in what we do and vice versa, I think that's a great cross pollination and so necessary.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.680]   And so that alone is one of the great benefits of the Knight News Challenge.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.880]   My friend John Bracken is one of the people running it and yeah, he's overloaded with
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.120]   a thousand applications.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:27.360]   They have a jury of unnamed people who will go through this with some meticulous care.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.320]   And then they'll be further rounds.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.760]   But I would suggest Gina that no matter what happens with this one, keep going with Knight
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.680]   because they're smart people that recognize you are smarts and they'll know how much
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   we need you.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.400]   And let me show everybody what Gina is asking you to do step by step.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:51.720]   You could go to smarterware.org and you can just click a link there or you can go to newschallenge.tumbler.com
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.520]   and click the search entries and enter think up and search.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.720]   And the very first result will be your application to think up.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.000]   And then there's a heart.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.680]   You've already got 293, but let's see if we can get that number up.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680]   I'm going to add one.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.760]   Oh, watch out the pile.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:15.200]   I can't imagine that anyone could conceivably even come close to the number we can get right
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.680]   now if each and every one of you watching live and those of you listening after the
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:28.360]   fact and watching the video go to the Knight Foundation newschallenge.tumbler.com and
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.560]   click that heart next to think up.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.040]   There are very few things that I would want to throw the power twig behind.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.640]   This is something that's important enough to me to ask.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.920]   And Jeff, I just wanted to thank you very much for your kind words and from your lips
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.120]   to John Bracken's ears.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.560]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   You know, our chances are really slim.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   Chances are we won't make it.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   This is a super prestigious contest and there are some amazing entries, but we're hoping
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.600]   that they'll consider it.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.160]   We're actually converting expert labs, which was the nonprofit or funding organization
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.720]   for think up into commercial entities.
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.600]   So Neil and I are co-founding a new think up company.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   And this is kind of one of the--
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   Have a little bit of a baby.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   I know, I know.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   That's it.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.160]   I'm going for it.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.600]   I really am a capitalist.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.360]   I think I said that a couple of shows ago that I've been converted.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.320]   But this is one of the initial kind of avenues of funding that we're looking at.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.200]   We want to get some kind of smart, good money behind us.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.480]   And Knight and Knight is what we'd be honored to do.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   Which is important too.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.600]   Knight doesn't just give to not-for-profits, which is very unusual for a foundation.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   It is.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   They also will give to for-profit ventures.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.760]   I don't know how it's structured as a loan or a grant or whatever.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.080]   And they're going to do some investments too.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.840]   So they funded a center for entrepreneurial journalism.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.880]   They want to fund entrepreneurs.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   And that's a good thing.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   Yes.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.920]   In fact, on the application, they ask you, how do you intend to make money from this
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.000]   business or continue this business after the grant is up?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.880]   So we really like that.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.800]   So we're giving a chance.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.720]   The whole idea about think up for us is the pendulum swings from centralized to decentralized
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   and back.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.560]   So it used to be mainframes and dumb terminals.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.000]   And then it was the web and you pushed computing power out to the edges.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.440]   And now we're kind of getting back to centralized again, where we have these big giant behemoths
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.240]   hosting all of our data and doing all our computing for us.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.960]   And you saw the same thing with smartphones, right?
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.400]   At first there were no apps, but now there are apps where we're all walking around with
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.080]   a computer in our pocket, which is something that seemed insane years ago.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.760]   I think, Anil and I believe that setting up people, people who have their own, who run
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.600]   their own web services can capture and archive data and analyze it in ways that are never
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.160]   going to happen in the centralized model that we have now.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.720]   So it's a really ambitious goal to kind of set decentralized social network to create
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.000]   a peer to peer way to capture and archive your data and exchange between those peers.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.360]   But we're going to give it our best shot.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.080]   So this is just the beginning.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   Gina one question.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.600]   If I am waiting for the hosted solution because I'm an idiot.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.320]   But when that when that day comes and I have my page of all my, uh, Blatherings, Google,
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.440]   Google at that point, and going back to Leo's version of course, Google could obviously
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.120]   scrape that with my, with my, um, greatest sense.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.720]   And there you go.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.840]   That's the stuff that can, there's no reason that it can't appear in search.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   But it won't.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.760]   The most authoritative, well, no, wait, I'm asking, no, then it's not a Twitter feed so
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   much.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.240]   It's, it's, it's Jeff's think up app social page that happens to have the most authoritative
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.200]   lady Gaga tweets on it.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.760]   Now you get out of that Twitter deal and now you become just plain content again.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   Right.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   And it is true.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.840]   If I search for Jeff Jarvis, I find your number one result is your blog.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.200]   And number two results are your blog, then Wikipedia, then Twitter, then Google plus.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.880]   So that, you know, I don't, they're not being evil in that regard.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.280]   They would, I'm sure put it up there.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.920]   Although we do find a page for you, but you have to sign up to follow Jeff Jarvis on Twitter
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.760]   and all of that.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.440]   And I even signed up for their author program.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   So that's why I get the little logo is there.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.440]   You little bug.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   You get the geek.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   That's good.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   You're getting, you're getting Gutenberg, the geek.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   I've loaded it.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   That's great.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.440]   Yes.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.600]   See, you know, features like that, you know, the, the, the author byline in search results,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:20.160]   that little link that says ask your friends on Google plus, that seems like reasonable
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.720]   promotion of Google plus to me.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   That doesn't bother me.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.680]   Well, but let me show you, let me show you the auto complete on Jeff Jarvis.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.040]   And this is, this is where I get a little bit bugging on that.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Well, right.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   And that's the default, right?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.120]   You have to turn off personal, personalize results, I guess.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.840]   See, the problem with the, the author thing is that when they rolled out the author, they
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.200]   rolled out the author tag last year before we had Google plus, and it was the way that
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.880]   you could have a buy link to really whatever you wanted to as a verified author.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.720]   It didn't have to go to your Google plus page.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.160]   It could be going to your Facebook page if you wanted to.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.320]   And then after Google plus came out, it morphed into basically being you have to have a Google
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.640]   plus account if you want that to be happening.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.360]   And that's actually a really bad example of where you're like, why did you do it that
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.360]   way?
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.200]   Because you really want us to use Google plus and you've made it much more easier for people
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.880]   to have a buy offline to where it's, I, I have an author page at search and she'll
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.000]   land, why can't I point people to that page?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.400]   Why do I have to point them to this one?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.800]   And that's because that's the way they changed how authorship was supposed to work.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.880]   If I'm not somebody's friend on Google plus, will it still do that?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.960]   Yes, I'm logged out right now completely and I'm in cognitive mode and I get that buy
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.520]   And if I click on the buy Jeff, Jerry Grant's debt, who is a Google plus page that I'm not
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   following?
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.520]   That's what I need.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   Um, Jason Kellicomas.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.000]   Yes, there's actually, I think I am following him unfortunately.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Good, good tribe.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   No.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.120]   But I mean, Google, Google argues that the reason that they've done that also is they're
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.360]   trying to help verify people's identities that they think that they can improve search
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.640]   results if they know who Jeff Jarvis really is.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   Well, that's true.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.520]   I was bitching when I made a Google profile and it wasn't the first thing on my Google
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.520]   search results.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.720]   So, right, they should be, but, but, but, but I think that part of what Danny's saying
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.040]   implicitly is they're not explaining this well enough that there is a rationale behind
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.200]   what they're doing, but they always remain so mysterious about it.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.360]   We don't say what we're doing and why we're doing it.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   And that's not just Google.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.460]   I've argued that the media industries and the advertising industries and other technology
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:29.140]   companies are just so bad about not just putting out legal documents, but also letting
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.960]   us into the tent and they're thinking about why they're doing it and what they're trying
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.240]   to accomplish for the users.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.520]   And then the users have a different view.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.680]   And again, I keep on going back to Amazon.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.160]   Why did we give this recommendation?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   Here's why.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   That's all we want.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.600]   And it may be just a feeling it may not really be logical, but here's what it feels like.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   It feels like Google Plus is already starting to look like another buzz, another failed product
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.440]   from Google.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.200]   I have to say that's the feeling I get anyway and that they're still trying to force it
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.720]   down people's throats.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.400]   It's not, it's not anything like buzz.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.920]   It's better than buzz.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   Buzz was a really horrible experience.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   It's far better than buzz.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.920]   I'm going to do a post.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.920]   I've been trying to write this.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.600]   Maybe I'll probably get it done this weekend, but it basically says something like, you
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.480]   know, Google Plus is Google's Apple Store.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:22.160]   So number one is succeeded in the fact that it has allowed a bunch of Google to some degree
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.600]   fanboys and fan girls, if you want, to go in there and have a place that they can conglomerate.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.240]   And there are people who like Google who want to talk about Google, want to be happy with
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.320]   Google, who simply do not want to do that over Facebook.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.200]   And they have found a home there.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   Believe me.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.640]   But if that's all Google Plus, if all Google Plus is a place to talk about Google.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.880]   I don't talk about just Google there.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   I talk about lots of things there.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.360]   I'm not saying that's the only place it is.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.440]   I'm not saying that's the only thing it is.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.720]   But I'm saying that is one thing that they have never had before that is useful for them.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.080]   That in some way, it's almost better support forums.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.920]   The people who use this product all the time can go in there and interact with it.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.480]   And that alone, I think, kind of makes it successful for them.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.640]   But it's more than that.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.640]   There are people in there.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   Well, photographers, for instance, it's a great place of your photographer.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.880]   There are people in there who are commenting.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.600]   There are people in there who do post the content there.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.960]   It is not the activity level that I see anywhere near what you see on a Facebook or a Twitter.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   Right.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.920]   But I'm going to disagree with you, not for me.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.400]   And part of it is because I have a lot of followers.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.360]   But I find that the quality of conversation is better in Google Plus than I find certainly
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   on my blog.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.920]   And that's probably my fault.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.520]   And to some extent, depends on the day.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520]   It depends on the mood or the universe in Twitter.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.520]   I find the conversation there just--
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.080]   No, I'll agree with you on that.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.440]   Even on Facebook, Facebook's a lot of spam and there's garbage.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.440]   Yeah, it is not bad.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.360]   Because it's still kind of a geek salon.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   That's why.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.240]   I mean, it's still very-- you know, kind of nerd-centric, like tech-journalist-centric,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   right?
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   And that's what we are.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.520]   So those are kind of our people.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.240]   So it seems like the conversation is a little bit better.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.400]   But, Gina, you've got almost a million followers, don't you?
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   I do.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.880]   And you know, well, I have to clean out a lot of spam on almost every post.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.880]   And you know, it's funny.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.000]   I wrote my response to Matt Houghton's piece on Gizmodo against Google on Google Plus
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.160]   because I knew that it was the best chances I had for Google.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.960]   Like the most Google employees would see it if I posted it there and set it up on my
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   blog.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.600]   That was a pretty mindful decision.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.840]   But Google Plus is way better than Buzzer.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.560]   Way far better than Wave.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.640]   And I think it's going to be around a lot longer--
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.800]   Yeah, because they're putting all their horses behind it.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   Well, right.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   I don't think that--
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.400]   They're forcing it down our throats.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   Yeah, they are.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   But it's not going away.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   I don't think that's an option.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   I don't think that's an option in the company.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.320]   I think the company has made this decision that this is their core product, that this
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   is just Google from--
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.680]   That's what kind of bothers me.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.440]   They're using their cloud as a search company to promote products like Google Plus.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.760]   That's not having one on their own map.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.920]   They haven't won on their own merit.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:07.080]   They're using their cloud as a phone company to promote their maps.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.640]   It's difficult because on the one hand you can say that and on the other hand you can
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:17.200]   say, OK, we know that we need to have social signal to improve our search quality.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.160]   We also know that we cannot get the social signals based on Twitter.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.960]   So what-- and Matt said to social, it's like, what do you want them to do?
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:32.040]   At that point, it's like there's no argument against them having this in many ways.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.800]   I think that there is an argument that they should have a system for people who want to
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.640]   favor content or share content or indicate that in a way that could interact with their
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.840]   Google search results to be able to do that directly.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.680]   That is one guaranteed way for them to go forward to have better signals unless people
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.160]   really enjoy content farms and link spam.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.840]   Unless we think that is to somehow get better.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.600]   We've got to have something else.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.760]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.760]   But they are all in and then they're borrowing chips and throwing it all over there.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.440]   And that's where you want to say, really, did you have to do the people and pages thing
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   up over here?
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.320]   Did you have to throw in every single possible thing you could do?
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.920]   And then also get Lady Gaga to do it as well.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.040]   She's mellow out a little bit.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.680]   That's my feeling, exactly.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.200]   That's execution, though.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.120]   That to me is not...
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.120]   That's not evil, it's just...
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   That's not evil, it's just...
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.160]   That's what we discussed last week.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.640]   That's why you hope someone like Kevin Rose brought in says exactly what Danny just said,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.480]   come on, do you have to do that?
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.480]   And they need more of that in the company.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.000]   But that to me is not going to go back to the thesis of the day, evil or good.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   That's good or bad.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Execution.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.640]   Well, I guess, I mean, to wrap it up and move on, people are saying in the chatroom, well,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   every company does this.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.720]   You do this, Leo does this to promote, he promotes other podcasts.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.320]   But I didn't say we're going to set ourselves up as...
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.860]   I mean, I guess what we're asking of Google is if you're going to be the company that
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:10.160]   indexes the internet, if you want to be the guardian of that, that you kind of have to
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:16.720]   recuse yourself from the normal promotional, hurly burly of the day-to-day world.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   That's what don't be evil means.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.120]   No, but that's what don't be evil means is we're going to be above that because we are
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.440]   the keepers of the search engine.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   But the...
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   But the...
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   I think you're limiting the relationship.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   Of the web.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.440]   And that was...
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.520]   And this is where Danny was headed to, I think, they are...
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.800]   And Matt as well, they want to be the answer company.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.560]   And the way to be the right answer company is to be able to know enough about you so
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.480]   that they can anticipate your intent and feed it.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.480]   Okay.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   And so be it.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.040]   And if you do that, get ready because you're going to get these conversations about our
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   evil.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.040]   Yes.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040]   Yes, I agree.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   That's the consequence.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040]   Fine.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.480]   You want to make that pivot and be the answer company.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   Fine.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   And people like me and you and everybody else are going to say, "Well, that sucks."
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.960]   Well, it's getting...
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.960]   They have a...
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.720]   Google has always had a balancing act and has gotten more and more harder for them to
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.200]   do as they compete with the same things that they list.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   The balancing act is...
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   Yes.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.400]   People trust your search results that they're supposed to be giving them the best information.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.840]   And for a long time, Google has delivered that and delivered it even in some cases where
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   they would have conflicts.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.360]   One of the biggest conflicts is any page that carries AdSense is potentially something
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.000]   that Google would want to favor over another page.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.600]   You really haven't had people say over the years that every time I do a search result,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.080]   I only get the pages that have AdSense on it.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   And so they seem to have gotten that balance right with these inherent conflict.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.680]   But now when you start having these things where you're like, "Okay, I'm doing these
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.800]   searches and I'm also getting all this Google+ stuff, but it might have been better if actually
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.560]   you would suggest that a Facebook link to me or Twitter link to me, why are you not doing
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   that?"
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.040]   That's where people start to go to, "Do I still trust these search results?"
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.480]   And that's the balancing act that they need to get right, so that we continue to trust
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:06.000]   the search engine to be the search engine as we want it, but that they're also able to
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.240]   go out here and build out these other things that may help the search engine as well as
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.520]   advance their other business goals.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.360]   And that's just between us, the user and Google.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.520]   There's a whole other argument when you get onto the antitrust aspect, which is if you
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:26.680]   have a dominant stance in search and you decide that you want to start pushing a social network,
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.880]   have you used your dominant stance in a way that violates antitrust laws?
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.240]   And that's part of what we'll see that's going to be happening.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:39.440]   But what I will say is that same kind of argument can come back to then haunt, say, Facebook.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.680]   Because if you have a dominant data situation at Facebook and you're only providing that
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.800]   data to one search engine, that being being, because they're the underdogs and we think
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.120]   the underdogs will do better, and you're not cutting any kind of a deal at all with Google,
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.840]   then potentially you're going to find yourself in four or five years having another antitrust
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.760]   argument being pointed at you saying you need to open all that stuff up and you need to
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.200]   figure out a way that there's a fire hose that anybody can get to that data if it's
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.960]   public data without it feeling like you're having some kind of favorite nation's thing
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   going on there.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.480]   Well, what we really see going on is an effort to negotiate new norms.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   I keep on saying this.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.280]   I just read a magnificent book and this ain't going to appeal to everybody called the institutional
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:24.880]   revolution that goes back to why did we move from things like patronage to run the army
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:31.280]   and run the Navy and paid positions and all these odd things back in the early period
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.120]   of UK to these new systems, any of the economists in the arguments will because we could measure
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.760]   things and we could thus measure performance and trust came out of measurement rather
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.720]   than out of patronage and the institutions of society had a change to catch up or they're
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.680]   always behind the technology.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.240]   What we're seeing here is this idea.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.680]   Well, already we've turned Google into this institution of saying, well, they're in a
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.760]   search engine, thus, that, what, that, that, well, they don't even know what they are
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   yet.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.320]   They're not finished being what they are yet, I think.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:02.000]   And so we're seeing constant birthing pains going on here in what's around us, not only
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.960]   for the old institutions, retail companies, government, universities, but also for the
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   new institutions.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.680]   Google is already a new institution and it's a painful process because the change is just
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.640]   going to keep on having an impact on what we expect of them.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.720]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   It's a great panel.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.320]   I got to tell you, when you have Danny Sullivan, Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani on one panel,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.240]   you know we're going to get some heavy duty conversation right now on Google, the cloud
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   and more.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.680]   Let's talk a little bit about cell phone companies.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:44.880]   When you, when you think of cell phone companies, do the words fair, honest, clear, usable,
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.120]   bleep to mind?
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:54.400]   No, that's why Ting is trying to reinvent cell phone service.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.320]   This is, when Elliot Noss of Two Cows came and showed us Ting last fall, I was so excited.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.760]   I said, I cannot wait to tell people about tingting.com.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.920]   It's built on the Sprint network.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.320]   So if you've got great Sprint service where you live, Ting will be a great choice for you.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:16.240]   But what I love about Ting, first of all, and I'm really pleased now Ting is offering
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.760]   some very nice top of the line Android phones.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.160]   They are primarily an Android company.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.960]   So you're going to get a smartphone.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.520]   For G, yes, on the Sprint network.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.800]   But what you've really got to look at is how they price it.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.280]   Because essentially what you decide is how many phones you're going to have.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.040]   Let's say we're going to have a family plan.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.000]   So that's $6 per phone, 24 bucks up front.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.760]   Then you choose, and this is separated by the way, minutes, text messages and megabytes.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.040]   Some people use a lot of minutes and not many megabytes.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:55.360]   Most of us geeks use a few minutes, a lot of text messages and a ton of megabytes.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.120]   But you're not stuck with these plans.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.720]   Now, what I just set out for four phones be $92 a month total, $92 a month.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.760]   I get free voicemail, picture and video messaging, through-way calling, caller ID, tethering,
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.120]   hotspot, and more.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.400]   Four phones, a family, a hundred bucks, less than a hundred bucks a month.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.500]   But here's the beauty part.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:20.460]   If I don't use all this, they give it back to me at the end of the month.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.500]   If I use more, there's no penalty.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.660]   They just charge me at the same rate for what I use.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:32.340]   So you pay for what you use and no more save a lot of money.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.700]   I mean, I'm talking a lot of money.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.700]   Here's a tweet from a user, new customer, February 19th.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.500]   My Ting, FTW, it's @Ting, FTW on Twitter.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.220]   Phonebill was $22 last month, $22.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.340]   That's exactly $100 less than with AT&T.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:53.820]   Family of four, actual usage across our four phones last month, 2,387 minutes, 4,000.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:49:02.380]   This is obviously teenagers, 227 messages, 429 megabytes of data, AT&T, $244, $ting, $103
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.380]   a month.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.020]   You can find out how much you'll save.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:11.020]   If you've got your usage, go to ting.com/twig and run the savings calculator.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.340]   You can figure out exactly how much Ting will save you.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.860]   There are other reasons to go with Ting, the best customer support I've ever seen in a
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   cell phone company.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:24.180]   A no-hold policy when you call their 800 number during regular business hours.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.820]   Once you get a service rep on the line, they will work through the problem and solve it.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.980]   No-weight customer support.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.620]   Email support, you could blog, you can, they've got a blog, you can tweet them.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.500]   It's run by Geeks, frankly, and they've got some great new devices that I'm very pleased,
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:46.540]   including the Samsung Galaxy 2, the 4G, and the Motorola Photon.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.380]   It says, "I love this."
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:54.340]   If it's the top of the line you want it, look no farther than the Photon.
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.900]   The Motorola Photon, the world phone your mom would ask for.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:01.180]   She was awesome at it, a taste for the top of the line, du-core and so forth.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.860]   Now, notice the price.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:09.020]   It's a less subsidized price, although if you use the Twig offer code, we'll save
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.100]   you $50 off on the phone.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.700]   But this is one of the ways they do it.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.860]   You pay a fair price for the phone and then you only pay for what you use.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.460]   It just makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.580]   You want less expensive phones.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.900]   They have a variety of Android phones.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.260]   Just simple.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.900]   The online management of your account is fantastic.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.660]   You'll know exactly where you stand at all times.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:39.860]   T-I-N-G.com, visit them today and just run that calculator at ting.com/twig and see what
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.460]   you would save.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.860]   Integrity, honesty, clarity, usability.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.420]   Yes, there is a cell phone company that offers that.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   Ting.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.580]   Who would think you could have an unevil phone company?
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.380]   I was going to say they're de-evilizing an industry.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.020]   And that was what Elliot said to me.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.980]   He said, "We've got to fix this.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.220]   It's broken."
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.660]   And because, by the way, no ETF penalties your month to month, that's why the phone costs
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.780]   a little bit more because your month to month.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.020]   There's no early termination.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.340]   That's a good fight to be in.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.620]   I like it, don't you?
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.340]   I said, "Elliott, I will do these for free."
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.420]   No, I didn't.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   I almost did though.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:21.100]   I said, "Elliott, even if you don't buy ads, I will absolutely talk about this because
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.300]   this is a revolution."
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.300]   Google I/O, did you sign up, Jeff?
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.300]   Yes, I did.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:29.300]   It's good thing.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.300]   Sold out in 20 minutes.
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.140]   My temperature size in there and everything.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.940]   We don't know what fancy free stuff you're going to get, but they ticket sold out in
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:37.940]   20 minutes.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.940]   You got to think, Gina, the fact that last two I/Os, people have been received all this
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:46.380]   stuff, phones and tablets, and that that has something to do with how fast.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.380]   Because they raised the price.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.180]   They doubled it, didn't they, this year?
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.180]   Yes.
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.180]   It's $900.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.380]   The swag is definitely part of it.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.820]   And there's just a surprise of it.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.780]   It's the possibility that you're going to get a device that isn't out yet or that's
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.500]   a special edition that's happened.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.780]   It's a great event though.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.780]   They expanded it.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.540]   I think it's three days this year, right?
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.540]   Or one day more.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:12.180]   And it really is a great event, great parties, great sessions, and just really fun place
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.020]   to be, but also the gadgets are really cool.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.700]   It doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.900]   They may decide the swag is evil this year though.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   You know what, that's fine.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.900]   It's still a great event.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.980]   June 27th, 28th, 29th.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.580]   But we shouldn't really sell it because nobody else, if you don't have a ticket.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.420]   Well, you can go to the extended ones.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:35.020]   It's like the TEDx that you can set up your own swagless Google I.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.980]   Oh, that's all right then.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.980]   That's all right.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.980]   90 days to sell out in 2009.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:41.980]   50 days in 2010.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.620]   59 minutes in 2011.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.860]   20 minutes in 2012.
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:51.580]   At this rate, next year, it's already sold out.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.940]   Well next year they'll already, since they know so much about you, they'll know that
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.940]   you want to come or not.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.940]   It's right.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.940]   You'll be signed up.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.940]   I'll just send you a ticket.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:58.940]   Google knows.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.940]   Google knows.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:07.860]   And as an ELSUAD last year, free browser under every seat.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:11.340]   This is not Jeff's number, the number one.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:16.020]   This is definitely a Samsung viral ad about Peter the Elephant.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.820]   So Peter the Elephant.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:23.380]   Now I have to say, so there's a Galaxy Note which is the phone I use as a ginormous phone.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.860]   And there's Peter the Elephant who is clearly a trained elephant.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:29.540]   But this does not look like a synthetic proboscopy.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.140]   They make a point in below that there's no, there's no video trickery.
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.140]   It's real.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.980]   That's, this is, I didn't know elephants.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.140]   Look at, he's a drama guitar.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.780]   This is a germaphobe's nightmare.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.660]   No, it's not slimy.
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.980]   Look at this.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.020]   He swipes through pictures with his little, it looks like a little finger.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.220]   Look how good he is.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.100]   There's some elephant is not going on there.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.100]   There's no snot.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.100]   This is a trunk.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.740]   And look, he can even draw.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.940]   I didn't know elephants had opposable trunks, but apparently they do.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.660]   He can hold an S pen.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:01.500]   Actually, I don't think that's an S pen.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.500]   Maybe it is.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.500]   I don't know.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.500]   This is my favorite.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   He takes a picture.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.500]   Snap.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   Okay.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:11.140]   The best is coming up.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:14.060]   Oh, nice elephant.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.700]   Here's the best part.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.860]   Bye bye.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.380]   That's not a wild elephant.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.380]   I'm guessing.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:22.100]   So it's even an elephant can use it.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.860]   That's the market message here.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.860]   Okay.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.860]   All right.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.860]   You know what?
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.420]   It works for me.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.940]   I got elephant-tined fingers.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:36.380]   Every time I look at the note, I want it, even though I don't want to carry the thing
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.380]   around.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:43.140]   I hate the fact that the phones have gotten larger and larger than versus my iPhone.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.300]   But then I look at the note and I think, but that's smaller than something else.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.300]   So anyway, I'm very happy with it.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.300]   It's very scary.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.940]   I even bulked it up more by putting it in a fancy leather case.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.940]   But it slides in my pocket.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.660]   The case kind of impedes it a little bit, but it slides in my pocket.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.660]   That's pretty.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.660]   That's pretty.
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:02.980]   I mean, it's artorially abhorrent.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   No, wait a minute.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.820]   Let me take it out of the case.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.700]   It's very slim and beautiful.
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.700]   It's very nice.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.700]   And it slides in pockets very easily.
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:17.820]   But this is where I really wish that I could just more easily turn my phones into accessories
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.260]   where I could just slide one into the other into the other because I want to see them
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.260]   in a small one.
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.260]   That's good.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.260]   Sometimes I want the big one.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.260]   The Matrusca phone.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.260]   I just carry different devices.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.260]   I love it.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.260]   I love it.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.500]   The Matrusca phone.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.820]   No, I couldn't be happier with it.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.820]   And I just love that ad.
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.940]   It just makes me right.
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:44.820]   Here is a post from blog.intercom.io that might help you choose your next Android phone.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.820]   Is it a condom or is it an Android?
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.820]   I love this.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   It's great.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.180]   Yeah, this is good.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.500]   I don't even want to go on.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.460]   So if what you do is these are all these are all actually we could play this game, but
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.940]   you all seen it, right?
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:02.940]   I can't remember.
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:03.940]   No, I just saw.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:04.940]   All right.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:05.940]   Let's play this game.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.140]   I will say the name of an Android phone.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.180]   You tell me condom or phone desire.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:11.180]   Phone.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.180]   Phone.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   Phone.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.180]   Both.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.180]   Condom.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.180]   Both.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.180]   Hero.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.180]   Phone.
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.180]   Right.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.180]   Resound.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.180]   Phone.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.180]   Phone.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.180]   Ultra thin.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.180]   Both.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.180]   Condom.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.180]   Condom.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.780]   Here's a trick.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.780]   One sensation.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.780]   Both.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.780]   Both.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.780]   Touch.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.780]   Both.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:35.780]   Crows.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.780]   Condom.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:37.780]   Both.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:48.700]   However, cruise control is a condom only.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.700]   Wild fire.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:51.700]   Phone.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.700]   Phone.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.700]   Phone.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:54.700]   Both.
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:55.700]   Both.
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.820]   I'm going to distinct disadvantage here people.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.820]   I do not.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:03.220]   You got no use for these.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.460]   Anybody that you know.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:07.700]   No use for them at all.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:08.700]   All right.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:09.700]   That's fine.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.700]   We'll move on.
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.620]   It's a pretty clever actually.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:13.620]   That's all right.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.620]   Very funny.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.700]   You had those different names.
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:23.380]   But it just shows you that there is a certain commonality in the people who name condoms and
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.380]   name smartphones.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:27.700]   Next it'll be Android versus stripper names.
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.700]   Oh.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:29.700]   Tiffany the phone.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:30.700]   Tiffany.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:38.580]   What do you, we mentioned this, but what do you think of this play and new in the Google
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.580]   bar?
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:40.580]   Does that bother you?
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.020]   The new is a little.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.060]   Can you take the new off Google?
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.060]   The new really draws attention.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.060]   I mean, that's the point that it draws your attention to it, but it just, yeah.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.060]   I don't.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.220]   Hopefully the new won't be there much longer.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.580]   The thing that no, I think is there for the duration.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.820]   They changed the bar.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:00.380]   There were a couple things that you might not have spotted.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:05.340]   For example, that bar used to have, it used to be video up there and they changed it to
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:06.340]   YouTube.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.180]   If you want to video, you got to go down below.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:09.180]   Oh, interesting.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.940]   And so, and there's a difference, right?
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:14.380]   There's a difference between using YouTube and using video, but that really seemed to
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:19.100]   be part of, we're turning this bar into being where you get from Google product to product
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.100]   to product.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.100]   Right.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.100]   Right.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.740]   Because all those things up there are Google products, not necessarily search products,
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.340]   Google search, Google images.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:31.340]   But see, but images is interesting too, because really, if you're going to put YouTube there,
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.940]   then why isn't images Picasa?
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:33.940]   Right?
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.940]   Oh, maybe it will be.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:36.940]   So it gets me.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.940]   I don't think anyone knows what Picasa means.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:38.940]   Right?
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.340]   Yeah, but yeah, because it doesn't have the brand.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:46.140]   Where Play really stood out for me is it is the first time I've seen Google put into
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.300]   its navigation a place where you can transact.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:50.300]   Right.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.060]   That's because Play is really the character telling content, right?
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.180]   You still have people who are confused to think, "Oh, that's just for Android," and it's
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.180]   not.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:03.260]   It is basically Google's iTunes, where you can go and buy TV, you can go buy video, you
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.740]   can go buy books, whatever you want to do.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:11.140]   And that is sort of the equivalent of them putting like, you know, Amazon up there.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.140]   And that's so weird.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.300]   It's again that weird balancing act.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:18.380]   Now, of course, if I go over to Bing and I look at their navigation bar, then up at the
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:22.460]   top, I'm going to get shopping and news and maps and travel and entertainment.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.180]   And the entertainment is, entertainment from the end of the world, it's going to be, you
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.700]   know, being entertainment or whatever.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.140]   So it kind of falls back into it.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.700]   Yeah, you promote yourself.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:34.300]   Maybe, maybe we just have, maybe I just have to give this idea, notion up that to Google
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:40.460]   is somehow some monastic, you know, keeper of, you know, the flame up on the heights.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.900]   They're just, they're company like anybody else.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.900]   They're promoting their products.
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:45.900]   Gina, you're right.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.060]   We don't give them, we don't need to give them a free pass anymore.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.060]   They're just,
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.060]   No, more free pass.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.740]   But that makes you have to rethink everything you do on the web because everything you do
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.700]   on the web has something to do with Google.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.620]   I mean, even, you know, webs, but even with AdSense and analytics sites that have nothing
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:03.060]   to do with Google have something to do with Google and YouTube embeds.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:07.420]   I mean, it changes the way that you think about being online.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:11.060]   If you decide that they, that they aren't, they, they don't have good intentions that
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.420]   they aren't about keeping the open web open.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.220]   I'm having a hard time with it because it's made me, I switched to duck duck go about
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.220]   a month ago.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.220]   I think we talk about it.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.220]   How's that been?
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.220]   It's been fine.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.220]   I mean, it's been great.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.780]   You know, duck duck duck go has these bang searches.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:29.660]   We could do like a exclamation point, PHP to search the PHP docs, you know, shortcuts
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.300]   to other places to search Wikipedia and things like that.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:36.700]   I've got, I took me a little bit to learn those, but I, I really like it.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.860]   I haven't really missed Google very much at all.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:43.180]   I searched, I still search Google for maps and images and on my phone, I use the iPhone.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:47.580]   You can't change your search engine in Mobile Safari to anything other than Google, you
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.780]   know, than their presets and duck duck go isn't in there.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.060]   So I am still using Google search occasionally, but honestly, I changed the default in Chrome
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.700]   and didn't, didn't really notice it.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.180]   So I use an Android phone.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.540]   I have an Android handset that I test my apps, you know, I develop apps on.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.940]   But you use an iPhone normally.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.340]   But I'm carrying an iPhone at the moment.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.740]   I mean, I feel like since I'm carrying an Android phone, Google already knows everything.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   Yes.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:16.300]   I mean, every because you don't, if you really want to have Android and you don't want it
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.980]   to be tied into Google, you can do that.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:19.980]   You change ROMs.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.020]   Well, no, you don't even have to do that.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.220]   You need to have a Google account.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.700]   So open a generic Google account.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:29.500]   You're done that that Google account doesn't have to be linked into your main Google account.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.860]   You don't use the math question.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:31.860]   You want all this out.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.860]   I see what you're saying.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.860]   So create a dummy account.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.700]   Well, that would work on the web too.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.860]   Just have an account that you don't use Gmail.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:44.140]   You don't use, but I mean, that dummy account now is starting to aggregate information about
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.140]   everything you do.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.380]   It doesn't need your name in it to be.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:51.540]   Well, it's going to, but I mean, when you do a search on your phone on Android, I don't
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.660]   believe it's going to log that stuff unless you let it do that.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.660]   But you're right.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.060]   I mean, I suppose the dummy account could do that, but I'm pretty sure you're not off.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.780]   Why are we so scared of?
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.780]   Well, I'm not.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.580]   Well, I'm not because they take our phones everywhere.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.580]   It's the horror.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580]   I don't worry about tracking, to be honest.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.580]   That's what I was talking about.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:13.180]   That's why I was making a distinction between this kind of moral panic over tracking and
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.540]   this, I think more legitimate to me anyway, this is my concern.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.940]   That's stupid to say it's more legitimate.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.900]   My concern is not tracking.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:28.620]   My concern is that the beautiful pristine search results are now sullied by economic
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.620]   interest.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.620]   That's the monkish.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.620]   And sir, yes.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.220]   I wanted a pure as the driven snow search result, but that's fine.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.220]   Who cares?
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.220]   They'll be better search results.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.220]   I'll acknowledge that.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:46.540]   But here's the irony is like at one point, Yahoo rolled out this page, you can still find
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:52.220]   it is at search.yahoo.com and they called it their Yahoo search pure search page.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.020]   And they did that because Google started becoming more and more popular because it
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.380]   was pure search.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:59.100]   And then people would be like, well, we don't want to have all this junk on Yahoo and they
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.980]   couldn't get away from being a portal.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:07.460]   Now interestingly, Google's homepage continues to remain pure, but Google search results don't
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.460]   feel pure.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.660]   There are people who are like, could I just have the search results if I want them without
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:17.540]   the more by this, without the faces, without all this stuff that in 2005, Marissa Mayer
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:21.900]   said would never, ever, ever have a search.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.580]   It's just ironic.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:31.940]   You wonder how do you do this? how do you become the search engine that you are on the
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.940]   backs of people who forgot what search was all about?
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.740]   And then still cause people saying, how do I get back to old Google search?
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:44.540]   How do you open up that opportunity for somebody like duck, which incredibly stupid name,
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.740]   which nobody using it.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.780]   And yet, and it's not going to, it's not going to take Google down.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:58.780]   But you have it, you have it appealing to some people who are influencers or whatnot, who
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.220]   are looking at saying, wow, you know, this is satisfying what I want.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.300]   Google should be doing that themselves.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.780]   We should have Google duck duck go already.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.540]   That's a good point.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.540]   Hashtag geek problem.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.460]   Yeah, of course it is.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.940]   But if we don't discuss it, who's going to?
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940]   Yes.
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.140]   Because mom's not talking about it.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:19.180]   But if we don't discuss this, who is going to, and this is our job, right?
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:23.300]   And I see this as our job to surface these issues, and I know the chat room is going,
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.660]   oh, I'm sick of this.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.780]   Let's talk about games and hangouts.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.780]   Okay.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.500]   I want Google to have competitors.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:35.060]   That's why I'm, that's why I'm excited that duck duck go has, has been fine for me.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:39.700]   I'm excited that they, they may not probably will not take Google down, but I also don't
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.220]   like the idea that Google so far ahead of anyone can do whatever they want and that
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.980]   that doesn't seem like there's a viable alternative.
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.620]   And I think that there are, and Google maintains that its users can leave and that there are
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.940]   plenty of viable alternatives.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.540]   So I think it's, I think it's kind of incumbent on us to say, hey, you know, that there are
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:58.260]   alternatives and here's what they are and here's what the trade offs are.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.220]   And duck duck go isn't a great name, but you get used to it.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.540]   It kind of grows on you.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:11.100]   Um, and, and there is an, in a discussion in duck duck go about how to change your, uh,
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:17.020]   your, your browser to make sure that it uses it instead of Google, right?
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.700]   Well, that does a lot of stuff too.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.700]   Look at this.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.420]   I'm going to, I'm going to do that.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.460]   Gina, I'm going to duck duck go.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.460]   I'm going to try it.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.460]   I'm going to go duck.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:33.220]   Enjoy being, because that's part of what it is, but that's a good point.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.700]   The results are being results.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.700]   Is that right?
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.100]   I mean, that's the other thing is that duck duck go duck duck go depends on having being
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.220]   in black or largely for its web searches.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:47.460]   So that if it really did get big, then you, you have to have them go through and try
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.620]   to negotiate a deal to kind of keep all those search results coming there.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.220]   But yeah, it's, you know, it's nice.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.700]   There's, there's things to like about it.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.820]   And if you're missing that pure search experience, there's, there's things to play with.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.860]   And if you're worried about privacy, goodness knows that's one of the things that they've
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.860]   been pushing at, which is, you know, we don't, we don't have this personalization of stuff
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:05.860]   happening.
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.620]   How are they going to make money?
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.620]   Probably not.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:14.540]   No, that's, that's the thing here is we have to admit that this is a capitalistic requirement.
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.540]   Nothing's free.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.340]   Google spends money on search as does duck duck go.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.020]   Google may mess up its whole business.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.140]   Google may in fact, and this is, this is the risk.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.300]   This is the huge risk.
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.860]   They could lose our trust.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.980]   They could become ugly.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980]   They could become cluttered.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.740]   You see Yahoo, they become a pain in the butt.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.740]   All of those things could happen.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.780]   So the Exxon execution, they could absolutely mess up, no doubt about it.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.380]   They're running a business.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.820]   And so they're going to do what the business needs.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.820]   And, and Gina, you were right when you said earlier, we're going back over the same territory,
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.820]   you said, right, you know, that the wise way to run the business is to put the user first.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.700]   They've always said that.
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.100]   Let's hope that's possible.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.940]   I just wish this weren't on my Google search page because I can't stop staring at it.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940]   I'm scared.
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:08.060]   Well, so let's talk about Hangouts.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.780]   There are games now in Hangouts, right?
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.940]   Is that what, is that what I hear?
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:11.940]   How do I do it?
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:12.940]   I want to do it.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:13.940]   I want to play.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.940]   You could put things on people's faces.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.740]   You couldn't know that I know about, but there's like actual games.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.780]   It's like, yeah, they've added more stuff now.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.380]   So how do I, how do I do this?
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.380]   Does anybody know?
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.380]   So I'm making a hangout.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   Go to the store.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.380]   Go to the store.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   Not a hangout.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.700]   Is it not from the Hangouts?
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.060]   No, I just don't need to.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.060]   Hangouts.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.060]   I don't like Hangouts, Danny?
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060]   No.
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.060]   I can't answer.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060]   We haven't had a show before.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.860]   I'm not going to be dressed.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.860]   It's like, oh, Leo's doing a hangout.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   I should go join that.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.460]   Yeah, why don't you join my hangout?
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.580]   You could play a game with me.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.340]   I think the world will collapse if we all end up in your hangout that's being broadcast
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.340]   on the show.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.500]   We did that actually.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.980]   It worked really well for the--
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.980]   Yeah, I'm going to hang out.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.980]   I'm going to put it on.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980]   Announcement.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.700]   We had a great-- and I invited tech journalists.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.780]   So they've got screen sharing.
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.780]   We knew about that.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.420]   That's not brand new.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:05.420]   I'm in your hangout.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.060]   I'll play poker together.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.780]   I could play poker now.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.620]   Oh, this becomes the zingification of--
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:18.340]   They have the clubhouse challenge, which is a trivia contest.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.340]   My airframey.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.980]   Do I add these?
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.700]   Oh, I have to add them.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.420]   Is that it?
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.220]   Slide shares in it.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.580]   Leo, where'd your hangout go?
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.580]   You're like gone.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.940]   Oh, fatal server.
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.380]   This, by the way, Google has clearly decided that I'm persona non-grata.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.340]   Not only am I off the suggested user list, but most of the time when I do a hangout,
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:41.060]   I get a dead robot.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.100]   That's why my hangout went away.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.100]   Oh, sad.
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.500]   It's all right.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.140]   I don't care.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.300]   So we can't demonstrate it because--
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.740]   I don't know why.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.540]   Come hang with us.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:59.260]   Play the WWHL Google Hangout Clubhouse challenge.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.980]   Just click on that play button.
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.420]   And then now I'm in Bravo territory.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:08.100]   And this has-- oh, I see.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:17.580]   You have to-- OK, you have to go through Bravo and then go into a Bravo Hangout.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.780]   I don't understand how it works.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:20.780]   Hello.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:21.780]   How are you?
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   Good to see you.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:23.780]   Oh, dang.
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:24.780]   There you go.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:32.780]   That one is here right now.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.780]   I don't--
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.780]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:38.780]   Well, while we're on Hangouts, can I do a plug?
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:39.780]   Would you please do something?
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:44.460]   Trey Harris, who's a wonderful, wonderful guy in the New York office of Google.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.020]   This is not under his Google--
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.020]   I like Trey a lot.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.020]   Yep.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.300]   Trey is just a great, great guy.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:54.380]   And he wants to play with Hangouts because he says that in his view, and I agree with
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.780]   him, the conversation on Google+ is good, but Hangouts are awkward.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.100]   They're often people just sitting there saying, so what's we talking about?
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.100]   Just doing.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.380]   You're putting up your bajamas there, Danny.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.340]   So he wants to have some kind of content around that.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:14.940]   So I'm very flattered that he's using as the first subject matter, Gutenberg the Geek,
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.940]   have a drink.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:16.940]   Oh, good.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.940]   And so--
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.100]   What is that going to be?
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.140]   If you go-- it'll be Sunday.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:27.780]   And if you go to at 4 o'clock Eastern, if you go to Google+ and search for plus T3W--
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.580]   That's plus T3W-- you'll see Trey's post about it.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.220]   It's an experiment.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:37.260]   And he wants to have the best, most intriguing commenters in the comments.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.500]   He will then invite in to the Hangout.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.820]   So it's not just kind of random who's coming in, and he'll manage it just enough and have
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.860]   a topic and content and see how it goes.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:47.860]   All right.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.860]   I'm going to give you a promo for it.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   Sunday.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.340]   Join Trey Harris as he talks about Gutenberg as he goes around 4 p.m.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.340]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.940]   The amazing Google Hangout and their sniketrofule funny cars.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.380]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.380]   Your face wet red.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.380]   That was great.
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:04.380]   Wow.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.380]   Wow.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.380]   I'm awake now.
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.740]   Did you used to have to do that for pay, Leo?
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.340]   Yeah, actually I have done this.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.340]   You did.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   I have done this as a job.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.340]   Wow.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.940]   I always wanted to meet a Sunday, Sunday, Sunday guy.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:20.940]   I just did.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:26.020]   Oh, it's those nitrofuelled funny cars.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.540]   Actually I'm funranium-fueled today.
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:33.420]   I have that new cold brewed coffee in my veins.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:38.940]   So what's been on Google+ Leo for a coffee maker, a espresso maker in your car?
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.940]   No, no.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.620]   She espresso uses hot water.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.820]   I'm all about the cold brewing now.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.820]   It's a whole new thing.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:51.620]   I have just purchased a Yama cold brewed drip tower.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.220]   It's so fancy.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.460]   Next time you come over, take a look at this.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.460]   Somebody take away his credit card.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.660]   This looks like paraphernalia.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.420]   It does.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.780]   That is paraphernalia baby.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.780]   Good coffee.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:09.100]   And you know, it's 200 bucks, which is expensive, but look, that's just the beginning.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.260]   But I like the brass fittings and stuff.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.660]   Doesn't that look like a way to make coffee?
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.300]   Oh, I'll assume before that's fine.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.460]   Is coffee out of that?
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.460]   13 hours later you get coffee out of that.
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.460]   That's the problem.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.580]   And then you used to heat the coffee up?
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.820]   You can't be in a hurry.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.820]   Slow coffee.
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.820]   But then...
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.420]   Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:33.260]   Watch Leo's head explode!
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:38.340]   As long as we got Danny here, he was an expert on search at searchengineland.com.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.780]   Let's ask him about Panda.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.780]   Oh God.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.780]   That's a lot.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780]   Okay.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.780]   Go go rolled out another...
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.780]   I'm not...
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.780]   I'm not...
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.780]   If not easy.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   What is it?
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.780]   What is Panda?
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.780]   No, you want to talk about something.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.540]   You got to talk about the new over-optimization penalty that's coming.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.100]   We did talk about that a couple of weeks ago.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.940]   Yeah, because Matt mentioned that.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.380]   You optimize too much.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.740]   You're going to get in trouble.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.740]   What do you think of that?
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.740]   I think it's bull.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.740]   Really?
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.100]   Well, but you're in this...
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.260]   Come on Danny, you're in the pocket of search engine optimizers everywhere.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.940]   No, I did a post on Tuesday and it was like, "Have they jumped the sharp with over-optimization?"
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:20.420]   Because I feel like, "Oh, we need to have yet another penalty.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.020]   You don't even enforce the penalties you have."
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:28.620]   Go do a search for SEO and look for any company that comes up.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:33.700]   Usually it's like SEO India or SEO, some geography.
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.500]   Then go do a backlink lookup and all you'll see are these links that are dropped in forums
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.220]   or blogs or templates or all these things that Google will tell you don't work.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.220]   They do work.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.220]   But they do work.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.220]   They do work.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.220]   Not only do they work, but they work for something like SEO, which you think Google would be
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.220]   watching like a hawk.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.220]   The first thing they'd fix.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.220]   Right.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:57.420]   But they can't fix that, which is a long-standing penalty, a long-standing no-no that they said,
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.420]   "You shouldn't be doing this blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:00.660]   But you know what we should do?
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:05.660]   We should have a super penalty because there's nothing better than when Google in November
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:10.340]   tells people that SEO isn't spam and SEO is actually something you should be doing.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:14.020]   There is actually stuff that you ought to be thinking about on your web page is good.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.380]   General best practices, good general things.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.540]   Not trying to screw with anybody's rankings like that.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.060]   You're just, "Can the search engines find your content?
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.220]   Is it well structured?
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.980]   Is it all these kinds of things?"
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:28.780]   Then they'll say, "But if you do too much of that, you'll get a penalty."
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.940]   But we won't tell you what too much of it is.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:35.060]   And actually what they're talking about is the idea that really you're just being spammy.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.300]   That's the core of what I don't like about it.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.500]   They've been fairly clear to explain that there's SEO and that there's spam and that
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.060]   there are two different things.
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:46.980]   Just like there's email marketing and there's spam mail and they're not necessarily the
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   same thing.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.620]   Then when you come out with this, well, we may be coming up with an over-optimization
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:56.540]   penalty, you confuse the two things together.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:01.700]   It felt to me much more like it was a nice PR thing to toss out because I guess maybe
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.180]   they've been feeling heat that people think, "Oh, I did this search result and all I get
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.780]   is this SEO garbage that comes up."
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.820]   It's not SEO garbage necessarily.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.220]   It could just be spam that Google didn't catch.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.620]   What you really need are better spam filters.
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:18.580]   I got some gripes with Matt on that particular subject.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.580]   Wow.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.580]   Start him up.
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.580]   It's a nitro-fuel day.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.580]   He's selling it.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.580]   That makes sense though, Danny.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.580]   I haven't even thought about that.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.580]   Yeah, I agree 100 percent.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:35.020]   It's so, and I think that Matt, and I didn't hear him talk about it on the show, I think
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.900]   he talked about it briefly.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:37.900]   It was on the panel.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.580]   We were doing it south by southwest.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.700]   That's actually what we talked about.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.980]   We have not had Matt on to talk about it since.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:48.460]   I think really what happens is what he is probably really talking about is if we see
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:52.340]   that you're spamming in multiple areas, we may be able to use that as a better thing.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:58.180]   I think he probably needs to think about a better way of saying it.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.940]   As for Panda, by the way, yeah, they made another update that's designed to try to catch
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.620]   content that they think is of low quality.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.820]   This is an ongoing process.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:07.820]   It doesn't end.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:13.180]   I keep trying to describe that Panda is like taking a strainer and you take all the content
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:17.100]   from the web and you dump it into the strainer and you shake it all up and you see what comes
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.260]   out and that's the good stuff and the stuff that it catches, that's the stuff that you
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.020]   go, "Oh, we don't want this to do as well."
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.380]   Then you realize when you get done that there were things that got through some of the holes
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.100]   in the strainer, you're like, "Okay, we're going to make a new strainer.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.540]   We're going to change it so that these things that are getting through don't get through."
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:36.780]   Some of the stuff that was getting caught that shouldn't have got caught will fix it.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.500]   You change that filter in your strainer and you switch it around.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.540]   Every three or four weeks they change the filter and they just did that again.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.380]   If you were getting caught by mistake, there's a chance you're going to be out.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.900]   If you fix the things that were probably wrong, maybe you'll get out and if you were getting
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.180]   by and you should have been caught, then maybe you'll get caught more with it.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.980]   A couple of quickies, some new services from Google.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:02.220]   I use a third party, I use a couple of third party commenting systems on Leoville.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.740]   I use JSKit's Echo.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.420]   We use Discuss, I think on one of our blogs.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.060]   Google, according to the next web, is going into the business.
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.380]   They're going to create a third party commenting platform.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.020]   Let me guess.
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.580]   It's going to be based on Google+.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   What a surprise.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.580]   Yes, it is.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.580]   It's everywhere.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.580]   You won't escape.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:23.580]   You cannot escape.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.780]   You cannot escape Google+.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:26.780]   Yet, you know what?
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.420]   I'll tell you why.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.420]   This is what bugs me.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.740]   There really is a lot of the same reason Lady Gaga joined Google+.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:37.860]   There's a lot of incentive now to use Google tools.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:41.980]   I feel bad for Discuss and LiveFire and all the other third party commenting systems because
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:42.980]   --
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:43.980]   Discuss is very good.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   I don't know why.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:45.980]   I love Discuss.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.100]   Of course, Facebook's been in this for a little while.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.500]   Their Facebook has a third party platform.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   Do they not?
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   Or are they going to?
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.260]   You can use Facebook comments and your comments can appear on Facebook and all that.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:02.980]   I like Discuss better because you can sign in with many identities, Facebook, Twitter
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:03.980]   and such.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.380]   That's why I use both JSCET and Echo.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:12.140]   The other thing is that they capture social media commenting outside of your blog and bring
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:17.380]   it back into the blog, which is always to me up in the serious advantage of that.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:22.140]   Also I keep hearing about Google Drive according to GigaOM.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:23.620]   It's coming next month.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:28.420]   Google Drive, their competitor for, I guess, I don't know, Dropbox.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:37.340]   Om Malek writing a couple of days ago says G Drive is coming April, first week of April
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.140]   2012, according to his sources.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.140]   Google's not talking.
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.140]   That's next week.
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:43.980]   I mean, but the story has come up.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.980]   I feel like every six months.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.980]   I know.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.900]   I don't want to -- if it weren't Om, I wouldn't say it.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.900]   But Om is Om.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.900]   Om is Om.
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:50.900]   Om Suite Om.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.620]   What's amazing is that they haven't rolled it out yet, but maybe they need to rename
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:57.060]   it Google+ Drive and take some time.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.060]   There you go.
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.060]   That's what's missing.
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.820]   Supposedly, according to the details from my sources, says Om, a gigabyte of storage
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.340]   for free, which is not much.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:12.940]   Dropbox offers two SkyDrive 25, local client and web interface that will look like Google
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940]   Docs.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:17.140]   I'm going to bet it's going to be more awkward than Dropbox.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.260]   I'm going to bet you're right.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.260]   I try to think of what I use.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:24.140]   I use -- what's the thing I use?
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.940]   They will have a third party -- Oh, live mesh.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.940]   Live mesh, yeah.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:30.060]   Nobody ever talks about live mesh, which I think is awesome.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.460]   I think I get five gigabytes on it.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:36.300]   That's because it's -- I believe it's been folded into -- it's so confusing.
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.740]   I think it's been folded into SkyDrive.
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.820]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:42.820]   It's weird.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.820]   But it's awesome.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.580]   I mean, I got one folder on my computer and anything I throw in that folder meshes -- and
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.580]   it's cross-platform.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.820]   It's Mac, AM, PC.
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:50.820]   No, I like mesh.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.820]   It's really beautiful.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:54.580]   I'm using it for a while, but I think it's SkyDrive.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:58.700]   And SkyDrive is 25 gigs, which is nice.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:02.660]   Supposedly, Google will have a third party API right up front for its Google Drive, which
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.340]   would be good.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:10.020]   The reason I think I keep using Dropbox, despite lots of reasons to use something else, it's
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.020]   expensive.
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:15.980]   There's the issue of -- there's no real privacy on it.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:17.220]   But it works with everything.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.300]   All these third party apps.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.180]   I bet to do text works with Dropbox, right?
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.820]   Yeah, to do text is integrated with Dropbox.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.820]   That's right.
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.820]   It's what everybody uses.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.020]   It's what everybody wanted first.
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:32.500]   And I presume that if Google did something that you would -- and it had a good API, you'd
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.020]   probably add that as a feature.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.020]   Yep.
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.020]   Yep.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.980]   Yeah, we want to make it so you can choose your cloud provider right now and just do Dropbox.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   But yeah.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.420]   I'm excited to see Google Drive, but I still don't believe it.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.660]   I mean, I believe oh, but I'm still, I feel like --
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.660]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.300]   -- it's supposed to come for a long time, but it's supposed to be next week.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.300]   So I'm excited.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:51.300]   Yep.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:55.100]   Pinterest, the president, is now on Pinterest.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.540]   It's real.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.220]   It's mainstream, baby.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.860]   I found a lovely frog today.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.460]   W -- I mean, just WTF.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:12.140]   There was a great photo of the president with a light saber on the White House lawn on
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   Pinterest.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.580]   I don't know if it was his account.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:19.020]   It's the president's campaign or it's the White House?
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.260]   Run by Obama for America, which is his campaign.
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:22.260]   Okay.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.260]   So it's the campaign.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.260]   Okay.
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:29.820]   Pet lovers for Obama, Obama-inspired recipes, Obama in action, Obama art, the first family.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.460]   Well, why not?
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.460]   Why not?
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:36.740]   It's all a story that I didn't put on the list of a guy who's been thinking thousands
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:38.300]   a day spamming Pinterest.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.300]   Right.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.460]   It's the easiest platform to spam.
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.460]   And he admits it.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.500]   He stepped up and stepped forward.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500]   So, Pinterest-ing.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   [laughter]
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.500]   Here's a plug from Jeff for --
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:54.940]   By the way, Leo, we just posted a story out on Marketing Land because they commented
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.260]   on it on the spam for us now formally.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.420]   And they said, "Yes, we're actively working to fight spam and it's a tremendous priority."
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.420]   Of course it is.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:03.420]   Tremendous.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.420]   Of course it is.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.620]   We've extended an offer to Matt Cutz.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:11.860]   And as soon as he joins our team, we will be fighting spam.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.420]   Matt McGee writing that article at MarketingLand.com.
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.740]   No, I made up the part about Matt Cutz.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.180]   But not the actively working.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.500]   It's a tremendous priority.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.340]   That's true.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.980]   This is what Pinterest spam looks like.
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:27.780]   This is the problem.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.780]   How can you tell?
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780]   You can't.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.580]   But he's spamming with affiliate links basically, right?
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   Right.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.580]   I think it's just brilliant.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.580]   I like that dress.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.860]   I would buy this.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.180]   So there you go.
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:45.380]   Because that will fit guys of all sizes.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.380]   But it's nicer than a movement.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.780]   It's a black number like that, yes.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.540]   Oh, you're looking at the little black number.
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:51.540]   Always.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.540]   I'm classical.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.540]   Classic.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.540]   A little string of pearls.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.700]   Here is Kickstarter, a web series project that you wanted to plug.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.940]   Let's give you your chance.
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.380]   Yeah, they came to me out of nowhere.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.380]   They're big twig fans.
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:05.060]   So they'll be all cheering right now.
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:12.180]   And they're making a web series fictional about a bad regulation and law that gets passed.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.420]   Oh, I like it.
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.420]   HR 9281.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:18.260]   They're going to deal interviews with folks like me as part of it.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.860]   And it looks very good.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.540]   And we, as they said, Hollywood will never do this story because Hollywood wrote soap
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.380]   and Pee-boo.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.460]   So I would urge folks to go to the picture.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:29.460]   I like this.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.460]   Look up free and open.
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.140]   And I think it's very, very neat.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.180]   They're trying to raise 52,000.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.780]   They're up to 6,127.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:41.500]   As you know, on Kickstarter, they have to raise their amount before your pledge is real.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.100]   27 days to go.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.740]   I think it's going to be a good web season.
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.700]   This is such a really an interesting way.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:50.580]   And I kind of wish Kickstarter had been around when I started Twig because this would be
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.060]   a much better way to launch shows.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.060]   Maybe I was going to ask you earlier.
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.660]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.740]   Game on, which is a gaming show that we launched.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:04.380]   We try to give it some high production values, costs us about $5,000 to $7,000 an episode.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.540]   We've done 12 episodes.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.380]   We're at $74,000 in.
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:15.260]   We would have loved to have had that funded because it's risky.
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:19.780]   The problem is, and I'm not sure I really like this, what is your reward for giving us
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780]   money?
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.580]   You get a show, right?
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.260]   Well, but there's various things.
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:28.700]   Yes, that's why I gave you this thing as I get a show, but I also get a t-shirt.
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:32.260]   And the other thing is, what am I doing right now?
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:35.100]   The real advantage they get isn't just the money, that's the key advantage, but it's
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.100]   also the promotion.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:40.220]   Because if you want it made, you're going to go tell friends and try to mow them into
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.220]   ...
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:43.700]   No, I understand the benefit to the producer is huge.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.140]   I just think it seems a little bit ... I mean, you're not really ... You're giving them money,
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.820]   but you're not really getting anything for your money.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:52.660]   No, no, no, but what I'm saying is that I feel as if I'm ... Well, if you give $2,500
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:56.060]   to this thing, you get a co-executive producer a credit.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.060]   Absolutely.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:02.440]   Yeah, you can't have to come up with credits or you burn it to a DVD and have Veronica
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.440]   whoever signed it.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.440]   You have to cut and get creative.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.340]   I think this market's going to collapse because ultimately people are going to realize I've
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:12.900]   bought several things on Kickstarter and I've never seen anything.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.940]   I think this market is going to collapse.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.540]   I think ... But I think that's where the next question comes is the law that's passing
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:23.980]   in Congress going through now to allow you to instead get equity at a low level, 1,000
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.980]   price.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.980]   That's the new jobs bill.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:27.580]   I can't remember the name of the company.
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:32.620]   There's a company that in the UK where it is legal and encouraged under tax law for
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.460]   people to invest at a low level.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:36.900]   Kevin, Mark says I'm dead wrong.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.500]   The Kickstarter's ... There's a lot of good stuff being done by Kickstarter.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:45.140]   I just feel like there is this impression people are getting that they're getting something
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.540]   for their money and really they're just giving people money.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.340]   Oh, no, I'm really well free by something.
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:52.140]   No, you get to get a discount on things.
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.980]   The first thing I did was the Obama design book.
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:55.740]   I bought it for $50.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.100]   It was then sold for $80.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.620]   So I got something very real tangible.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.620]   I got a discount.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:05.660]   I bought the iPod watch band and I was just rebying it at a discount and I got it and
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.100]   I was pleased with it and I felt part of something.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.780]   I guess it's my fault.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:14.860]   I supported things that I ... Like some gaming dice I still haven't seen.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.420]   Well, that's not your fault.
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:20.500]   I have found the projects that I've also still kind of waiting to get the thing that
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.860]   they promised and I'm kind of hoping that there's just a delay and I might not see it.
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:24.860]   I got this deep thing.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.900]   That's part of the risk.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.100]   This is a game.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.980]   Start up fever with parts and boards and everything that I got from my entrepreneurial students.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.820]   But I thought it was really cool to turn starting businesses into a game and by God,
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.660]   they've got it made and here it is.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.580]   Well then I understand.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:43.580]   I'm just saying for investing in television shows, I mean I want free and open it.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.580]   That's where you go.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:49.420]   Yeah, I think that's ... But then it was 20% of Sundance funding.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:51.420]   No, no.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.420]   I mean it's just the idea.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.420]   Look, I buy TV show.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.420]   I bought Mad Men.
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.420]   These are right.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.420]   I'm so excited, right?
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:59.140]   And I guess if I knew Mad Men were going to be that good before they produced it, I would
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.540]   have said, "Hey, here's a hundred bucks.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.540]   That's great."
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.540]   But I didn't know.
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.540]   How do you know?
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:04.540]   No, you don't.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.540]   Well, Twit hasn't established.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.780]   I mean, I back Zafranx, the show is good.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.780]   Yeah, that was good.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:10.780]   I would support that.
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.780]   Right, because Zay is great.
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.620]   Twit has a track record for shipping great shows.
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.780]   So if you put something on Kickstarter, I think people would know.
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:20.540]   I mean, it works much better for people who are well known and have done great work and
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.460]   have proved that they.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:24.260]   We tried to get the, we actually tried to kick started.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.900]   We tried to get on, but they said no.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:27.900]   Really?
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.900]   Because it's a commercial.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:30.900]   There are some rules around.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:31.900]   We wanted to do the bricks.
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.900]   You know, we wanted to do the bricks.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:33.900]   The bricks sales.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:34.900]   The fun reason.
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:38.540]   You see, Leo, if somebody gave, if you're going to start a new show, I'm just giving
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.660]   an example, and you want to come up with the benefits.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.700]   Let's say that somebody gave two grand.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.460]   Would you let them in the official show hang out that you would upgrade the way you
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:49.460]   have?
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:50.460]   Yeah, but of course.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.460]   Think of premiums.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.460]   Can't.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.460]   Okay.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:57.100]   I don't know.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.580]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:03.740]   We're going to stick with our model, which is I read a commercial.
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.740]   God bless them.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:08.340]   Thank goodness we got great advertisers who do believe in our product.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.020]   You know, and it is in a similar way, but I mean, they get something for it.
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:16.220]   They get an ad for a product and presume, and they don't buy ads if they don't get a
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.460]   return on their investment.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.660]   So it's kind of, it just feels to me like a clean transaction.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:22.460]   It's like, yeah, I've got this great audience.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.420]   You've got something that they might be interested in.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.420]   Let me tell them about it.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.260]   And if they are interested in it and they buy it in sufficient numbers, then you will
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.500]   continue to buy ads.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.580]   It's very straightforward.
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.020]   And this is a good example.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:38.300]   Stamps.com, which I've been a user.
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.420]   Most of almost all of our advertisers, I think, in fact, I think all of them I use.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:48.900]   It's part of the criteria for being an advertiser on our shows is I got to use it.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:53.580]   And I've been using Stamps since, I think, 2004.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.580]   The whole idea of Stamps.com is you don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:00.820]   If that's really all I should have to say, you don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:01.820]   That's good.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.380]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:09.420]   You bring the post office to your desk, and that means you can print any postage for anything,
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.540]   get international from your computer and your printer.
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:13.540]   No special link.
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:14.780]   You don't need a postage meter.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.700]   Are you using a postage meter?
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:22.060]   Why go to Stamps.com right now and print your postage as needed.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.300]   In fact, I've got to-- see, there's a special offer.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.300]   Don't do that.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:27.300]   Click the microphone.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.300]   I don't know.
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.300]   That old-fashioned microphone.
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.780]   And use the offer code TWIG.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:34.180]   And look what happens to that $80 special offer.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:37.020]   It becomes a $110 special offer.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:38.740]   How do you like that?
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:43.820]   $5 in free postage, this USB scale, and a four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.140]   All you have to do is pay shipping and handling.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:51.260]   And I got to tell you, for international, they fill out the forms for you.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.820]   Going-- mailing something internationally like is a real chore.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.420]   You got to go to the post office, figure it all out.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:00.860]   If you're an Amazon seller and eBay seller, this is a boon.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.900]   If you're a small business, this is how we use it.
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:04.300]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.300]   Stamps.com.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.740]   A $110 bonus offer.
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:12.180]   All you have to do is go to Stamps.com and use the offer code TWIG.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:18.380]   Over 2 billion letters and packages have been mailed to date from Stamps.com.

[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:25.540]   book, things like that.
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.540]   It makes it very easy to do invoices.
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:27.540]   It's just really nice.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.620]   Stamps.com use the offer code TWIG.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.740]   See, I don't-- to me, that's like-- I like that.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.500]   It's a clean transaction.
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.500]   They like us.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.780]   We like them.
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:37.780]   You might like them.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.860]   You would use them, if not.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.340]   No big deal.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.340]   All right.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.980]   It's time for our tip, number, and tool of the week.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:48.980]   Let's start with, as we always do, Gina Trapani.
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:53.580]   Google added a new beta feature to the accounts area of your Google account.
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.140]   It's called account activity.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:58.660]   It gives you stats about what you do using Google services.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.660]   Ooh.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.420]   So this is pretty cool.
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.420]   I checked it out.
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:09.060]   You turn it on, you go to it's Google.com/settings/activity, I think.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.700]   And you have to opt into this.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.060]   You have to opt into it, right?
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.260]   And it's beta.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.180]   And basically what they do is it generates reports about your activity.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:19.780]   So for example, I just opted into this earlier today and I got my first report and it told
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:25.340]   me that I received 2,100 emails in the past month.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.340]   And I wrote 114.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.340]   Oh, wow.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:32.100]   And it listed the people who I contact the most and how many messages I sent them next
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.100]   to it.
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:37.220]   So it's kind of a neat, kind of this quantified self kind of thing, but based on your online
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.220]   activity.
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:40.860]   So it's similar to the dashboard.
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:44.460]   Here's the all the information we have about you, but showing you stats and analytics.
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:45.860]   So I really like this.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.180]   I use Rescue Time.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:50.380]   I think I've mentioned this before, which kind of monitors what you do in your computer.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:51.380]   And this is kind of similar.
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:54.740]   I mean, it doesn't give you a productivity score or anything, but it kind of lets you
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:59.340]   see like, okay, I sent an average of four emails a day and I received 71.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:01.020]   That's something I didn't realize before.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:06.740]   And it's got stats on your web history, Picasa Web albums, where you sign in from your accounts
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:07.740]   and using what products.
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:12.980]   So I've signed in from Android, iPhone, and Mac on mobile and Chrome, what locations, what
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:13.980]   countries and locations.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.340]   So it's really interesting.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:18.740]   So not only is it kind of like interesting information about yourself, but it's also
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:22.780]   kind of a good account security thing because you can kind of review, you know, where people
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:26.100]   logging into my accounts is or anything here that looks unusual.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:28.460]   As well as you can say, oh, you know, maybe I should spend a little less time writing
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.900]   email or a little more time writing either way.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.300]   Let's compare Gina.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:37.140]   I received 4,231 emails and sent 703.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:41.380]   Whoa, wow, you're way ahead of me, way ahead of me.
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:44.940]   It should have like an email to incoming to outgoing ratio.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.340]   Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.180]   And a goal, like your goal.
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.180]   I want a 7.3 ratio.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:52.940]   I mean, you know, if you sign up to a bunch of mailing lists and you automatically archive
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:57.340]   and label them, which I, which I do, you know, it's not really representative of every email
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:01.300]   that's just sent just to you, but the email sent stats are pretty good.
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:04.140]   So you said 700 emails last month to Jeff.
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.140]   That's a lot.
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:06.980]   He spent a lot of time emailing.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.700]   I mean, I'm really bad at it.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.900]   There you go.
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.140]   I want stats about how at length of email, like I want even more, you know, it's like
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.540]   how many words did I type into the Gmail compose box?
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:21.340]   Yeah, you're going to tell us something you sent Gina.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:22.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.620]   Are you going to tell us how many you sent?
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.580]   I sent 114 in the past month.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580]   So not very many.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   She's a slacker.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   I mean, on average, like four days.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.020]   Oh, a few in precious words.
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.300]   I mean, part of my job is answering messages on a mailing list.
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.500]   I run an open source project.
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.300]   So I thought that it would be a lot more than that.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.500]   I don't have a big slacker.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.060]   Lacker.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:43.220]   You know, we're data nerds.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:46.780]   And I think every, you know, I can't wait to find out my body metrics and everything.
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:48.740]   I just want it all in one big dashboard.
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.740]   It's true.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.100]   You know, your heart beats per email sent.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.100]   All right.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.100]   It's pretty.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:55.100]   Yes.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.100]   I want to hook up an Arduino board.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.980]   I measure my heart rate and my breathing.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:02.180]   You know, Linda's telling me that thing about how you don't breathe when you're on your
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:03.180]   computer.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.340]   I want to know my blood pressure, my heart beats, my breathing.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.660]   I was dressed out.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.660]   I am someone.
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:09.820]   You know, rage emailing.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:10.820]   I'll know.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.820]   Oh my God.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.660]   I was doing that today.
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.260]   Don't we all rage email.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.260]   Wow.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:20.260]   I know you have another tip.
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:21.260]   Gina, save it.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.260]   You're an overachiever.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.260]   Just save it because we got it.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.260]   We're running at a time.
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:26.500]   Jeff Jarvis is number of the week.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:31.980]   All right, Leo, if you go down on the list to 200,000 miles driven by the Google car
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.660]   safely and they made a video of this.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.980]   And I suggest we just watch it to the point where the man gets into the parking.
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:38.980]   All 200 miles.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.180]   I mean, 200,000 miles.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.820]   Oh, this is the guy.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:43.820]   Is this a Google car driver?
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.580]   No, this is just a guy.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   Just watch.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.580]   Okay.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.580]   Well, just why.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:52.220]   Oh, there's the Google autonomous vehicle with the LiDAR on the roof.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:55.020]   The door should just open because they know a guy's coming to get in.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.020]   Okay.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.020]   Hello.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.020]   Welcome.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.980]   I'm your Google car.
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:04.740]   I'd like to drive you today.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:05.740]   Auto driving.
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:06.740]   Auto driving.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:08.460]   Where did he go?
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.020]   Look, he's gripping.
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:11.020]   That is so eerie.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:12.020]   It is eerie.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:13.020]   He's gripping that thing.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:14.900]   Oh, I mean, I'd be so nervous that the speed is going.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:17.420]   You can't react fast enough to.
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.220]   Holy crap.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.780]   I want to try this.
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:21.780]   Do you?
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:22.780]   That's the greatest thing on earth.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.860]   It seems scarier than going into space.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.060]   I kind of feel the way about this about skydiving.
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:30.860]   You know, like, I know that she'll be safe, but I'm terrified.
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:32.860]   She still really want to try it.
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.060]   They had it that last year.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.500]   Ted, they had it where you could go out and I went in it.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:40.260]   And they actually, and I've got a video up on our search engine on that channel, but
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.100]   they actually took off all the safeties.
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:46.140]   So it was an apartment lot and it's screaming around this parking lot.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.900]   Like 30 miles an hour.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.900]   And it's always.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.900]   Look, it's really.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.180]   It's pulling into a parking lot.
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.860]   No, it's going to go first to get a burrito.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:00.580]   It can navigate Taco Bell.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.860]   It's not great.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.860]   It knows about.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.940]   It knows about fourth supper.
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:06.940]   Very well.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:07.940]   How are you?
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:08.940]   Fourth supper.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.940]   What is it?
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:10.940]   What do they call it?
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   It's not the punch line.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.940]   No, wait until it's fourth meal.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:13.940]   It knows about fourth meal.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:14.940]   Where's he going?
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:15.940]   This trip club next?
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:16.940]   You'll see.
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:17.940]   No, no, no.
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:18.940]   No.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:19.860]   Thank you.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.860]   Soon.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.860]   Oh, but don't.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.860]   Hello.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:24.860]   Hi, neighbor.
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:25.860]   Nice man.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:26.860]   I'm not driving.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:27.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:28.860]   It's a handicapped spot.
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:29.860]   Well, look.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.860]   Oh, he's blind.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:31.860]   Oh, my God.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.860]   Isn't that the greatest thing?
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.860]   Oh, my God.
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:36.860]   Okay.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.860]   Great reveal.
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.860]   Wow.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:40.860]   Isn't that wonderful?
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:44.860]   Yeah, except that I think everything we just saw was illegal.
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:47.860]   I don't think blind people should be sitting at the wheel.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:50.860]   No, you can't drive a...
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.860]   Somebody have to be behind the wheel and be able to be in control of that car.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.860]   Well, he says he's...
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.860]   You're going to be driving a little bit.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.860]   He's eating a burrito while he drives.
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.860]   Holy cow.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.860]   That's still the greatest thing on it.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:05.860]   Okay.
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:06.860]   Yeah, because he drew...
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:07.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:08.860]   That's a handicapped lot.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.860]   Exactly.
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:10.860]   That's why I said two.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:11.860]   I was going to make fun of the car.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:12.860]   Wow.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.860]   There he goes.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.860]   Okay.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:17.860]   If you're blind, you can drive.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:20.860]   You can use a self-driving car.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:22.860]   Number one, he was the very first.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:23.860]   That is in Morgan Hill.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.860]   Wow.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:25.860]   That is quite beautiful.
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:26.860]   That is...
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:27.860]   That's a powerful video.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:29.860]   Thanks, Jeff.
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:30.860]   Wow.
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:31.860]   I don't know what to say.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:33.860]   I know my brain feels kind of scrambled by all that.
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:35.860]   That's pretty neat.
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:36.860]   I'm all four autonomous vehicles.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.860]   I can't wait.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:38.860]   I am too.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:39.860]   It will be safer.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.860]   The carrying capacity of the highways will be better.
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:43.860]   There's a lot of efficiency.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.860]   I was just thinking about this.
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:45.860]   Think of all the gas we'll save.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.860]   How many times can you drive around the block lane for a parking spot?
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:49.860]   You don't have to do that anymore.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.860]   You just get out of the car and you say, "Go home."
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.860]   And it just...
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860]   I like that.
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.860]   Right?
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:59.860]   In fact, you don't even personal ownership of cars, which is a huge environmental impact.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:00.860]   Why?
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:01.860]   Ridiculous.
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:02.860]   Goes away.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.860]   Car.
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.860]   Prager.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:05.860]   Exactly.
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:06.860]   You can...
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.860]   There's no more personal ownership of cars.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.860]   That was a reference no one would get out.
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.860]   Trigger.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.860]   Hail Silver.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:13.860]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.860]   You know who's Trigger?
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:17.860]   A horse or something?
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:18.860]   A dog?
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:19.860]   Super Roger's horse.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.860]   He's stuffed.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:21.860]   Right right a horse.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:22.860]   Yes.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:23.860]   Right next to Dale.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:29.860]   So my tool of the week is something that I'm going to bring down.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:32.860]   I tweeted about it this morning and I already brought their server down once.
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:33.860]   So let's do it again.
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:34.860]   What do you say?
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.860]   A lot of people feel jealousy.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.860]   It's on the Android phone.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.860]   A lot of people feel jealousy over the fact that Instagram is only available on iPhone.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:45.860]   It will, they'd say, soon be available as they've been saying for months on Android.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:47.660]   But you know what?
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:48.660]   Good news.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.740]   There is now something better than Instagram.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:55.540]   It is both iOS and Android and the web, which is one reason it's better because Instagram's
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.460]   never had a good web interface.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:59.260]   It's called I-M-E-Y-E-M.com.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:02.020]   Do you have it over the shoulder?
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.660]   There it is.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:07.820]   And so the whole idea of Instagram and other programs like this is you take a picture.
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.380]   In fact, let me do one.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.980]   I'll do one right now of you, Gina.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.940]   Let's just take a picture of Gina.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:16.460]   I'll show you the UI is so slick.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.140]   So I've taken a picture of Gina.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:22.260]   Now one of the things that Instagram became famous for was all its filters.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:23.540]   There are some really great filters.
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:24.540]   And look at this.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:28.420]   You swipe to change filters, which Instagram does not do.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:29.860]   So pick a filter that you like.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:30.860]   That's a little blown out.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.860]   Let's see.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.820]   They've got a couple of really good black and white filters.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.820]   So you see, that's a nice one.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:36.820]   How about that?
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:37.820]   Cool.
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:40.380]   I can also pick a frame.
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:41.380]   Same thing.
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:42.980]   Swipe to change frames.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.660]   So let's actually, let me just do this fast.
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.140]   Okay, there's a frame.
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:49.860]   Let's say hello to that.
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:51.620]   And now this is the fun part.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.380]   Now I can say, I can tag it.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.860]   It already knows I'm at the Brickhouse Studio.
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:56.860]   So I'll keep that.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:59.660]   But if I tip this, I can go through other things.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.620]   Chad, Realm, here's all the locations.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.700]   These are all four square style locations.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.820]   I'll go back to the Twit Brickhouse Studios.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:06.820]   This is what I like.
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:08.260]   These are activities.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.980]   So I can, great performance, watching, interesting exhibition.
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:15.060]   I'm watching Gina, but I can type in something.
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.140]   And these become albums.
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:21.500]   So I'm now watching at the Twit Brickhouse Studio, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr,
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:22.500]   and four square uploads.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.820]   So I'll do four square and Facebook upload.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.940]   And what I love is now there is a watching folder.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:34.180]   And this will join the watching folder for other people who are watching.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.980]   And I can also see this place is--
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:36.980]   Delicious of life.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:39.780]   So this is happening near you.
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:40.940]   This place is near you.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:43.860]   So I'm seeing all the pictures in the Twit Brickhouse Studio.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.780]   And these are some albums, Green, Petaluma.
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:50.140]   I've favorited a few on the road, breakfast, dreaming.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:52.620]   So this is, I think this is very elegant.
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.960]   And I think they have a very nice web page that also supports this.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:58.500]   It does, of course, support friends, but nobody's using it yet.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.060]   So I thought I'd tell you about it.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.500]   It has popular, which is very much like Instagram.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.540]   This is called I-M-E-Y-E-M.
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:10.540]   And it, frankly, is now giving us parody on Android to Instagram, which has been iOS only.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:12.900]   It is also on iOS, so I think it's going to do very well.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.860]   And no, there's no Google+ integration.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:17.420]   Another great feature.
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:18.780]   Oh, ow.
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.460]   Ow, no, I'm not bitter.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:21.060]   I'm not bitter.
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:22.060]   I'm really not.
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:22.580]   I'm not.
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:25.140]   In fact, I'm surprised it doesn't have Google+ integration, but I'm sure.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:27.900]   If it had a right API, it would.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:31.620]   So now I can make ordinary photos look like terrible Polaroid photos.
[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:32.140]   Yes.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.140]   And it's on Android.
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.140]   Exactly.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:36.860]   Finally, actually, there's about 14 very nice filters.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:40.500]   And you can change history and fictionalized reality.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:44.060]   And it has features of color, highlight, and other things.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:48.100]   So you can see who's taking pictures near you, what's happening near you.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.220]   I have a folder that's Petaluma.
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.500]   These are all pictures been taken at Petaluma.
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:53.980]   This is, it says, "This is my city."
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:54.980]   So this is fun.
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:57.300]   I just think they've done a nice job with that.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:59.420]   Black and white photos are really spectacular.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.500]   Oh, by the way, when you're looking at a photo, they use the-- I would look at this Gina as
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:08.860]   a developer because they use the UI, I think, very nicely.
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:12.620]   When you're looking at a photo, you can swipe and it starts doing a slideshow.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.620]   So there's--
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.620]   Yeah, that's very nice.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:16.620]   It's now-- you see how slow it is?
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.620]   We've brought it down.
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.620]   You've brought it down.
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.620]   Yeah, I'm installing this right now.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:20.620]   It looks really--
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:21.620]   Yeah, see that?
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.940]   That's because we're all using it at the same time.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:25.900]   It is normally fairly snappy.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.940]   So you waited to say the name until you were done?
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:28.940]   I did.
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.620]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:32.620]   We broke the system.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.220]   It has a web interface that's good too.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:35.780]   E-Y-E-E-M.com.
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:36.780]   There we go.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.780]   That's it.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:38.780]   We are out of time.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:39.780]   It's 3 o'clock.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.780]   Perfect.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:44.060]   I want to thank Danny Sullivan, Search Engine Land.com and Marketing Land.com.
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:45.060]   Thank you.
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:47.260]   Any other lands you want to specify?
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.260]   Two lands.
[01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:49.260]   Two lands is enough.
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:50.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.340]   He's the king of two kingdoms, the United Kingdom and the Danny Kingdom.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.860]   Thank you, Danny.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:56.860]   Great to have you.
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:57.860]   Thank you.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.860]   Always nice to have your insight.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.340]   Jeff Jarvis is going to be Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:06.140]   Part of a focus of a hangout that Trey Harris is doing.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:09.380]   If you want to know more about that, you can go to Google+ and search.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:11.780]   What is the search term, Jeff?
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:14.940]   T-3-W, plus T-3-W.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:16.900]   And you're just going to help Trey Harris.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:17.900]   You'll see it there.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:20.620]   Look at me and find it and get in the discussion and then join in.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.660]   It's about drinking time.
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:23.860]   Gutenberg the Geek.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:24.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:29.140]   So it's a T-3-W is a Google+ page.
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:33.140]   Page that he created for this experiment and trying to create basically the Charlie Rose
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.140]   of Google+.
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.140]   Wow.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:36.140]   And is he the Charlie Rose?
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140]   He's the Charlie Rose.
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:38.140]   Wow.
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.140]   Good for him.
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:40.140]   Good for him.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:41.140]   He's a great guy, Trey.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:42.580]   4 PM Eastern.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:46.140]   He was incredibly organized going through this stuff with me and trying to-- and I said,
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:48.540]   "My God, Danny, I need you to run my life."
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:52.140]   And he laughed and he said, "Well, I was a Cisidman and an Eagle Scout."
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.140]   Was he?
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.140]   OK.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.020]   He's so organized, he's just brilliant.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.140]   I think I have the wrong T-3-W.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:00.140]   It's all in Arabic.
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.700]   Let me see if I can find the right-- oh, there's two T-3-W's.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:06.860]   That's why-- look for the one where the logo is T-3-W.
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:09.860]   It says, "An experiment in conversations live online."
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:11.460]   This is why I'm excited about Hangouts.
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:15.740]   I know you don't like them, Danny, but I think this empowers everyday people to become
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:16.740]   broadcasters.
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.740]   And I think this is really interesting.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:21.660]   Yeah, this would be live and it becomes-- he was concerned.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:24.820]   He didn't want to worry you, Leo, on this.
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.500]   I said, "No, Leo loves opening us all around."
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:27.500]   No, that's great.
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:28.500]   That's great.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.660]   I'm following it right now.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:33.900]   And it's right against me in the radio show, but that's OK.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:34.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:38.460]   This is why we can record things.
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.460]   My radio show--
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:40.980]   This way I can watch Twitch then.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.540]   Yeah, it's not-- doesn't compete with Twitch, thank goodness.
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:46.300]   But I don't think the radio show people even know what Hangout is.
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:48.220]   So Jeff is at the City University of New York.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.620]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:54.580]   His book is "Public Parts You Must Buy It Now," as well as Gutenberg the Geek in Amazon
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.580]   single for $0.99.
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:00.860]   In fact, you have to buy that before you watch the show on Sunday.
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:03.420]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:09.540]   Don't forget to vote for Think Up in the Night Challenge on Tumblr.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.380]   Just heart it.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:14.820]   And we want to-- actually, we should just go to Tumblr and see--
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:15.820]   Yeah, give me a heart.
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:16.820]   Give me a heart.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:18.820]   Thank you so much for everyone who's who hearted it during the show.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:20.220]   I think we're up 200 hearts.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:21.220]   Oh, really?
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.220]   Just past 30 minutes.
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:23.220]   So thank you so much.
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.020]   A doubling of hearts.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:26.420]   Enjoy the discussion there, folks.
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.820]   You have smart things to add to it.
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:28.340]   Uh-huh.
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.220]   Night loves that.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.020]   Yes.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:32.740]   They're looking for engagement, not merely hearts.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.260]   It's true.
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:33.740]   That's true.
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:40.100]   So yeah, there's a great comments thread actually going on below saying how we're crazy.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.540]   But we might have a shot.
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.340]   So I'm in.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.780]   My favorite.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.060]   Crazy, but might have a shot.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:50.020]   I feel like, you know, whenever someone's telling you that the thing you're trying to do is too
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:52.460]   hard or can't be done, that makes you want to do it more.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.940]   So bring it on, people.
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:58.140]   Gina's also a blogger at smarterware.org.
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:59.300]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:04.180]   We do this show every Wednesday at 1 p.m. civic 4 p.m. eastern at twit.tv.
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.180]   Watch live if you can.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:06.180]   It's always great to have you in the chat room.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:11.380]   But if you can't, of course, we make audio and video available after the fact at twit.tv.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:16.620]   TNT, our daily news show, is coming up next with Tom Merritt, IAS, ACTAR.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:19.100]   And Sarah Lane, IAS on the back.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.100]   It's his one year anniversary.
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:22.100]   One day.
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.100]   Hello.
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:24.100]   That's your anniversary.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.900]   Twitter, it's his Twitter, Twitter.
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:27.900]   Twitter.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.340]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:31.500]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:41.500]   [MUSIC]
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:44.060]   (gentle music)
