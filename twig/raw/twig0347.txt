[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.460]   Some Twitter maybe even a little medium thrown in joining me right now
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.100]   My good my good buddy and professor of journalism at the City University of New York. It's Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.860]   From hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Facebook live. We're trying something Facebook live
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.340]   You're only hearing half the conversation here, but um they should be hearing the whole thing on where we have the room lead on here
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.740]   So they should you go to Facebook live people? I want you to watch me cuz I know I have no watch me
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.460]   I have both audio streams. I want 252 viewers
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.100]   I have 826 viewers
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.540]   Your fingers are longer than mine
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:00.540]   So this is the new this they turn this on today, right? And Mark Zuckerberg did a live feed of it
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.480]   Chris Cox did two live feeds. He's I see he was just all on with
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.660]   Jorge Ramos and he's the guy behind it. I think Chris Cox is yeah
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.380]   Great well and and much much much much credit here to Fiji Simone
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.540]   Seamull who is the head of she does all kinds of products done off including new stuff
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.060]   But she's been really absolutely nose to the grindstone since she got back from a maternity leave on video
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.740]   Now you might say this is a herb job with this
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.540]   It's just a me to product
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.260]   I mean cuz this is mere cat and periscope kind of did this to in fact Facebook even did this Facebook mentions which was available only to the
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.880]   Which camera should I should look at this camera Facebook mentions which was available only to the
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.500]   Girati for some time and then was open to the public but you had to use a separate application then they put it in Facebook
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   But this is different. This is more like
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.380]   mere cat or periscope because you could see we've got comments going
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.140]   scrolling up here and I can I can I can do a thumbs up on a comment
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.060]   We also have up here account and it's live and I should point out I'm doing this on an iPad because you need iOS to do it
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.980]   It's not available on Android yet
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.420]   But it does work on the iPad and I should point out that
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.940]   It's rock solid if you saw I mean even periscope and he was working for you too, right?
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.740]   Jeff well show show me a show you you have a do you have your feet laptop screen? Yeah?
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.260]   So go to your laptop screen you get me as if I'm on now compare the quality of that now go to me on
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.820]   There now look how much better the you look better
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.300]   Less big I am and more human and flesh colored on Facebook live then on Skype now
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.020]   What are you using? I thought you didn't have an iPhone right? So I'm using my my Nexus 6p the front-facing
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.300]   Oh, so it does work on Android. I'm using mentions. Oh, cuz you're using the old the old product which has been upgraded
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.620]   It looks like yours. Yeah, they've upgraded it then yeah, but yeah
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.100]   Skype is so much worse
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.220]   But it's cuz I'll tell you why cuz Skype's doing it in real time in fact we have to use Skype so that you and I can converse
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.740]   True in real time. This is not a conversation medium. There is about five ten seconds
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.860]   Like if you go go to the post that announces all the new features one is they're gonna
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.580]   Well allow well least at least you can do video to a closed group
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.780]   I don't know if you can do group talk or not so that's the this is competing more than with just periscope and meerkat
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780]   This is also competing with Facebook's hangouts
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.820]   If it's Google's hangouts. I'm sorry Google hangouts. Wow. That's very interesting
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.180]   Thanks a lot for groups in advance. Oh, maybe it's just - well, you know who's using it right now
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.620]   It's kind of timely Loik La Mer who of course is good friend
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.860]   entrepreneur founder of seismic which was you know video messaging he he did a conference for years called La Web in Paris
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.620]   And he sold that he's now doing a new conference called leaders LEAD ER
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.580]   LEAD E. Dot RS and
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.700]   He's he's been streaming today from his leaders conference in Paris
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.180]   with some big names to read Hoffman
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.740]   so
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:18.020]   Le Week it's an interesting way to do a conference, isn't it? It really is it really is especially since he charged like 800 bucks to go
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.020]   See to go in person
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.460]   But you'd probably prefer to go in person because you got a chance to network and meet people in this
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.980]   I think this is a great way to promote an event
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.620]   We've I mean look at everybody's now doing that Google streams most of IO face
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.540]   Microsoft just stream most of build of course there
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.620]   You still have an incentive to pay thousands of dollars to go and do it in person
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.740]   But if you can't it's just moves, but if you can't this makes sense for conferences
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.100]   He had Phil Libbon on the founder of Evernote who's now become a venture capitalist. That was earlier today
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.220]   Pretty impressive. You could also broadcast just to a group
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.380]   So like a closed group you can invite a group of Facebook events. You know why they do that though
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.860]   They do that for family, right?
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.500]   I would imagine but also companies don't forget Facebook for work. They're trying to push that
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.460]   You know what Loic is not doing this as leaders. He's as part of his leaders conference. That's not till next month
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.460]   This is promotional
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.740]   For his leaders conference, so he sat down with Phil and they're doing a teaser
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.780]   And he's used he used mentions for this
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.740]   So is it I mean look at a mere cat went went bad
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.820]   Periscope, I don't see a huge adoption. I don't see a lot of periscope videos in my Twitter timeline
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.660]   Why is this better? Why is this gonna do better than that or even hangouts Google's power of Facebook? Yeah
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.220]   Right, I mean I think I think that I these are people my friends. I'll get a notification. I'll see what's what
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.540]   The fact that you can do it to a group I think is interesting what I do this and the problem is this is not hangouts
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.540]   Yeah, but it's not gonna take much for them to do that
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.100]   And then you also saw they have a Facebook live map
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.940]   Journalistically if something starts going on in the world
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.020]   You know you can go and find people who are broadcasting live from events in that location
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.580]   Journalistically, that'll be huge if you go to the the post Leo the Facebook post the first mention
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.860]   Down the page you'll see the Facebook live map. Oh
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.580]   That's interesting
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.940]   Isn't it now stop live? I don't know how live it is now
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.620]   They don't promote every video that's on they just promoted some videos
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.420]   Well that was one of the cool things about periscope as you could see a map of all the different
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.900]   Periscopes and you know join other people's periscopes and so forth the idea
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:40.020]   No, no, I click on you. I click on what looks like California there you are Leo. Hey California. Hello. Yeah, good to see you
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:47.300]   But it's telling me that you're live now. Yeah, I can click around the world and go to different live. That's kind of fun to
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.420]   Elmo's Cara is now live
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.860]   That's periscope did this to triplet is now live, but I I wonder I think one of the cool things about this is
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.660]   I remember when I was a kid. I used to listen to
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.700]   Shorthwave radio
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.860]   My god, it's come a long way in the intervening 50 years, but I was so cool. I could listen and hear
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.420]   Listening the Moscow go to Moscow. Yeah, and now it's now
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:23.140]   Yeah, I can watch a video from somebody in St. Petersburg showing you know, I mean and it's nothing else El Hough is live right now from Senegal
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.460]   Wow
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:32.420]   Stefano proceda is live right now from somewhere in the middle of Spain along with Aline Giuseppe
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.980]   how long it's
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.220]   Amazing how long before
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:44.140]   Facebook puts this in the right hand column where it shows, you know trending I know so mouse over any one of those dots
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.500]   You sure you'll find you on there there. I am you are
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.900]   And it's showing all the people who are watching you and where they're watching from that. Oh look at that
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   So it's drawing a line
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.140]   Oh, man, two people are watching us in Hawaii
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.660]   South America Wow we are getting a
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.340]   Hello, hello, Southeast Asia
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.140]   Look at that
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.860]   Wow Australia three people in Australia one in Perth
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.860]   Wow, that is really cool
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.380]   That is really not know where do I find the map again?
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.020]   go to
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:29.780]   Go to the Facebook post go to Facebook live map. It's Facebook.com slash slash live map. Okay, Facebook.com slash live map Wow
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.580]   So this shows the power of Facebook really because
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:42.100]   They can they've got the servers. They've got the the community. They've got the network. They've got everything and they could put that together
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:48.780]   Fairly instantaneously, right? Geez. Oh, did they worry about the content?
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:55.900]   You know what I'm saying, I mean, oh, yeah, well, let me show you Leo
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.700]   Please don't
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.900]   Yeah, of course they're going to and I wonder what they're doing about that
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.660]   I don't know if anybody asked Chris talks about that today
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.620]   It's the real names thing is gonna help a little bit, right?
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   Yeah, because they're yeah, if you if you if you mucked up notice I use an M there sort of right if it's
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.900]   Muck up. Yeah, they'll kill your account, right?
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.740]   Yes, so you don't want to you want to use this in a responsible fashion
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.580]   What there would be no advantage
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.580]   I'm still streaming by the way
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.580]   I'm still streaming to the poor people and by the way, if those of you were here all
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.340]   271 on the base Leo this is the twig broadcast you can go to twit.tv slash
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.940]   Five yeah, and you'll see the real show. I'm just show it. Yeah, but it won't be as much fun
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:48.100]   Well, they're only hearing me now so they hear long silences than me so incidentally somebody in the chatroom
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.980]   Thank you Carlos Contreras says the live map is in the left column under apps
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:59.460]   It's the very first app listed so you can that was just another shortcut to go there
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:05.100]   Funny thing is there's a lot of people if you look at the dots. Yeah with zero viewers
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.900]   Well, yeah, they're not as famous as we are Leo no, but
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.140]   Wow, I just I feel like this is really interesting technology. It's fast. Yeah
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.820]   So now I've got around the New York area. There's something called Iraq news and they're live with
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.540]   253 350 reviewers tons of Iraq
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.900]   Magic I mean this is the beginning of
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.620]   a new medium almost a new broadcast medium in a way that even though periscope
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.380]   pioneered it or or meerkat or
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:42.940]   You know Justin TV pioneered it. This is this is so easy and so many people are on Facebook
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.020]   I
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.980]   Can only imagine
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.420]   What the impact I mean would CNN start using this well?
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.220]   Yes, they will in fact a lot of broadcasters if you go to the Facebook live page at the bottom
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.900]   You'll see broadcasters have been using it all day
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.140]   But the best story about this is whole hai Ramos from his young
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.500]   When he covered for example the New Hampshire primary he did
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:10.020]   Three broadcasts that added up to 75 minutes right there were long broadcasts and he got four and a half million viewers that
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.620]   news, of course
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:17.460]   He's been using snapchat and all these media, but I think the advantage of this is now
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.740]   I presume after I'm done this is saved on my Facebook timeline. Yes, it is
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.740]   This is gonna be a lot of really long boring video on the Facebook my case because it's one-sided
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.660]   But you don't hear the people want to hear you and all the hearing is Steve sailor
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.500]   Who's a good friend from the Toronto area says we started using it at the radio stations. He works for
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.940]   makes sense. Yeah
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.700]   Yeah, we'll use this
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.780]   Okay, so we're gonna be at the somebody asked are you gonna be at NAB with this and we were gonna be at the National Association
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.780]   And broadcasters convention next month in the live you booth. What is live you?
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:56.480]   It's a company that sells or leases some very expensive hardware that allows you to live stream from anywhere
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.420]   You think the cell network
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.640]   Wow
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.760]   This is impressive Wow
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.840]   Chris Cox and Steve Fon says it's not reached the live map cannot be reached from France
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.920]   I don't know why that would be but but it's interesting because in general. This is a global rollout, right? I think what do they say?
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.960]   190 countries or something. Well, yeah, because if you look at the map they're using it from everywhere
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   Everywhere man
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.640]   Iraq weed is live now
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.560]   That is amazing and is really
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.200]   fascinating we live in interesting times and then I guess the
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.160]   Oh, I see the reason you saw that is because it had a pulsing blob
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.080]   Yes, and that is that is music from Iraq
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.520]   Yes, they're featuring it. Maybe that's it. I guess so cuz that's sure connections
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.120]   I'm seeing some featured stuff. Here's one from Thailand
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   308 viewers I
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   Hope it doesn't devolve though to attractive young women
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   You know getting all of the
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.360]   Feeds, but people especially males being
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.760]   Okay, well Leo, that's that's the difference right why how are you gonna discover a video in general?
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.400]   You're gonna discover it because it's somebody who's already involved with your feed in some way right?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.640]   It's a news source that you're following. It's another reason to want us to follow a news source
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:32.080]   You're not gonna get it just because unless you go to this map even then it's so random the map
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.320]   I think it's a way to sample. Why don't you hit a few? Let's just watch what's happening. Okay?
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.280]   Here's Anja
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   Jacas Bon Son
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   Front was that she here for V spotan?
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.200]   She's got
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.240]   She's in the car. It looks like. No, she's just sitting in our living room
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.220]   Speaking German or I presume so let's she's smoking. Yeah, you should quit smoking
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:06.120]   Yeah, I'm saying there Leo Rauken Istva Bolton
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.040]   Falcon Istva Bolton
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   Okay, how do I do that type that?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.920]   Yeah, somewhere she sneezed I don't see how I comment where do I come?
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.920]   I
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.760]   Can like it maybe it's over
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:37.440]   I've been told by people like Chad Johnson people who work on twitch a lot that
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.320]   The key to success in at least twitch videos is to interact with the chatroom
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.400]   Yes, I think I've learned that
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.800]   for another venues
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.160]   Oh, this is amazing. Yeah, not a lot from Africa, but I don't know what this map
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   I don't understand obviously this isn't all of them because there's must be many many more going on right now
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   Well, this is brand new. I'm not so sure it's no. I don't think we're discovered it yet
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.400]   Yeah, but I says we've been all in the US has gotten denser
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:12.120]   These ghosts you know what I find fascinating is Facebook's move into publishing basically and another story that broke today
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.840]   Medium has announced that if you want as a publication
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.200]   To start using medium as your content management system. They'll support you with ad monetization
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.560]   publishing to
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   amp amp or
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.160]   Facebook articles instant articles and the membership structure as well
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.960]   So you can have members
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:39.440]   more of a community and I know that they got the all move there a million standard and the all both move there
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.200]   I think about 10 moving there. I'm going to a I guess a press conference thing tomorrow here in New York on it in the afternoon
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.800]   Why oh so first of all of course and we say this all the time
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.360]   I say it to you because you publish a lot on the medium if you don't own your platform then you're
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.680]   You know at have Williams mercy
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:02.080]   Well, but you know what Leo they're so fun. You can have the exact same conversation with the Washington Post and Facebook
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.120]   That's true, right because where are they getting their audience? They're getting their audience on Facebook
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.640]   So I'm where am I getting my audience? I'm getting on medium. If I put some of my blog now what happens three readers and a bunch of nasty comments
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.680]   So the destination when you rather have more comments. Yeah and better ones
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.840]   Yeah, you know I put something up this week about about artificial intelligence and journalism
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.720]   So I put it up on medium and I put it up on LinkedIn
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.800]   which I don't do enough and I got you know different comments there and
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:34.000]   Yeah, that's that's that's that is life in publishing now. You're no longer a destination
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.120]   People are trying somebody in the chat rooms trying
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.840]   Victor nota is trying to see if he can get your screen up on one device and my screen on another
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.880]   There is a problem because it's I don't think the audio is completely synced
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.760]   So it will be a little bit disjointed because there's we're not in an exact well
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.320]   You can you can get your Android screen and put me up on the screen next to your to your screen. Mm-hmm, right?
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.480]   You got the studio. Yeah. Yeah, but
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.960]   We I want to be have another way of doing that. It's called a 30 death thousand dollar tricaster switcher
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:15.040]   Dan Fouts said that his phone alerted me that I had gone live he had liked my page
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.360]   So and he says his phone alerted him that I had gone live, which is of course
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.760]   That is huge isn't it because everybody wants to be a notification
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.960]   Well, remember this what a mess that was on Instagram a couple of weeks ago where that when they added the you know
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.920]   Notify me that somebody's posted on Instagram and all you saw for a whole day or two was people saying add me up
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.720]   Here put add my notification now and Facebook just does it
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.080]   With live video so medium
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.160]   Tell me about this medium platform
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:56.560]   By the way John Louis Gasey's Monday note has moved there. Why would you I guess why would you bother with using a WordPress?
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.880]   Or blocks, but blog when you just put your stuff on medium. There we are that well here
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.680]   Here's the larger way to look at it, right? Yeah, if you're a content maker, well that does that looks pretty damn cool
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.600]   It's better than the sink is bad. It's better than Skype, but that's it's not it doesn't have to be as good as Skype
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.240]   Wow, yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be as real-time as Skype pretty filter on now. I got bass lead on this lens
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.560]   Doesn't work
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.680]   But they could do hangouts styles, you know what if they did hangout style streaming that would be another nail in the coffin
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   I mean, that's one thing hangouts could do you and I could be in a Google hangout together and broadcast that we used to do that
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.520]   Trey rec lifted a show that way on the network a few years ago
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.480]   But we didn't we didn't stick with it because we didn't feel the quality was as is good
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.720]   But as it is with what we're doing well, this is pretty good
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.200]   But it's still not I make you know, you don't do can't do lower thirds and all that oh
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.560]   Diane says it came up on her Facebook news feed what that makes sense
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.840]   Sagan
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.400]   Sorry, Jeff. No, I didn't okay. I thought you said say again to somebody I said say again to you
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.760]   It's just you and me today, baby
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:16.840]   So so so medium so basically we thought our business in the past and publishing was that we had content
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.200]   We had distribution right we had deduction right we had
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.600]   Marketing drugs and sales yeah, right it all those things yeah
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.880]   Basically what it gets down to right now is that we're not the best at distribution
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.520]   We're not the best at marketing. We don't find audience for it
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.880]   We're not the best at ad sales because we don't have as critical mass and data that we need and so do you get to the point
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.080]   Where you just hand over your business to these platforms? I?
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.680]   Went to a I spoke to the board of the
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.440]   Board this week and and there was was
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.200]   Jake from Mike and
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.520]   We're the founders of Mike and he told me something fascinating that when he went to cover the refugees in Europe
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.920]   He made himself a calendar and the first day he said I'm into all periscope. I'm making up the specifics next day
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.600]   I'm gonna do all snapchat now conversations
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:13.920]   I'm gonna do all Instagram and capture it photographically and and which gave me a fright because I said are we training our students to do that
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.400]   Right, but it also says that that what he's done is is that he's reporting
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.960]   appropriately to the medium to the audiences on those media
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:30.400]   The same, you know big story, but he's reaching them. However, he can best reach them and doing it multiple platforms
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.800]   That's where we had
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   It is a little bit of a compromise though, so it reminds me of the difference between
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.880]   In a stereo system having components that you carefully hand select to integrate together or buying on all in one unit
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:56.000]   Or on a computer having like an iMac everything built into one unit as opposed to different components your sack
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.400]   It's not the may not be best in class
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.340]   It's probably best in classic community building certainly better than what you're doing because you're reaching out to others
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.920]   Yes, maybe ad sales you're sacrificing a
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.640]   little bit of control
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.720]   customization and probably profit
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.680]   Well, but hold on
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.760]   So in the in the incident articles deal, right the publisher of publisher sells publishers own ads
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.400]   All the way in my Republic. It has a great look at Italian guy. He's just so perfectly Italian
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.080]   Now you're distracted because you're watching Facebook live now. I understand I am I was looking around here
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:33.320]   Great this guy is just this what he bet he has a lot of pasta. We had in in studio yesterday
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   We had 20 people from Italy
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.800]   From the Italian Chamber of Commerce
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.760]   They were going around to businesses
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:48.120]   And they came to ours to watch tech news today and to a person they were gorgeous all the guys all the women they were put together
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.640]   They were well-dressed they were gorgeous and
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:58.000]   I was not gorgeous, but he's but he's got a look. He's got a look. It's a look. It's a look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I was distracted, were we oh
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.920]   So so face is an articles. Yes, so if the publisher sells publishers ads the publisher keeps 100% of the ads if Facebook sells the ad
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.200]   You get 70% which do you think is a better deal?
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.920]   Say that again
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.960]   I have to do the math in my head if the publisher sells the ad keeps 100% of the revenue
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.680]   Yeah, Facebook sells the ad the publisher gets 70% of the revenue
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.160]   Well, wouldn't it be about 100% it'd be a better deal. Oh because the Facebook has
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.360]   Sells better data about the users far more scale can sell at a higher value and more targeted
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.480]   Oh, we don't know this yet. I haven't any publishers who've given me data yet
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.480]   But I can well see that the 70% could beat the hundred percent
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:45.080]   Here's a radio show Woody Woods. Thank you guys smiley. We're watching him at 98 7 the beat
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:52.600]   By the way, I think the problem here is I can't comment on my on my laptop
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.880]   I'll bet you could comment on mobile. I can comment here. No says write a comment. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, there it is
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.120]   There's a go back. So I don't know it's it's maybe a little flaky because I couldn't comment on the other one
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.800]   And look it puts puts more videos by him down here man if I're in radio and I could dance like Woody
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:16.240]   All right, you know what I'm gonna you know what I have to stream my radio show now, don't I?
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.800]   Boyman, I already do
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.360]   Well here's the question here is a serious question, right? Yeah
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.160]   You have sponsors you have everything else
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.360]   Why would you not while we're making the show and forget doing it on the on the phone?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.360]   On the iPad, why would you not feed this direct feed? Oh, can I do that? Yes, you can't treat again
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   Your ads, right? Let's get on that right now. Let's figure out how I could I how could I feed our feed into this?
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.800]   I think we just pointed a TV set
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:25:00.440]   But what would the what's the value add there value was an extra audience because they they stumble on it on Facebook
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.240]   Yeah, now it's it's a it's live and then it's archived but your ads are still in there
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.920]   Right, I see Alex couple running over to John they're conferring
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:19.160]   By the end of the show I bet you're gonna be the feed of the show will be on Facebook. This is and this is
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.600]   They love a challenge. Oh, they're all exciting watch sucks video
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.800]   Right, maybe want to show again because we did that before we were on there. Uh, that ain't from a phone
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.320]   He's waiting for you. He's handed something. What does this dude is this?
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.560]   It's a video cap. But what remember what I want is this this stream you went to the
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.240]   Any video capture
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.200]   Oh, okay, I
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.240]   Don't know Facebook smart enough to take video from anywhere but the built-in camera
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.320]   That's the problem, right? I think you have to aim the camera at a TV if you're gonna do that
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:03.920]   But see it's all gonna come down to this by the way kids little tip. Don't eat these little silicon packets, okay?
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.320]   So this is gonna do it, huh?
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.800]   This is the key oh wow, that's a weird shot
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:24.560]   All right, but go go back to the map you know, okay back to the map we go back to the map and
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   And
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.280]   Then go the bottom of the page
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:36.360]   I've completely lost every every control of everything here
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.840]   We
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   The world is changing too fast. That's time for me to retire go to the bottom of the page
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:51.360]   I can't go down earlier today. No, it's not scroll scrolling now earlier today if you scroll down like our people broadcasting from Antarctica
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.520]   They know I had it had promotions for
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:01.120]   Others who were on earlier. Oh, so they had a lot of TV station people on
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:10.400]   Well, cuz TV people but see the real value of this is is not for me or even radio stations both of them have
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.440]   Have our own distribution medium. It's for people who don't who merely have a phone. Why would you not also exploit it?
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.560]   Now we're cooking with gas
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   If I can figure out how to get this into here. I
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.320]   Don't think yes, so this is USB. Oh, I can't get that into an iPad
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.320]   Okay back to the drawing board
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:41.960]   HtMI to USB TV
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.080]   But I don't think yeah, but see
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:51.720]   I don't think that the I don't think the Facebook on the iPhone will take its video from the USB port
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   I think it's wants it from the camera, right?
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.480]   But you know what mark Zuckerberg mark sucker by of you watching mark mark
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.960]   There's an idea for professional broadcasters, but this isn't about professionals is it?
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.480]   That's what I was about to say well, you can't see you probably doesn't want to ruin it with you know boring professional broadcasts
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.560]   Right you want real people who for the first time have a broadcast studio that can reach
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   one and a half billion people
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:24.360]   Amen, but you know what if I'm sitting in my office and I can suddenly watch a
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.720]   Show I want to watch on Facebook. Why wouldn't Facebook enable that? I want to watch
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.160]   You know morning Joe
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.640]   Can I do this with a PC somebody saying you can do it with a PC. Can I do it with a PC?
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.880]   No, I don't think so. I can't go like it only were only broadcast only mobile. Right? Yeah
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:50.400]   Right doesn't I'm wrong. Yeah. Yeah, so but what is but again? I want to underscore the importance of this
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.960]   When we were on tech TV
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.200]   We spent in six years
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:04.760]   More than six hundred million dollars more than half a billion dollars and in order to get our signal into 41 million homes
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.680]   Half a billion dollars in 1998 tonight
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:16.700]   2004 to get into a hat and to get it into 41 million homes and by the way as a result Comcast paid
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.320]   300 million dollars for tech TV to get those 44 million homes for themselves, right?
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:29.440]   I can now with a phone and an internet connection. I'm in one and a half billion homes for free
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.440]   Right, or hey Ramos
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.800]   4.5 million so I just went wandering around the map because I'm not paying attention to you
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.400]   I'm paying attention to the world now and there's something like Arizona
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:47.120]   That's my deepest fear by the way, I know T-Mobile arena is live now somewhere, right? And it's looks like a camera feed
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.640]   Where is it I lost it?
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.680]   Oh, I'm sure we'll figure out a way, but I think that that's not the point of this at all is
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.480]   - you don't want polished
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.120]   You want real people?
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.740]   Talking about stuff. It's a it's like podcasting right? Oh, I just see Mike
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.420]   I'll get a new from Cuba. Oh, of course if he does you're a mad now because we try to get a money show
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.640]   You notice no signals coming out of Cuba right now. No
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.880]   Boy this another way that people who don't have broadband access are disadvantaged, right?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.000]   Now you're not merely being
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.600]   Disenfranchised as somebody who can get information you're being distant you're losing your voice. You don't have a voice
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.940]   All right, who's gonna be the first person to pull a Justin Kahn and just leave it on all the time?
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:45.420]   All that will happen. I wonder whether there's some limit to what Facebook wants you to do. I'm just gonna leave this on forever
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.720]   I have 938 viewers. That's enough for me
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.700]   to just
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:58.140]   Keep doing things dot-com is live now. They're making bubble tea and milk and Astoria
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.700]   Now now people like Andrew keen would say yeah, okay
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:10.820]   This is great. We have now used these cream of modern technology to put
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:17.940]   Absolutely stupid trivial content to see the real people because who cares about that that that's not Andrew key
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:26.880]   A favorite's not I I'm by Tom Anderson saying how can I share your broadcast? I think you can share it
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:32.400]   Yeah, you share it. There's a share button just like there would you in Facebook. Yeah, yeah, yeah, please do in fact
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   Yeah
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:44.720]   This is so media okay, so again back to the medium thing so right if you so now if I wanted to do a mess
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.080]   This is the same thing isn't it if I want to do a magazine right?
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:55.040]   I don't need printing presses trucks. Nope marketing teams ad sales departments. I just need content
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.680]   I know you department. I don't yeah, I don't even see MS
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.880]   Because the content management system is provided and it by the way is an excellent right you use it. I love writing on medium
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:11.120]   Beautiful. So was this Ev Williams plan all along you think no, I don't think I think as with Twitter would say
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   I don't know what this is. I know it's something
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.540]   And and don't forget he just got rid of his own publications
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.080]   I think that's part and part so he's not gonna compete with these people now. Yeah, he's gonna sell them and
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.280]   Becomes a great platform for publishers and you still own your own copyright
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.440]   So you want to post it on Huffington Post - or you want to post on your blog - that's fine as far as I know
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.520]   But why would you bother?
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.280]   And it looks good if you go to Pacific Standard magazine there aren't there entirely on medium if you if you well
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.120]   But even better you put you publish it on medium and then you know remember
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:48.520]   We made a big deal about this whole post once syndicate everywhere posse concept Kevin Marx was talking about it with the new web camp
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:54.600]   And how I you know I have my known site and I can but that's what this does you push a button and you're getting amped content
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:59.840]   And you're getting instant articles so you did Tonya try to get Kevin today. This would be perfect topic for him. We did
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:05.000]   Yeah, I think we we we try everybody we just came up dry
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.440]   Interesting very interesting
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:16.200]   By the way, not the biggest story. We're gonna take a break and come back. We will talk about a story that's making me see red and
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.320]   to me
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:25.920]   Bodes poorly for the future of Google. Yep, and I feel like this is not this Google's gonna cave on this
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.360]   But we'll talk about well, they already have they've started caving Leo
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.360]   Yeah, they've started but not sufficiently
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.220]   Revolve the subject when we come back or as somebody put it
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.480]   Google just sold me a can of hummus and there's not even any hummus in it
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.600]   That was on medium by the way, I
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.180]   Do find I'm reading more and more meat articles on medium that just see them more
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.740]   Yep become a real platform
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:57.320]   Should I be writing should I I have blogs on Squarespace? I have blogs that with known
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.360]   Should I just shut my blogs down and just put everything on medium?
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.780]   No, I think what you see is the beginning of medium will put it on amp and put it on instant articles
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:13.340]   One of these is gonna be your I mean and so what Kevin Marks's vision is right is that you you write once published many and
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.500]   Which I I agree with in general
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:23.380]   But the problem with that is that you then do what's inappropriate right if you can publish for medium to snapchat that would be really stupid
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.300]   Because it would be the wrong thing for snapchat right
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:32.920]   In even the idea of instant articles, I think that's so egocentric of us in media think oh the world wants my article
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.260]   They want my 600 words my 800 words. Well, no no do what's appropriate to Facebook
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:43.480]   That's why Facebook live is so fascinating to me because it does enable a conversation. Hi people and
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.540]   Notice I'm not like it you Daniel Horton says don't write for medium
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:53.060]   You'd be writing for someone else's platform and benefit not yours, but that's not quite exactly what world is now
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.980]   That's that's just that's just that's just it. We and it's not about the platforms
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.580]   We tend to look at this. I had this argument with Emily Bell
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:06.700]   You know in distance and that's the first show the first pilot. We're gonna do the New York, which show is me debating Emily Bell about this and
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.940]   Because we don't have this everything ready to do it right
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.620]   so we're just gonna do a debate as a as an experiment and
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.220]   the
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.700]   issue is
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.300]   That we in media as institution tend to look at Facebook as a competing institution
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:28.060]   What you should see when you look at Facebook is a billion people yeah, you don't see Mark Zuckerberg
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:35.060]   You see a billion people and and the problem is we can't see the trees for the forest. Mm-hmm, right?
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.420]   So
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.860]   No, it's not that you owe your doing Facebook something
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.540]   No, you're going to serve the public who you want and that's where they are. That's where they choose to be
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.540]   What are you gonna do say no, no, no, you have to come to me
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.940]   I'm not gonna work anymore. Yeah, sorry
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:57.180]   How we make money on this how we how do we you know my argument is and oh, I don't know what you don't want to see
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.100]   Yeah, he's carrying gifts Jeff Jarvis
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.580]   Isn't it we have to have relationships with people and it's gonna be hard to maintain those relationships across multiple platforms
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.820]   And how we do that is gonna be a major skill I?
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:14.820]   Also worry about and I think this is one of the concerns I'm seeing in the Facebook comments
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.940]   I now have two comment sections two chat rooms
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.780]   is that it's a it's a it's a
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:26.460]   Conensation of the total platforms, right?
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.740]   We're just gonna get what if we just got medium and Facebook and a handful of other options
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.620]   We're getting we're getting competitors. Well, right?
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.260]   So that's the other I'm only makes is that is it all right now all the media is down in two hands
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.260]   Well, that's not good
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:44.740]   That's killed radio is the four companies on all the radio station
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:50.660]   Julia what's your name care? It's the issues the wife of Piketty
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.860]   Piketty Piketty Thomas Piketty who wrote that book about
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.300]   So it turns out that
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:08.060]   In the United States 0.12% of the active population are journalists are active journalists
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.900]   There's no pain attention 0.12. I'm just trying to get you in the chat 0.12
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.900]   That's not a lot of active journalists, but that's gonna change isn't it?
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:24.940]   Then my point is that was what we held control of in the world right right right and now what Facebook and Google and medium have opened it up to many
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.940]   Many many more people so more voices
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:33.660]   Sentine the lack of our control or losing control of media to the people will I celebrate that well
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.580]   That's you that's the YouTube thing and I guess there'll be enough platforms that it's not going to be
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.620]   It's not like you're gonna have William Randolph Hearst controlling the press
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.900]   Actually, here's this here's the substantial difference
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.860]   Hearst
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.140]   Decided who got to speak
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   He didn't merely own the platform. He also completely controlled. Yes who got to speak now. I'm hearing I'm hearing audio from something else
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.620]   I'm hearing my audio
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.820]   Okay
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.180]   I'm hearing me
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.500]   So this the difference is yes, you might have a few
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:18.580]   oligarchs controlling these platforms like Mark Zuckerberg's but what they have done is they've made democratic platforms
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.220]   Yes, they have so everybody gets to have a voice
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:27.660]   There are issues that that have to be discussed that and I've said this you know to Facebook's face
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.300]   And I've said it to Google and we've got to have discussions about this because there are higher level issues
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.220]   Journalism has a role in society to inform a society
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:42.580]   Journalism should ask the questions that aren't being asked. They should say unpopular things. They should be able to protect the sources
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.820]   You know and Emily's
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.420]   Speech which is a brilliant speech and Emily's brilliant and it's amazing
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.860]   but but she
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.020]   as
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.740]   Many do complain about the well the Facebook you've complained about this often the algorithm is not transparent
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:05.020]   Which I respond well if it were transparent then now Megan is streaming us streaming that streaming you oh
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:10.540]   Man, it's amazing. You should put it on periscope that way we'd reach more. Let's look at the
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.620]   The latency of that clap
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:19.220]   We're still waiting go ahead. I'm sorry
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.300]   Okay
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:27.740]   Right where was I it's distracting
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:34.140]   It's directed well, right right right so so there are journalistic issues to be dealt with and
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:40.580]   And you know Facebook knows that but Facebook is not you know where the power is is not in constraining who has a voice
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:46.580]   But in promotion so Apple for instance has huge Apple doesn't control podcasting by any means
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:53.420]   However, they have huge weight by who they feature in the podcast listings that
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:40:00.860]   Is the single most important signal for success every podcast or I know is afraid to death of ever offending
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.140]   Rightful after you've placed that one person and it's not algorithm. It's a person. It's a person
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.740]   So that's not good and so that's how these platforms could be nefarious
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:15.540]   It's not that they control who has a voice they let everybody speak but they do can and of course they want to because that their
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.940]   Users are saying give us some curation. There's a million voices. Who should I be listening to?
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.460]   Right, there's also an argument that
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.180]   Then the the algorithm what it is an algorithm at Facebook should be made transparent
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:33.420]   Well, the obvious first problem with that is that it'll be game and it'll be gained by the way by my colleagues in news media
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:38.300]   We'll we'll do everything we can in our old business model to get more page views and we will mess it up
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:44.740]   So what I argue is perhaps what the platform should do press what Facebook should do is to say to Marty Barron the
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.980]   Legendary now editor of the Boston of the Washington Post Marty. We trust you. You're you're important
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.700]   We will we will give you an allocation of attention
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.380]   You got it you got to do something important and and and the audience has to agree with you in the end
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.620]   but if
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.860]   if you do
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:09.660]   Then fine you can tell the world what's important and we'll let you do that. Well, it's not even we will give you it
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:17.020]   Just as there are more voices there are more curation voices and so more people will emerge who will be curators
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:22.340]   And if you if you like Marty or Breitbart, whoever it is that you like you will follow their curation
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.940]   And that will be but that what I fear is that I so the iTunes example is really
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:33.100]   pernicious because they they really control success and podcasting
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.860]   Through their iTunes recommendations now the only solution to that has been to
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.980]   diversify the platform and the good news at least for us is
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:47.260]   What our iTunes listenership went from 90% of all of our listenership to less than 50
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:53.460]   Over time as they're more podcast apps. One of the reasons we want apps right is because we want to do our own
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.860]   curation and promotion. We don't want people to have find us merely through iTunes
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:05.260]   But it's happens on YouTube. It happens on Facebook those platforms have huge
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.940]   There's a proper there's a proper discussion to be hell about the ethics of this
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:15.140]   And and I don't know where that goes because Facebook will remind you to their primary job is not to inform society
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.420]   Their primary job is to connect people their secondary job is to entertain this and then by the way
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:25.180]   They also do happen to inform society, but that's that's a come along. That's not that's not a primary goal
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:31.100]   That they have as a business and so we have to keep that in mind. They want to have people have a good time on Facebook
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.940]   That's their job. That's their that's that's what they do is a mission
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.260]   They now have a role in informed society
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:41.660]   They have a role in giving people who don't have voices right what that here's I said that about Google too
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.380]   But and then you've given me the counter argument. Yeah, but they're a business
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:51.820]   So they shouldn't have to worry about their responsibilities. No, no, they they end up with responsibilities. No, I'm disagreeing myself
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:57.260]   I guess I don't know if I said that no they do have responsibilities, but they don't they kind of didn't ask for them
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.660]   They're not replacing us in our function, right?
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.500]   So there has to be some discussion. Well, here's the example where it comes is anonymity
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.620]   when
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:15.660]   Facebook has outlawed anonymity and people who are using Facebook who are oppressed who are trying to use this platform to connect and to be heard
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:21.940]   Which is what Facebook wants then how does Facebook deal with the ethics of protecting a vulnerable person?
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.900]   That's a question that they have to ask with their role. It's not a question, you know
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:31.340]   Media we'd say we'll say an unnamed source. We keep his name wide because we're just gonna hurt him
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   right I
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.700]   Hate to rely upon the kindness of strangers you always have
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.620]   How much choice
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.820]   and and ultimately
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.100]   All of that aside is still is with democratizing
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:54.900]   I mean it still gives somebody in Iraq a chance to make a live stream and for others to tweet it
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.700]   Which is a completely independent platform and point people to it on Facebook and and on and on and on
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:04.260]   And so it's it's completely possible for somebody to find an audience
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.940]   This map outside map is just it's just mind-boggling
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:15.460]   I know right now that there are so many dots around New York City. I can't zoom in any farther. Yeah, they all mushed together
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.460]   Yeah, evil Maya Maya is live now all I
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:24.460]   So Daniel Horton saying I wish Facebook would make mentions live for everyone and not just the site
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:28.780]   So the elite chosen few that's just what happened Daniel. That's what you're seeing
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:34.700]   You can do exactly what we're doing right now and if the there is still some elitism because
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:42.740]   Because well because of us and because I you know, I've had I've been doing this for a long time or whatever reason
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:49.860]   We still have more clout and more ability to promote but Daniel if you did some amazing stream that everybody said this guy is incredible
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.300]   He's playing the ukulele like on fire. He's like the air clap to the ukulele
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:59.460]   I bet you would get an audience and that's what's really interesting. You'd have your content has to be good
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.740]   Very very interesting. I know you know, this is so new
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.500]   It's hard to imagine what it really means, but it's pretty clear just from us doing this now
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.740]   There are more people I should point out watching this on Facebook live than are watching it on our live stream
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.900]   Eggo
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.940]   Eggo
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.940]   That's that's this
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.180]   That's important
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:25.540]   Yeah, because it's a the promotional vehicle the promotional platform of Facebook
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.500]   You know, it's you have to know about us to find our live stream. You have to know where to go
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:36.740]   Nobody's googling. Where could I watch a conversation of Facebook live? Leo generally what proportion of the audience watches live
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:43.920]   Five percent ten percent depends on the show. So that's that's uh, you know as you point out is that we're gonna
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.180]   Have a different context, but you know that that changes the the feeling of the show
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:54.740]   Yeah, but but is maybe Facebook live should be the live platform for the show if you can figure out how to get it
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:46:00.580]   Well, it's actually roughly equal what we were just showing the you stream feed there are you know four or five feet
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:06.760]   So it probably is still more on our time give it time. I mean, you'll find new audience people
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   Have you heard this lee on the port is on now?
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:13.820]   Yeah, but I think I should do more cleavage if that's gonna be the case
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.820]   Okay, here we go. Here we go
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:23.700]   You're not gonna show that we go yeah nice Jeff nice. That's I don't know if that really is gonna
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:31.100]   You're ready to go with the ceiling man there go it up, but you know to be fair
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:39.580]   Success in television is it's a visual medium has always had a lot to do with attractiveness as opposed to content. Well, I break that rule I
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.540]   Said success Jeff
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.500]   Hey, you you were on moonlighting me nothing
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.540]   So I was on as as somebody who wanted to burst my bubble once said to me
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:57.100]   You're a minor celebrity on an unknown tech channel
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:04.020]   And I said yeah, you're absolutely right. I know I prefer Demi celebrity Demi celebrity
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:10.720]   You're a second a second rate. I think she said you're a third rate celebrity on a minor tech
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:18.360]   In order to go shady with no it was it was a woman she deflated me entirely I
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.780]   Won't talk to you
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:26.140]   We're gonna take a break come back and talk about revolve first though and let Jeff watch the map go ahead play with the map
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.700]   Jeff I'm gonna go run down the hall for once. Okay, that's also that's also okay
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.720]   That's why we need three people on the show because when am I supposed to run down the hall our show
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:43.500]   It's brought to you by fresh books the super simple cloud accounting software that it changed my life way back when I was a freelancer
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.780]   Going to Canada every month for a week doing a TV show there. I had a billum for
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:55.740]   Travel for food for my time. I had a billum in Canadian dollars. It was such a pain
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.900]   It literally won one six month period. I did not invoice them at all now
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.060]   Sure that saved me a lot of time invoicing it
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.700]   In the end it wasn't a good idea because of course when you don't invoice you don't get paid
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:15.420]   And when I finally did get together and say well I better send them these invoices the accounting department call me
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.860]   I was like what are you doing if you ever do this again? We're not paying it you need to bill us monthly
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:25.200]   That's when amber MacArthur told me about fresh books a local company in Toronto just starting up in
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.460]   2003 and
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.860]   Man they changed my life. It made it so easy to do the invoices
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.540]   Just an email them out and by the way right there on
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:42.820]   The invoice is a button for your client to pay it and I got to tell you people hate paying bills as much as you hate
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:47.540]   Sending bills. It's not about the money. It's just a pay. It's a chore. It's something you don't want to do
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:54.380]   So if you make it easy for them, you're gonna get paid faster fresh books says on average five days faster when you use fresh books
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.780]   They've also got features that will you know make it easier come tax time
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:05.620]   Those reports that they generate will make your accountant or you if you're doing your own taxes a lot happier
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:11.620]   Because you could take pictures of the receipts no more cardboard shoebox, you know and organize them for later
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:19.340]   You can actually using the automatic get your your mileage into fresh books automatically I
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:25.620]   Mean for a lot of people the best part about fresh books is that feeling of zen? Oh the calm
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.700]   You have when tax time comes around oh I can breathe if

[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.620]   Okay, yeah, I gotta figure out
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.460]   I
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.940]   Should do a different thing like I could do a cooking show or something like something that I don't do here I

[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:14.220]   All right, this revolve thing for Sam's on and then the waterproof. Yeah, the waterproof phone
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:20.520]   I can't do this on Android right now. I have to use an iOS device with mentions mentions you can't oh with
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.780]   Bensions, okay, I have mentions on here. You know, I have to say I think
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:30.740]   More and more this new iPad Pro the little one which I bought is the ultimate media tool
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:37.180]   I can make podcasts I could do blog posts now. I can do a TV show this thing this little thing which fits in my backpack
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:43.060]   And and it has all the everything you need I even put ethernet on if I this has everything
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.620]   This is like a media creation tool. Yeah, I'm which which
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:53.700]   And by the way, I guess I'll eat crow here because remember when I re-boxed yeah, I pad read clean
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.900]   It's because I said it was not a creation tool
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.380]   Well, it wasn't wasn't then but it is now it has become one oh
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:06.900]   My battery also went fluid. Oh, yeah, apparently it's a big battery. Oh, yeah
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.340]   So if I have Robert scoble come out we'll get in the hot tub together and we'll do
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.860]   Forbittin visual
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:19.820]   And now a couple of middle aged fat guys
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:31.380]   Revolve this is pissing me off and I really think Google has blown this big time first of all
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:34.780]   I know they're having trouble with nest nest is not living up to its expectation
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:39.340]   They spent several billion dollars. They only had half a billion in revenue last year
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:46.820]   Executives are leaving like rats leaving a sinking ship. They're even fighting there's in fighting remember nest bought drop cam
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:52.740]   And then the drop cam founder started saying to Tony Fidelity should stop blaming us for your bad results
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:58.060]   We were doing great till you bought us as a biggest mistake. I ever made oh what a mess
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.740]   This is what this is this is what alphabet have wrought
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:07.740]   Because once you spread these you know get these guys financials out of the Google financials and it's in public
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.540]   Suddenly if they're eating their young
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.700]   Right, yeah
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.340]   So the latest thing is
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:23.560]   Nest bought a little company called revolve. They made a smart home hub. It was
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.780]   It did look a little bit like a jar of hummus
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.420]   And it you know, it's not just that the hub caused a couple hundred bucks and
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.380]   That on the box they promised lifetime
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:44.340]   Support but then people probably went out and bought other things to work with it, right?
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.940]   Some people that spent thousands on lights and locks and all this stuff
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:54.100]   There was a great medium post. This is where the hummus came from
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:55:00.820]   by a guy who had used this to completely automate his house and
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:05.580]   That time
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.260]   Tony Fidelity writes this is Arlo Gilbert sold me a container of hummus
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:17.180]   This hummus cost two dollars and nine and nine cents Tony Fidelity sold me a $299 empty container of hummus
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   He didn't even get the hummus, but he but this is you know
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.700]   This is he'd really set up everything to work with this thing
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:25.400]   I
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:32.700]   Nast has announced that they're gonna shut it down. I'm not just shut down the company not just shut down the product, but
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:39.440]   The service they're gonna brick well not even the server. They're gonna brick his device the revolve apple
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.660]   No, no after May 15th will no longer open the hub won't work
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.420]   Is my product still under warranty? It says on the FAQ on the revolve site. No
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:54.340]   Our one-year warranty against defects and materials or workmanship has expired for all revolved products now
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:56:01.280]   I understand you can you can stop making a product I understand but this really highlights first of all the vulnerability of
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.620]   Internet of things machines for instance Google's on hub router
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:09.820]   You know Asus doesn't need to provide any services
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:14.100]   To my Asus router, but the on hub needs services
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.020]   the revolve needs services and
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:23.820]   Audit and there's a contract. There's an implied contract that when you buy it you can keep using it and for them to cut it off
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:28.100]   And you know you want the definition of what's evil? This is evil. I
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:36.620]   Think so Arlo says hey if I bought a Dell computer and then Dell said oh your computer will not work after the warranty period
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:44.140]   And there's there's there's the warranty, but then there's also this kind of as you say implied contract now
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:49.060]   There's there's a caveat emptor to the extent that oh we're gonna stop supporting this
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:54.020]   We're gonna stop making new things for it. You're stuck with it as is but you know hey you can go ahead and use it
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.780]   Okay, right
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:01.020]   But you paid for it unlike let's say a subscription service where we stop making it on him a weekly
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:02.180]   You just stop getting it
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:07.380]   But a magazine company has to give you a refund or another magazine on your choice
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:13.740]   This case you bought a product with a presumption that would work as long as you could keep it going and to them brick it
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.140]   And turn it off. That's just wrong now
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:20.660]   However, Google has come in and if you go to the I think it's two links down on the rundown layer
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.420]   I put it in the latest now they've kind of sort of
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.860]   This is not this is not what they need to do
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:32.900]   Maya culpa on top of the mountain. They just keep the freaking servers running. I'm sorry
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:38.180]   It's not that expensive or or refund everybody there's some well that's expensive that's 300 bucks
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:42.740]   But it would not cost 300 bucks a user to keep some server on some Google guys
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.220]   desk running so that this would work and
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:50.460]   Here's the real problem for Google besides the PR stain
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:58.220]   Google's already got a wrap of discontinuing stuff people love Google readers Google wave and Google buzz and Google
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:06.980]   I mean on and on and on and why I'm not gonna buy another Google product if if Google could just lose interest one day and turn it off
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:11.180]   This is this is a business killer. This is horrific
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:16.900]   I'm driving down the road in my Google car or it's driving me and suddenly it just stops and says sorry
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.900]   You're not supported anymore
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:26.780]   And and to refer as revolve has in its page, which is just jaunty and disgusting. Yes
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:29.380]   - well, you know, yeah
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:34.820]   Nothing lasts forever. We're shutting it down. It was great. We thank you for your support
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.500]   Thanks, Tim and Mike screw you
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.580]   I
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:47.320]   Just I oh, you know, we're sad for the end of revolve, but this isn't the end of the connected home
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:53.140]   This is the beginning. Yeah, you know what jobs it might not be because you guys have demonstrated everybody
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:59:00.820]   The real vulnerability of Internet of Things stuff if it needs a server and the company for whatever reason decides after a few years
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:06.300]   Yeah, it didn't work out so good. You got a piece of hardware. It doesn't work. That's not like a computer
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.620]   It's like a my smartphone will continue to work even if Google goes out of business
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.980]   I mean I get updates, but that's not I'm saying to break it
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:24.220]   They're breaking it well plus that it feels like it was the servers that turn off it feels like they reached into your home and
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.220]   Turned something off. Yes
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:30.180]   Oh, we got our money Google bought us see ya. Bye
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.340]   Yeah, I
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:37.300]   Not a googly thing to do this is or maybe an alphabet anything to do. It's not a googly thing
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:40.220]   Well, I'm telling you alphabet has to swallow this I
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:46.700]   Know nest is hemorrhaging money blah blah blah alphabet has to swallow this and just keep the server running
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:52.060]   That's all they have to do if they don't and you know what eventually the last revolve user will die
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:58.700]   Or find something better, but if they don't it says it's not about revolve or revolve users
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.860]   It's about these strong impression. It's given me and many others. I'm sure
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.700]   That Google is not in it for the long haul
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.140]   Yep
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.380]   Google is here. Here's the other point of it is Google is a personal services company
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:19.300]   Full stop Google knows you as an individual that gives you services whether that's Gmail or search or maps
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.220]   It knows you as an individual has an individual relationship with you
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.080]   That is the strength that it has versus mass marketing and mass distribution companies
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:33.460]   Well, that means that you can't f over those individuals Google and that is the basis of don't be evil
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.860]   Right it says if we are evil we will lose business. Well
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.860]   People's faith away now somebody somebody might have said in there some cold-hearted
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.180]   Scrooge might have said ah
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:50.740]   What is it? I'm very coming could they possibly have sold it's tiny that it's not the point impact on your reputation
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.980]   Yeah, that's the it's the reputation damage and
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:01:01.980]   And and not just to Google really but to the Internet of Things ecosystem in general, but here's here's the takeaway
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.260]   We should all keep in mind
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:11.100]   Maybe this is time to remember that you want to use a product that services are open that other companies could support
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.860]   that you could run your own server if you had to or
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:20.380]   You know if revolve or more open somebody could step up and say well, you know
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.620]   it's too small a business for revolve, but I'd be glad to run this server and
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.740]   And you give me a couple of bucks a month
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:31.180]   That there's you know, I have a friend who made a lot of money
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:39.300]   With payphones of all things he said 18t tired of pay phones. They didn't want to run them
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.340]   They didn't want to maintain them it was too small a business for them
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.300]   So he bought the pay phone business from them. It was a billion dollar business for him
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.140]   Because there's still pay phones in a lot of places
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:56.580]   he modernized it he put money into it and he made a ton of money and
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.180]   But 18t's happy
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.300]   Because they got rid of it. That's I mean, maybe that's what Google should do, but
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   And I would submit if you're going to
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.860]   Going forward. I've certainly learned my lesson. Let's not rely on
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.140]   Let's not buy things that rely on companies good will to keep them running
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.620]   You know open
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.020]   Your TV still works if other if NBC goes out of business
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.900]   Pick an open standard
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.100]   Yep
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.780]   The guy who lives in the van in the Google parking lot could do it says River Mike
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:35.220]   Right. Yeah, just have him give him an old PC an old Dell
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:39.520]   Probably what I mean how much money is this costing them?
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.420]   I mean, that's the point
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:46.500]   They sold maybe they sold a thousand of these how hard would it be to keep that server for a thousand people running nothing nothing right?
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:53.500]   There you know what they will back down. I guarantee you. This is too bad. The press is terrible for them and
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.340]   Tim and Mike shame on you
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.380]   Glad you got a good job screw you
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:12.740]   How much does Google really know about you we already know that they set the dashboard that they're talking about we already know that
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:15.700]   Well, that's but yeah, that's the mirror finally figuring it out
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:22.380]   Australians here's something we know Australians Googled for five hundred and twenty two million hours last year
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:27.220]   That's why to keep the revolve servers is de minimis compared to that
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.780]   This is Roy Morgan research a
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.180]   Sample of 50,000 internet users indicated an estimated
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:42.460]   16.9 million Australians older than the age of 15 of 14 visited Google at least once during a four-week time frame
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.660]   1.9 million Bing 1.8 million Yahoo
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.740]   Wow I
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:56.600]   Mean how much time you spent on Google not that much so five hundred fifty it's like that's a lot of seconds a lot of
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   20 second chunks aggregated
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.380]   Is that your number I hope I didn't steal your number. No, okay? No, I put that in the run down. I didn't
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.980]   So my phone died oh
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.620]   Because you were streaming
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:15.220]   Yeah, I had I had it plugged into a not not to a regular plug plug but into a USB on a
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:22.660]   Strip I guess that wasn't enough power. It was cool. It was going faster than the power. This this is a good argument for doing it with an iPad
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:27.220]   Yeah, because or hey the pixel see with mentions
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.100]   Because that's got a big ass batter a big old batter. Sorry
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.260]   Can't bleep the feed
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.540]   Well, you don't need to bleep see but this is good mark Williams says well now I know about your Twitfieve. Thanks Facebook
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.660]   Right, right see it's it's there's some value
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:51.700]   Live this is gonna play into it. This is a good bad. Yeah, it's interesting
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:05:01.440]   Blackberry poor blackberry I really liked the blackberry priv I bought one my son has your weird
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:08.480]   I know I am weird. I I sent it to my son and Barcelona. He lost his iPhone in the first day in Barcelona. So I sent it to him and he said I
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.160]   Think I have an old iPhone for somewhere in my drawer. Could you please? I mean that instead
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:22.720]   You I mean this is nice. It's like very privates nice Android. They only sold 600,000 in the last quarter. That's down from the
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.680]   expectation of Wall Street they'd sell eight hundred fifty thousand even below the
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.560]   It's actually down a hundred thousand from the units. It's sold in the preceding quarter. So it's basically a long slow slide into night
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.620]   Android did not save blackberry. I feel bad about that, but
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:43.800]   That's that's what happens
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.920]   There are now
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.720]   This is interesting and this kind of runs counter to what I've been saying
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.520]   Which is that there are there are a handful of YouTube people making money and the rest of them are just
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.040]   Working on YouTube's farm helping them get rich according to tube filter
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.400]   There are now
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.120]   2000 YouTube channels with a million subscribers or more
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.640]   Wow is that low to you?
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:13.480]   That's high. I thought it was a fat 500 100. I didn't know
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:20.800]   That's that's a that's kind of impressive now are all those people making money as a million subscribers enough for you to make money I
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.520]   mean
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:27.840]   Let's not say you know twenty dollars a month. Let's say can you make five thousand dollars a month?
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.720]   That would be that would that would be enough to make a living can you make five thousand dollars a month with a million subs?
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.720]   I don't know
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.880]   I'd like to know that number
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.280]   Marcus Brown Lee love him
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.200]   Right. Yeah, I love him great. I just saw a picture on us on his Facebook feed with keys and an empty office
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.800]   Is he starting the business? We probably graduated
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:57.880]   Yeah, but my point is that he was he was of the size to make money on YouTube. Yeah, I would I would hope so
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.560]   I should ask Marcus, you know, we tried to hire him a
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.440]   Year ago or so maybe a little more
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.400]   Made him an offer and he said, you know, I just want to finish college finish my my schooling
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.000]   And then and then you know, but I think there'd be no reason why he would need us at all
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   at all at all
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   This is interesting
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.880]   Twitter bought the rights for Thursday night football
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.560]   and
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.760]   They paid less a lot less than some of the other offers
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.680]   This is this is this is this
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:37.800]   This boggles my mind almost as much as Facebook who's gonna watch an entire game on Twitter as a as a distribution platform for long form
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.280]   And Facebook can be I guess Twitter can be
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.040]   They paid ten million dollars to stream ten games
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:47.200]   That was the NFL said not the highest bid
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.000]   This it's thought that others were offering as much as 15 million dollars
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.280]   Why would the NFL do a deal for five million less? Well, cuz the amount of money ten million is is minimal anyway from the NFL's point of view
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.440]   They clearly feel like
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.160]   Putting it on Twitter is more valuable to them than Verizon or Yahoo or Amazon the other bidders
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:13.080]   But you're right what I can see why Twitter would do it, right? It's good. It's gonna drive traffic to Twitter, right?
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.120]   Yeah, I see what they do it. Well, I am I do it. I don't it's so counter to the experience of Twitter
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.000]   Must not count at a moment
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.640]   You think where I have a conversation about the game with other people who are there
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   But you know you really really reinvent the experience. Yeah from the NFL's point of view. This is all
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.480]   Prelude to the contract negotiations coming in 2021
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:42.440]   The big broadcast contracts expire in 2021 and the NFL needs to know
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.560]   where else they could go to make a ton of money and
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.760]   What the digital rights are worth and who the players are who would want them?
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:58.640]   And so this is all research Verizon did does broadcast right if you're a Verizon customer you can watch NFL on your phone
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.160]   Yeah, it's only abusive like you're on the way home or you're in the subway and you don't
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.320]   Once you get home you're gonna watch it on your big screen. I would think
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.880]   Well, I got you know again
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.760]   I think I think the opportunity is to have a conversation about the game
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.400]   But but you can do that on Twitter without having to have it on the same application
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.680]   You can watch it on TV and then have the conversation on Twitter
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:27.000]   Yeah, I get I get the you know the the second third screen angle to this
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.760]   Do they put it on periscope?
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.240]   Maybe I don't want to watch
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.760]   In a full game or portrait mode
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:44.880]   I
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:51.200]   Get it in the sense from Twitter's point of view. It's just it's great PR
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:59.520]   Right it means we're a media company. I don't know why Facebook didn't bid for it. That would make more sense. Yeah
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   We we were talking with Brad Sam's earlier on Windows Weekly. He's in Cincinnati. He just got Amazon same day delivery prime
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.960]   now
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.840]   And he sent a try it out. I ordered a bag of fertilizer
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.640]   And he said I may be interrupted in the middle of this show
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.280]   Same day deliveries. I just got I just got the food service the Amazon food service in my area
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:36.120]   Did you which is pretty amazing? I haven't gotten it. I'm you know actually used it. How is it different from the other food services?
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.920]   as prepared foods, it's
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.280]   A four dollar a month I think subscription
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.040]   Or for all our week I forget
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:53.580]   And that's your whole delivery cost and that's that you have to really you really have to want what you're ordering on Amazon because prime now
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.080]   gives Amazon prime members a free two hour two hour delivery, but eight dollars if you want one hour delivery and
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:09.880]   That's in Manhattan and you have to tip the courier or you're expected to tip the courier. It's a it's in over 20 cities
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.720]   Including Tokyo Milan
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.640]   London
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.360]   It says it's
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.280]   Perishable's - milk and eggs bread
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.040]   What I like about it is the potential of having
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.920]   prepared meals. Yeah, so I just try to open to install
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.640]   mentions on my
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.880]   Other phone, but the one's running running
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:43.920]   Nutella, yeah, and it's oh doesn't work with it. Oh, it ain't working with that. No, yeah a number of things don't work very well with not rule
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.040]   I've noticed usually complain about
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.280]   Libraries Instagram still runs, but it complains about libraries something, you know, that's just that's an easy thing to fix
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.300]   I can't remember if I've mentioned is on here on my S7 or not
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.320]   I I think I took it off because I was worried about battery
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.880]   But I bet you mentioned no, I don't mentions
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   I bet is better than the regular the full Facebook app because it doesn't it doesn't have ads or anything
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:15.160]   Amazon dot is arriving now around
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.320]   the country
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.820]   Number of people have talked about it. I saw who got it Anthony Nielsen got his dot
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.360]   It's like it's like they cut the top off of an echo
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:33.280]   Small speaker on it still but not much and then it but every other respect is just like the Alexa. He says
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.040]   So I'm sorry the echo gosh
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.080]   Just like the echo
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:44.160]   And I love this idea because I can hook it up to some decent speakers for a change because I use the echo
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   But I have to put up with the speakers
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.320]   And by the way, it works with Bluetooth as well
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.840]   So you could put the new
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:58.880]   Dot on your bedside table Bluetooth it to speakers across the room talk to the dot and have it play
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:02.560]   On your stereo. I can't wait to get mine
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.120]   So
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:12.320]   It will it operate on its own without a big pop a echo I think so but it's speakers crappy
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.360]   But if you want to just talk and do functional things. Yeah, I guess if you want to ask it what time it was that'd be fine, right?
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.880]   So have you heard of
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:29.680]   Sam lessons new company I think I have I have and I'm very intrigued. I mentioned this before Finn. I got an invite
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.120]   Did you cuz I'm trying to get one I was a well, maybe you have mine. It was in the list
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.640]   I was in you know, I just I was just in the list it costs 150 dollars a month what?
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.040]   No, forget it. So it's a it's an intelligent assistant
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.880]   What's interesting about it not only is just for your phone it works on the echo?
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:54.920]   So it could so what and then okay platform, right now the echo is not gonna work if Amazon decides to pull a plug on this
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.320]   but at least
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.620]   anybody can write echo skills and
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:06.120]   an echo skill can be apparently pretty sophisticated because this is a lot smarter than the woman on echo the
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.640]   LEX a woman or a Siri it does a lot of things you can say, you know, what do I need to do tomorrow and with the way you
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   Do it on an echo you'll say
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.880]   ask Finn
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.340]   You know to or I think you have to give it a command, but I can't remember what the command is
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.000]   So it's a
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.440]   Fancy so what it made me sit down and fake is I mean offer for I you know for love
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.960]   You know, what do you think you want for a month, right? But do I have that many questions? No and
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.520]   Is it doing anything?
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:44.300]   $150 better than the Google now or Siri or even echo itself. I'm sure it's doing something's better
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:50.600]   I'm sure they thought it through the Sam's a very very smart guy. Oh, I love Sam. Yeah, but but yeah
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.200]   I it made me think oh, okay. What's the value of this now on the other hand?
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:02.760]   You know when I wrote my my books my my editor my agent book got after because I was so disorganized
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.520]   You know, you got a higher than sister. You got a higher than I said, I can afford higher than you didn't give me enough money
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.960]   I don't know for a hundred fifty bucks a month. I had this assistant when I was in UW. I didn't know what to do with her
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.960]   I yeah that lunch
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.640]   I
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.240]   Do need help I do the organization. I do need services. I do need things. I'm the absent my professor
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.240]   I come by that title quite honestly
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.920]   so
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:27.600]   You know, I could imagine a service that would indeed take things over for me
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.960]   but the but the thought of trying to shift to
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.600]   Working in some system is exhausting to think about yeah, but who knows well
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.360]   That's why I think speech in the long run is gonna be what's because if you can get natural language working
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.120]   Yes, so that we don't have to learn interface right now even for the you know
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.520]   I was giving you an example when I saying well there's some syntax you have to use with Finn
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520]   I shouldn't have to remember syntax
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.600]   No, but that's coming I think
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.060]   What's app just turned on strong encryption?
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:08.120]   For one billion users not just text messaging but video and audio. Oh
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.000]   My stream just ended
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.080]   Well, I don't know it went dark
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.400]   Maybe it's just sleeping. Maybe the battery died. No, it was still a 50%
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.360]   What's going on?
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.320]   Oh, it's kind of blurry and weird. I
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:36.160]   Think I think the application broke. It's still something there is it hot. It looks like you can see me still you guys can see me, right?
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.640]   Or no, it doesn't need power John. It's got 50%
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:46.120]   It's just I think the I think it's a bug or after an hour of streaming it says you really
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.160]   Okay, you should really stop now or maybe I
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.440]   ruined my eyes
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.200]   That's weird is it still working
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:04.720]   It looks like it is kind of yeah, it's still working that's strange
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:12.080]   Just doing some blurry effect on the screen. It's not hot. Oh, I didn't pay my Facebook bill
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.400]   Made it when that happens
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:21.680]   All right, I think we're I think we're done
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.520]   Oh, by the way, we should mention Sam lesson
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.000]   We created a really great little tool that I like called dropio DROP.io
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.280]   I oh allowed you share files
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.440]   Facebook bought it put it out of business another one of those
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.720]   But he designed the Facebook timeline worked for Facebook for a while his wife Jessica lesson runs the information
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.800]   He took a little time off and this is obviously his next thing
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.640]   You want to talk about Yahoo at all
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.080]   Is there anything to say
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.200]   Yahoo
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.960]   Wow
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:18:01.360]   16,600 viewers congratulations. This is your most what live so it did it did shut down look at this
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.800]   So you know what it was doing it was saving it out
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.320]   Well, that's over a period time. You're on the live stream right now on the show not that many
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:17.320]   So 16,600 people watched me live the replay of your live videos been posted save the video to camera roll
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:22.120]   I think not upload higher quality video one gigabyte. Yeah
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.320]   So I'm so that's an interesting switch. I'm allowed to
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.640]   So they streamed that obviously to Facebook to do it live
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:37.480]   But now I can upload bet the actual video from the iPad so that when you watch it'll be better quality
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.000]   Nice
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.400]   Yeah, interrupted press the girl in the room impressive Wow 16,600
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.920]   That's awesome that is that really is and how many of those people are new to us?
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.920]   Well, I don't think it would be that high a number if I hadn't done it live on the show right if I go home and do it
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:00.000]   It won't be 16,600 true unless
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.920]   But it's hot tub tech machine
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.480]   It's the pass along. Oh, no Leo hot tub tech machine
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.720]   I'm telling you it's gonna be good
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:20.440]   Can I do hot tub tech machine?
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:28.840]   My wife says no, it's gonna be awesome. It's my new show from the hot tub
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:33.000]   No
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.360]   Fitbit Blaze and I'll tell I were if it plays the alt is a more attractive version of the same hardware
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.560]   first month one million units
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.680]   Wow, oh great success
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.160]   Probably on a part with maybe not quite on a part with the Apple watch but close
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:58.080]   So I'm sorry we started talking about did you read the vanity fair article about
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:05.200]   Marissa mya versus Kim Kardashian's behind I started I mean I just I do feel for Marissa
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.040]   I just don't know what you would do with Yahoo
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:15.160]   Yeah, the steak was taking the job. Well, no cuz I think she knew it was gonna be tough and she thought
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:23.480]   It's a challenge, but why not do something I've got I made all the money I need to make why not do something interesting and
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.840]   There's the risk of fail
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:32.800]   But the problem means what's you know the question has been before her time in the last three CEOs what is Yahoo?
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.680]   Yeah, it remains so I
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:42.480]   You know supposedly they're selling off the parts, but I don't I don't see any movement in that direction you've got the real problems
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   you've got these these
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:53.440]   You know investors these activist investors who are yelling at you and what they have one board seat. It's just a mess
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:02.520]   It's just a mess. Yep. They her her tagline was we may not be the biggest technology company
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:07.640]   But we are the biggest technology company that understands media. She said that of Bloomberg conference last summer
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:13.520]   Is that true? Did they understand media? They understand the old business immediate which is selling volume advertising, right?
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:20.240]   But to create your new business media they clearly didn't right buzzfeed buzzfeed understands a new vision of media
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.600]   What do you like it or not and the the explanation of the title is
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:31.960]   The homepage and Yahoo is the is the killer on all of this it's ran it generates hundreds of millions of views a month
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.760]   And so none of the verticals had a chance unless they got on the home page
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:42.520]   Yes, and the guys who could say always call right and the and the the gatekeepers are controlled the home page
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:50.360]   Said look I don't care what you put on there Kim Kardashian's but it's gonna go always drive you know 10x the traffic
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:55.920]   So it doesn't matter and it's kind of in a way. It's a statement about not so much old media new media
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.800]   But the kind of the what drives traffic on the internet
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.000]   I
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   C clicked on Kim's butt
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.440]   But I also did other read you know, I read David Pogue stuff. I read you know, yeah
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.960]   All right, you wonder what happens to
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:17.120]   One of those big contracts they have
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.840]   Let us let's wrap this up
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:23.720]   Alrighty, I
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:28.840]   Don't know what I was gonna do for a tool. Did you put a thousand dollars down on a new Tesla?
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:36.280]   No, you know, here's here. I never ending saw my car is about a hundred ninety nine thousand miles. It's about to collapse I
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.800]   What four-wheel drive? I want Android Auto. I don't want to spend a fortune
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:47.160]   Then I got interested. I thought so I read any review. I wish I remember who wrote it
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.320]   Okay, we're gonna write it. Uh, sorry
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.560]   That's that favorably compared the Chevy bolt
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:58.120]   Yeah, I'm interested in the bolt and the boat does Android auto
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.360]   Has Android auto says the technology in some ways is is more interesting
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.240]   um
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:12.360]   And and I thought okay, well be cool. It's cool. What's cooler than by in a Tesla by in a bolt being, you know
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.200]   Just just a Chevy
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.920]   Yeah, you know, just be different from the same price same roughly
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.200]   I tweet this and somebody's well. Oh, no man. You gotta live in California. Who knows what's coming to the East Coast?
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.960]   Oh, really? They're only selling the bolt in the California said my Twitter feed
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.160]   I don't know
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:37.040]   There's no sense of when it's coming out or anything else but but the problem is now I look from from where I am to my daughter's college
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:42.520]   Is a hundred ninety miles and the bolt's posing its 210 miles. You can't get home though
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.240]   That's well. Yeah that and then do I do I safely get there?
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:53.780]   Um and then how many hours it takes to fully charge
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:02.580]   It's still not practical. It's still kind of ridiculous including including the Tesla. It's not practical. Well, you don't deposit
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.000]   No, because I have remember I'm sitting on a
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   A model X which I may never get I don't if you've been following the coverage of that apparently
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.880]   Some real trouble making the model X
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:20.320]   The roadshow now is reporting that a new email sent to a Tesla Motors Club forum user
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.840]   I'm on the Tesla Motors Club contains language
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.680]   That could be seen as concerning
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:33.320]   Because a chance they'll just they'll just skip the X and say all the money is obviously in the three
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:39.920]   Sorry folks change our mind. You know, at least you don't have empty hummus container
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:45.480]   They said so even the letter came from Elon I think but they've only made two thousand X's, right?
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.320]   They had hoped to make many more by this time
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.360]   saying
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360]   They said for instance
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.160]   We often take proactive measures to ensure the best driving and ownership experience possible
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.840]   for our customers
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.680]   and
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.360]   Maybe we showed some hubris in adding far too much new technology to this car
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.840]   a bit of
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.000]   humility severe model X supplier parts shortage and
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.440]   hubris in adding far too much new technology
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.440]   Oh
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:30.160]   When does your lease run out September
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.480]   Lock is ticking. I may be driving a pickup truck in September come September
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:41.240]   Google self-driving bike
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:49.800]   chatroom is speculating I think they're probably right that the the reason that the iPad stopped is I'd reach the limit of
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:58.760]   The memory that it could store of this. Oh, so when I said upload the video it meant upload the video. Yeah, I don't know if it's all
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.640]   Oh, that's weird. Why would it why would it store it locally? Oh well has to what is it gonna do? Oh?
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.920]   I see what you're saying. Yeah, no, you're right. It doesn't have to because it's could just dream it
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.160]   But they do they there's an option to save it. So
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.640]   That's why so anyway, it's it's on there
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.200]   By the way, Lisa liked yours, but didn't like mine
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.800]   so
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:25.280]   Why oh I see she didn't like it capital she enjoyed it, but she didn't like it. She liked you
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.600]   She reshared you so 16,600 views 1,300 comments
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.400]   And it really was kind of not a very satisfying experience
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.160]   I'm sure for those watching because it was just kind of one one side of the conversation
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:44.520]   Well, no, didn't you get they could hear me too? Could they sort of yeah, but not great and I rearranged the monitor
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.340]   So they could kind of see you and all that and the people on this side couldn't couldn't hear a thing right here
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:54.400]   Me every right every you know 90 some telling you hot tub tech machine later this afternoon
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:03.280]   It's a hot day here. It's like 80 or 90 degrees here. Oh shut up. It's 22 degrees. I know I heard you get a second winner
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.720]   Second winner
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.920]   You lucked out so much in the weather with you here. I know it was really pleasant
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.960]   Really pleasant and I think we lucked out seeing Hamilton too because come July that you know
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.360]   The old gang's gonna break up. They've got a truck tour coming up that will start in San Francisco
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:28.480]   They've got a Chicago show. They're building now. They there was a good article in the New York Times about the producer
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.760]   the they call him the CEO of Hamilton and
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:36.320]   What a business a hit-hot Broadway show could make more money than a hit movie
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:43.120]   In the long run they expect a lot of yeah, they're making they're making half a million dollars a week
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:49.480]   On just that box office of course when they open the other shows and all the
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:53.400]   Soundtrack and all that it's really interesting
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:58.280]   Ladies and gentlemen
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.200]   Let's wrap this up with a number of the week. Okay. What should I do here? You've got some good ones
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:09.880]   Yeah, I was to one just for the record is that an eighty five million dollar patent role suit against
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.760]   Google they lost in the lower court was thrown out on appeal. So just just
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:21.480]   Ring the bell for the good guys. Good. Good. Um, the other the other was the patch. Do you know? Oh?
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.040]   No, I forget. Hold on. Yeah, that's all right
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:34.760]   Was it you know, is that basic Texas court case where yeah Tyler Texas? Yep. Yep old Tyler Tyler Texas
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:38.840]   It's taken forever to come up. That's all right. There we go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.480]   It was a 1996 desktop notification system
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:51.400]   And the and the higher court said the lower court basically didn't know how to read a
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.560]   Patent Wow
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.800]   So that's good news
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:03.960]   Somebody's telling me that the the other number of the week should be seven and a half billion dollars
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:09.720]   That's the model three pre-order. Yeah, total so far
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.880]   How many of those gonna stick, you know, if you if you're
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:20.280]   Elon, what do you start to plan for because you're gonna have to go borrow a hell of a lot of money now, right?
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.800]   Just feed that supply chain
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.200]   Well, but he can because he has 276,000 orders. It should be easy to go to the
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.360]   Markets and say give me money, right? Yeah for some amount of that
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:36.760]   Even if you said okay half of them will cancel half of them, right? It is a refully refundable deposits
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:42.600]   Um, but I think the fact there were these long lines and they got so many in such a short time
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.000]   Tells you that there is a lot of demand for this
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.920]   My wife laughed at the because the mall here in new jersey of short hills had a pad
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.440]   They had local TV and and it was all just you know
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:57.640]   48-year-old doughy white guys well, well, you know like us
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:06.120]   Doughy is a doughy is a good word for the new hot tub tech machine coming soon
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.400]   Watch the dough cook
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.280]   I'm like a bagel bagel
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.080]   Be to it
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.640]   Uh
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:22.840]   I don't think I have a tool this week. I was I mean I have a few tools. I've been I have been a Facebook live
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.120]   Facebook live is clearly the
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.240]   The tool of the week. I've been playing a little bit more with
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.960]   Linux and things like this revolve thing what microsoft has done
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:38.760]   um with uh the windows 10 forced upgrade
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.880]   apples kind of
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.120]   Clear indifference towards its desktop platform, you know, it's all about the phone
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:53.720]   Has kind of made me think I really probably should start looking at another operating system, you know, the best desktop the the
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:31:00.360]   Without anybody knowing it the year of desktop Linux happened with with chromo s that is linux
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.680]   And uh, and it's if you can't really install anything on it
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:07.240]   No, but it's really gets you most of the way there
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.280]   It is linux and a lot of the merits of it are based on on the fact that it's based on the on linux
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:21.000]   So people and android is linux as well. So google's done a lot to put linux in the mainstream, but I thought I wouldn't mind finding a desktop linux
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.120]   That would give me all of the
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:33.000]   Stuff I get from os 10 or windows now actually just as I start engaged in this process microsoft
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.600]   announced that they're going to put the bash shell in
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.720]   Windows 10 which is really good news for web developers anybody who's used to the the the Unix tool chain
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:49.240]   And most developers want some sort of Unix tool chain that means windows is no longer, you know
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.720]   Out of the question a lot of people bought max a lot of web developers use max just because that
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:56.360]   Because they have the bash shell they have a command line
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.560]   So i've been shopping around and with lots of help from our chat room
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.320]   I've tried a lot of different distributions of course your first one you go to as a bun too
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:08.040]   A lot of people say linux mint that's the most popular distribution right now on distro watch
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:12.280]   But there's security reasons. I'm not sure I want to go with linux mint
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.840]   They block some of the upstream updates and so forth for compatibility reasons a bun too
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.560]   Also in a way kind of gets out of date
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.720]   Fast if you do this stable release you're going to be out of date on a lot of stuff
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:28.040]   Then I looked at debbie in which is what a bun too and mint are based on
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:32.680]   And that's a pretty nice operating system if you use the debbie and stretch version
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:37.960]   They have debbie knows it right they have a stable version that this tends to be older, but it's very rock solid
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:42.040]   Uh, and then and then somebody told me oh you should use arch limits
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.520]   That's a build it yourself linux and I did build an arch system
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:49.160]   You have to be a linux guru to do it and finally somebody told me about this. This is on tergos
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.960]   Ontario this from spain
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:55.000]   And it is a linux distribution
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.960]   That is arch
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:03.160]   But it's pre-configured to be very easy and friendly to use and actually I really
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:06.360]   Really like it. I put it on two machines now
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   And I think anybody looking to get both a rolling updated linux a linux like arch that is constantly up to date
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:19.880]   But a user interface that is agreeable easy to use and remember you've got a full
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.680]   You know a free
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:26.360]   Office suite libra office you've got a lot of the tools that you use
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:31.800]   If you put chromium on it that's identical to google chrome in fact you log in with google
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.560]   And you sync it with your stuff and all of your every one of your
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.560]   chrome
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.560]   Things works. I mean this is a really
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:45.080]   Uh, you know your chrome extension works is a really a friendly nice linux. I've been very happy with it
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:49.960]   An tergos and like all linacies they're free. Although they have a patreon
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.120]   You can be a patreon and I decided to be a five dollar month patreon supporter for that
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.640]   Um, everybody will say they have their own favorite
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:03.720]   But I think this is this is pretty impressive and then I also wanted to mention that they got one of the founders of
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.080]   Uh opera has released his
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:13.960]   New browser. It's been in beta for some time, but vivaldi is now out at vivaldi.com
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:19.160]   And this is a uh, an interesting browser. It's very customizable
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.760]   Uh, I don't I it's not going to replace chrome for me
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:29.000]   But uh, it has some features that you might kind of like including gestures and quick commands
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.640]   Uh a better management of tabs
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:34.680]   Uh a note taker built in
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:40.360]   And it's uh, it's compatible with plugins. I think it's compatible with the firefox plugins
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.200]   I have to have to check on that
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.880]   But you might you know, there's it's good. There's always room for a new browser
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:53.560]   Vivaldi 1.0 is now out and it's also like uh, like uh, linux. It's also free and yeah, it's good
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.120]   to have more competition to push the feature sets. I agree
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:00.760]   There's some really interesting features in here. Have you what was the last time you used firefox?
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.880]   I tried every once in a while. I just I can't I chrome is so perfect for what I want
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:11.320]   It is. I really like chrome. Of course. I can't use anything else. Yeah, because you're on a chrome book. Yeah, yeah
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.520]   um
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.400]   So a couple of picks
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.520]   But I have to say I've been very very happy with it dare ghost
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.800]   Which gives us kind of the build it yourself features of arch with a uh, a nice kind of set of
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:32.280]   Preconfigured starting points and you can choose from uh cinnamon, which is the mint desktop
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:37.800]   If you want a real windows like desktop, there's ganelum. There's kde. There's mate. There's a lot of good desktops on
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.360]   All right
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.200]   I think we can wrap this up
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.760]   Jeff jarfis typey always a pleasure
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.960]   You'll find jeff at buzz machine.com
