[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:06.360]   If it's in the cloud we'll cover it. Gina Trepani is here from ThinkUp.com founding editor of Life Hacker hosted all about Android.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   You guys had a great show yesterday with Miriam Schwar. That was great to see her.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   Yeah, yeah it was a good show. Always have fun. I'll buy a show.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.360]   Also here Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York in his office at CUNY.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   And time just got something exciting today. I got my new book.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   Oh, congratulations.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   Geek's Bearing Gifts imagining new futures for news.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Where can we get that book Jeff Jarvis?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   It's pretty wonky but it's what I do for a living.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   And this was the white paper you were talking about.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   This is the white paper the metastasized. Yes.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Awesome. Hey wait a minute. I hear a familiar sounding laugh.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   Couldn't be Matt missed. It's Matt Cutz and he's holding two dinosaurs.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   Hello everybody. Welcome Matt.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   I almost said Googler Matt Cutz but you're going to leave a absence right now which seems to be going on.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   Yeah, it's very relaxing with the cat. Isn't that nice?
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   Matt as many of you know by now Matt is a early early employee at Google who does such a great job fighting spam on the search results.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.360]   And so the story at Search Engine Land was that you're on a leave of absence which you may extend it in next year.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   Yeah, so Google has been really generous.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   You know they occasionally will let folks go on leave for up to three months.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   And so that would have been earlier in October and talk to them.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   And there's still some stuff that I'm working on and that my family needs me for.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   And so we're extending that leave into 2015.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   So nice thing is, well it has been good.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   Yeah, I've gotten to go on Alaska Cruise with my family and visit Portland for XOXO in New York.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   It's been wonderful. But they also the other good thing is that the team is in really good hands.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   There's a strong deep bench of people who really know how to fight spam well both on the algorithmic side and on the manual spam side.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   So they don't need me there and they've been doing a great job while I'm on leave.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   I think you're just being a great husband.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   You're right.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   You're trying to rack up husband points.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   You're right on your blog.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   Actually, you wrote this back in July when you announced the leave.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   When I joined Google, my wife and I agreed that I'd worked for four to five years.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   How many years was it?
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   It's been 14 now.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   Okay.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   And then she'd get to see more of me.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.360]   I talked about this as recently as Matt last month and as early as 2006.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.360]   Now almost 15 years later.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   I'm going to take a little time off.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   That's not it.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   Do they call it a sabbatical?
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   I mean, it's kind of like a sabbatical.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   Technically they call it a leave, but the HR department at Google is very good about trying to work with people and trying to figure out, you know, what's the best way to make things work for everybody involved.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   And you're not checking your work email at all.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.360]   I've done a pretty good job of not replying to work email.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   It's really hard to not even read work email.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.360]   And it's especially hard not to read Google news because, you know, I'm incredibly interested in all the stuff in the cloud and everything going on.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.360]   So I still kind of read all the things going on in Europe and, you know, the NSA news and all that sort of stuff.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:37.360]   It certainly looked like Dr. Evil in that chair with your.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   One million dollars.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   But she does this all the time.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   And he loves to perch on me and she'll walk around with me around the house.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.360]   That's a perfect cat.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   She's enjoyed me being around the house.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.360]   I wish cats liked me more, but they really they could take her leave me.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.360]   That's why you have a small dog on you.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   Yeah, the dog.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   Well, is that why?
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   I think it's more about the cat than anything else.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   I think it's great that you're extending extending your leave.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   And I mean, you know, not speaking just totally generally.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   I feel like the work life balance thing is kind of like one of the dirty little secrets of our industry.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   Like I think it's just so easy to get sucked into.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   I mean, there's so many exciting things going on, especially your position at Google.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   There's that, you know, so easy to just get kind of sucked into work.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   But I think it's great that you're you're taking a break.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   And of course, like we know you as the face of Google as so many so many people do.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   But also like I like when you're just Matt, like I love your experiment stuff.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.360]   I love your personal blog when you're writing about, you know, your own stuff.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   And so I'm I'm off for you being maximum Matt and whatever, even if that means, you know, out of the context of Google, I think it's great.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   Thank you so much.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.360]   And so so Gina is doing a 30 day challenge or has been writing a lot more on scribbling.net.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   And that inspired me.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   So my 30 day challenge this month is to write at least once a day.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.360]   So I've been warming up with little simple stuff and it's it's good.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   You know, there's sort of a renaissance of people like Andy Bayo and a bunch of people writing more often on their own blogs.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360]   And that's that's a good thing too.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   So how if only the blog would come back if only.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:27.360]   I've actually failed miserably at doing it every single day, but I decided it's not going to be an absolute like pass fail thing that it's going to be an ongoing just, you know, if I didn't do it yesterday do it today anyway kind of thing because I tend to get to that.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   I keep the engineering thing where I'm like, well, it failed.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   The whole thing is broken.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   I didn't do it, you know.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   I know exactly what you mean.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   I'm just trying again, try again today.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   What have some of your challenges been so let's see the gone, Matt.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   Well, here's one.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   This is his Halloween costume.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   Oh, dear.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360]   Yes.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   Edvard Munch is the scream.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   I've been playing around with a projector and canvases.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   There's also one that I did about the shining, which really makes me look crazy.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   I think the SEO is the search engine optimizers, you know, they love whenever I act like a dinosaur or something because they get used to the part.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   Here's Johnny.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   Wow.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   That's amazing.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360]   Wow.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   I think you need to go back to work soon, Matt.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   Yeah, maybe so.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   All work and no play max, Matt, adult boy.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   Wow.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   Did you, but now you can't bring a projector with you.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   For how amazing.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   No, but what I did for the, the scream was I projected the painting on a canvas and then I traced it.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   And then I could just, I repainted the scream myself.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   And so if you look it up close, it's really awful quality, but it's like a paint by numbers, you know, version of the scream.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   Which is the real one.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   And then I have the canvas.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   There you go.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   So you can see the hole where I would stick my head.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   So it's, it's pretty fun to just tinker around, you know, make the sunset look about the rock, right?
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   You know, I'm out.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   That's what it's.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   So this is, this is exclusive content.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   Nobody else has this boy.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   The making of.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   So you decided not to do the hang in there kitten poster.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   I take it.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   No, that was an field experiment.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   You know, I'm trying to be more okay.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   If you show that picture, I'm trying to be more okay with publicly failing.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   Like I did a blog post about hitting the wall at a recent marathon.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   And how unblocking.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   So, yeah.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   So do you think when you, when you go, when you go back in the same role at Google, do you think?
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   Or maybe this is a chance for you to try something else?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   Well, I really have been impressed with how well everyone else on the team is doing.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   And it's created a little bit of an opportunity for them to try new things, explore different stuff, you know, approach problems from a different way.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   And so, you know, we'll have to see how it goes.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   I loved the part of my job that it dealt with, you know, keeping an eye on what important news was happening related to Google.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   But, you know, it's not clear that having me as a lightning rod, you know, for, you know, unhappy black cat SEOs or something is the best use of anybody time compared to, you know, working on other things that could be making the world better for Google or in general.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   So we'll see how it all works.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   What an opportunity, you know, to be at somewhere like Google and to have, obviously you have their trust and say, "Hey, maybe I want to try my hand at that."
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   Do you actually get to do that? You're senior enough now. You must be able to say, "Could I do this?"
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   The interesting thing is at Google, they try to get you to go and do different projects.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.360]   So the product managers, they encourage you to rotate every two or three years.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   And so it's relatively rare to find people who have been around, you know, forever in a specific area.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   Now you'll find Ahmed in Search, Sridhar in ads, you know, some of these people that are really, really senior, you know, higher ranking than me for sure.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   They do stick around in one area.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   But a lot of other people jump to different parts of the company to burnish different skills and try different things, which is a pretty good idea, I think.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   We talked last week, didn't we, on about those poor Facebook folks who have to look at all the crap that...
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   And so we thought of you, Matt, because it's like, "Well, Matt has to do a little bit of that too."
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   Although we figured by now you have minions who will be actually looking at the spam as opposed to doing...
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   I prefer colleagues, but...
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   [laughter]
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   If we were commenting on your sunny disposition...
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   In the face of the underbelly of the internet, even as in the abstract, even if you're not, you know, deleting child porn, you know, manually yourself, Matt.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   Well, and I just have so much admiration for...
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   For example, last year there was a real effort on child porn because of some stuff that happened in the United Kingdom.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   And a lot of people chipped in, and that is not an easy job at all.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   So, you know, you have to think hard about how you're going to tackle those kinds of things.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   So, you're kind of a polymath, but you've been in the same department.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   What other things interest you, Matt?
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.360]   What other things...
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   Oh, man.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   I was computer graphics and actually, you know, inertial trackers and accelerometers in grad school.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   Really?
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:43.360]   And at one point I said, "Oh, yeah, I said, you know, you could use commodity hardware, but as a grad student, you don't have access to influence anybody's mind.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.360]   So why don't I just go do something else for ten years and somebody else will come up with all these sensors?"
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   And sure enough, you've got Connect, you know, the Wii, you know, the iPhone, how everybody's got a computer in their pocket that can do 3D sensing as long as you write the computer program as well.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   So, there's all kinds of interesting stuff you could do.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   Andy Rubin has left Google.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   Of course, he was the guy who created Android, brought it to Google.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   And ran Android for some time last year. He left and went to robotics in the...
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   We think it was in the Google Pro X stuff.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   And now he's going off to do something probably with robotics related on his own.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   I think it's not unusual. In fact, I think the commentary when he left was, "This is normal. This is what happens."
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   In some ways, we hope this is what happens, is that people kind of grow and move on, maybe to other things, and then kind of extend the Google connections out into the rest of the world.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   You won't leave Google, though.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   Let's not put that on the spot.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   Oh, I want to put them on the spot.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Oh, let's not put them on the spot.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   I'll always have a connection and a soft spot for Google.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   I think that's the idea.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   What interesting is...
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   It's fun to watch a Twig or two ago. You know I listened while running to this week in Google.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   And it's really fun to hear how you guys interpret various things in the criminology of trying to reverse engineer why this person is doing that or something is really fun.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   It's definitely the case, like this interview with Larry Page in the Financial Times.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.360]   It's neat to have that perspective of maybe a little bit better guess about what Larry was thinking about.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   Yeah, that was actually a great interview.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   And I think it is probably timed around Sundar Pichai's promotion and the idea that Larry will have fewer direct reports and be able to think more about the high-level stuff.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   Freeing himself up to think big is how the Financial Times...
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   My favorite part of this was saying, "Google, you can't imagine a bigger mission statement than Google's, yet he wants a bigger mission."
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:11.360]   Right. The original mission was what to organize all the world's information and make it accessible, universally accessible and useful.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   That's pretty big.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:29.360]   It's a function of cash flow. I love Google, obviously I do this show and I think the intentions are good, but Google has a great business with lots of money in the bank, which gives them the opportunity to look at those big challenges.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   And I'm so glad that they are.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:39.360]   But there are very few companies that can make that leap to make those kinds of investments.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   That's kind of exactly what Larry said when the Times FT asked him what the new mission statement would be.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   He said, "Well, we're still trying to work that out.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   We have $62 billion in cash. We're in a bit of uncharted territory. We're trying to figure it out.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   How do we use all these resources and have a more positive impact on the world?"
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   Boy, that would be a fun company to be at, I think Matt.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.360]   Yeah, that's filed under good problems to have.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   Right.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   I'm reading a book, which is a great book called Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   Which is a fun book, yeah.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   I'm reading it right now.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   It's kind of like, I don't know the end of it, so I can't spoil it for you.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   But it's a novel about a company, actually a consortium of the biggest data companies in the world who just basically say, forget the NSA, we're going to collect everything about everybody and store it.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   And it's one of those, it's like the worst paranoid fantasy.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   So if you're a privacy buff or privacy advocate, this is what you fear.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   Yeah, but as opposed to other dystopian novels of the current time, this one had a rye touch and it was fun.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   Oh, I love it.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   And that attitude drives me nuts, but I enjoyed the book a lot.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   And it is, I mean, I think it's pretty clear that the evil person in the book is kind of a Bill Gates type, working in a Google type company would be my play on it.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   But these are the fears I think some people have, yes?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   That Google might be, have an overarching ambition that goes beyond what we're comfortable with.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   And I read another one recently, which was the opposite, when I can't run the title right now, in which the opposite happens, that everything gets controlled.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   And we don't get the freedom to share and dystopia in a couple, or any dystopia as alternate number.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   Right. And there's always the extreme.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   I'm not going to ask Matt this because this would put him on the spot, but obviously you trust Google because you work there and you more than many are inside Google and understand kind of a little more what the motivations are.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   It's interesting too, because like, I think a lot of people view Google as a monolith and I tend to view it more like almost like separate silos, you know, there's search, there's Chrome, there's Android, there's social or Google.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   Plus there's YouTube.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   And each silo or department, whatever you want to call it within the company is good at certain things and not as good at other things.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   And so search is fantastic at artificial intelligence, machine learning, as it relates to search at least, and handling things really, really fast.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   Whereas two or three generations ago when you went to go order your Nexus 4, maybe the store couldn't handle load or something like that.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   But then there's other parts of Google are good at other things.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   And so I think at least I can only speak for core search, but one of the things that core search has always believed in is trying to have a level playing field and things like takeout so that if you don't like Google, you can leave, which forces us to compete honestly.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   And so I totally understand why some people are like, okay, I'm worried about ambition or disruption, but as long as a company has to earn your loyalty and there's not lock-in, that's to me the big promise that makes it such that you don't have to work at Google for 14 years to know that it's trustworthy because you can go anywhere else.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   Because I know you and I trust you, I do trust Google, but I have to say when you say when your mission goes from, we just want to be great search and organize the world's information, something that everybody can kind of get behind to, well, now we've got a lot of money, so let's get more ambitious.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   It starts to raise a little bit of a rip.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   No, I think it's the opposite Leo, I thought that it was saying now we have a responsibility to give back and to use science and engineering to solve problems and do neat things and help.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   Yeah, but who decides, I mean, who decides what government does it I don't know either, but who decides what is altruistic for a societal benefit?
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   The guy with a money, the guy's right in the check.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   Yeah, yeah, but that's one thing that I do love about Larry is he wants to make a big difference, you know, maybe not just one dent in the universe but multiple dent in the universe.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   And his mode of thinking, you know, from the outside from what I can tell seems to be, okay, well, what's causing the biggest suffering?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   What do people die of?
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   What is causing the most harm?
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:41.360]   And maybe, and he did a pretty good job of enunciating that in his Financial Times interview and he's done that, those interviews with Ted.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   And if those are the kinds of motives, then you can understand, okay, self-driving cars, you know, a lot of people die because of accidents, you know, or calico trying to tackle disease or, you know, these new nanoparticles that could go around and spot diseases much, much earlier.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   And it just seems like there's so many moonshots or ten times thing, ten times improvements that everybody would be like, yes, healthier people.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   And then you can certainly, you know, argue over the relative, you know, priorities of some stuff, but there's still a lot of, not low hanging fruit, but seemingly mission and impossible things that have yet to really be tackled the way that they could be tackled.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.360]   Yeah, I would hope that he has good advisors and is doing this.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   Well, here's, I'll give you an example so they're worried me a little bit in the FT article.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   He says, given the chance to give up work, nine out of ten people, quote, wouldn't want to be doing what they're doing today.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   And that's, yes, but then it's not an attempt.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360]   People are out of work.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   He wants.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.360]   Well, he predicts he predicts radical deflation.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   I asked.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.360]   Oh, frozen Jeff and Dree.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.360]   No.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   Oh, I'm glad that's not just me.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.360]   No, it's Jeff.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   You asked Mark and reason what.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   Larry also talked about radical deflation.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   Yeah, prices will come down because of it greater efficiency.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   Well, well, that could bring some really disruptive forces into society and may not be all good.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   But he saw it as a positive saying that things will get cheaper.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   People will have more time.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   Now, this people will have more time.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   Trope has been predicted often.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   I don't know whether it's true or not, but I do agree that as you've heard recently made on the show, technology leads to efficiency over growth.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   And I think that's part of what he's saying.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   Well, and Jeff, you had a really good piece from 2011 called the Jobless Future.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   I think that basically talks about how technology leads to all kinds of improvements, but not automatically to more jobs.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   And Eric Schmidt gets kind of this reputation for saying things that are true, but maybe not as polite or something like that.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   And you've got government saying we're going to create as many jobs as possible.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   And I think a lot of technologists are like, is the objective to create jobs or is the objective to do the best possible thing that you can do?
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   And yes, there's absolutely some tension inherent there.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   And I think Leo, you're right to put your thumb on it and say, wait a second, what if you're a telephone operator or a truck driver and suddenly switching is automatic or in 50 years or whatever computers can drive cars more effectively?
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   He also says he defends.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   Yeah, and he says you can't wish these things away because they're going to happen.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   You're going to have some very amazing capabilities in the economy when we have computers that could do more and more jobs is going to change how we think about work.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   There's no way around it. You can't wish it away.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:42.360]   And those are the right words. And then I would hope that he would start to think about, well, what happens?
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   He says, I mean, I don't think the answer is, oh, this is fine because everything's going to get so cheap that you don't need a job.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   He's not an answer that I think a lot of people want to hear.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   Yeah, and I personally agree with you. I think saying that there's disruption coming in the future and that is a two-edged sword and disruption helps in a lot of ways and disruption helps, hurts a lot of incumbents and hurts a lot of industries and can hurt people if they don't prepare for it.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:16.360]   And then maybe the next part of that could be and how do we all talk about or begin the conversation of how to prepare that together.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   And I agree. And I think that's that you have my friends in publishing, especially German publishing, who go after Google as if that was our money. You took it away from us. You owe us something.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   I couldn't disagree with that more. But I would agree that having had a disruptive impact on, for example, news and the media industry, I think Google has some more, if not moral, but an ethical responsibility
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   and opportunity to help rethink the future. And so you have Larry Page having tremendous gifts, gifts of intellect, gifts of his fields of science and now gifts of cash.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   And I'm not saying he should go give it to actual Springer or they should give it to, oh, I don't know, CUNY. It's not like a Bill Gates thing.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   I would argue that what we need in these industries is the best of Silicon Valley's innovation and investment to rethink what they ought to be, what they can be. Not the current players, not the legacy players.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   There's no right that they should continue in their old power. But for Google to tackle big questions like how do we solve disease? How do we stop people from dying in cars? How do we have a more informed society?
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   Things like that, I think is now a kind of give back. And you can do it the Bill Gates way where you say, I got a big bucket load of money and I'm going to put my sparks to use it that way.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   Or you can do it when I think Larry is much younger is to say, well, while I'm still in this company, while I have this incredible powerhouse, how can we harness that?
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:55.360]   And that's the difference that scares me a little bit. Now, I'm going to call on you the historian, Jeff, because there have been plutocrats before.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   There were the robber barons. There have been very, very wealthy men before. And I think Bill Gates is one model where you make a pile of money, you put it in the bank, and then you retire and you give it to charity.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   And what he's doing is not to build a business around that, but just giving it all away.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   What Larry's proposing is a little more scary to me. And I wonder if there's a precedent for this where you have somebody like Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, these very extraordinary, and I guess,
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   I don't know about Apple, if there's a guy at Apple like that, I guess not. But these extraordinary wealthy guys who instead of saying, I'm just going to make this money, put it in the bank, and then when I retire, give it away, who say, I'm going to rebuild society.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   Easy. Heavily forward Thomas Edison.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   And what happened? Thomas Edison invented a whole bunch of cool stuff.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   And got very wealthy. And then what do you do with the money? Did he say, now I'm going to change the world and I'm going to remake the world in the new, in my own vision?
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   He kept doing what he did to improve the world. He kept inventing.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   Yes. Now, Henry Ford was more of the more of the megalomaniac style where I'm going to reinvent the world.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   He got a sort of new Utopia in Brazil. Didn't work out so great.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:15.360]   Didn't work so well, did it? No. No. So that's what worries me is that, look, Larry's obviously brilliant.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   And I think Google is fantastic. But I worry that somebody now suddenly has a lot of power, influence and money.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   And when you're giving money to charity, it's a little different because you're working within the system.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:34.360]   Now, it's almost as if he wants to create his own system. And that's like, that's, that's, that's, I still got this, that's Bill Gates saying, okay, I'm done.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   And now I'll take my cash lump. And don't forget, Bill Gates is using his intelligence and trying to change the world in important ways with his money.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   But the charitable system in this country isn't all that great. It's better, it's more developed and better than it is in other countries.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   But it has its own problems of legacy and stick of the mud and bureaucracy and entrenched interests and all kinds of things.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   Charity's aren't all wonderful.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   Well, and somebody's pointing out that, of course, the other thing Henry Ford did is he started the Foreign Foundation, which to this day is really a valuable asset in the world.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   But I guess the only thing I'd add is that Google has a couple advantages in that you've got a critical mass of smart people and they have tried to have a culture of don't be evil.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:26.360]   And you can argue over individual incidents and whether, you know, this specific thing is evil or that specific thing is evil.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:33.360]   But Google as a whole, whenever I look at the DNA, the people try to do the right things.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:49.360]   And so if you've got Larry marching off in one direction and you've got the rest of the company saying, "No, we disagree and they drag their heels and they create friction," in my opinion helps to move things toward a consensus of maybe a middle ground, which works pretty well.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   And then having that critical mass of smart people lets you say, "Oh, now I can do voice recognition better. Now I can do image recognition better and I can unlock all kinds of good applications to improve the world that way."
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   Whereas if you just have money, Larry said, "So it's a tough call." Like Gina says, "It's a good problem to have, I guess."
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   It's like we get rooted on a Unix system for the first time. I mean, the thing you see with great power comes great responsibility. Google has root.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   I think, you know, and I think that the fear is like, you know, what are they going to do? Are they going to be responsible?
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   And I like the idea that there's checks and balances and that there's critical mass of smart people. I just, you know, the evil thing is like, you know, technology.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   The thing that I've understood, and now I'm very pro technology, the thing that I'm reminded of constantly is like technology itself isn't good or evil, right?
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   Like it just is. And it's what you do with it. And like, there's a lot of nuance around that.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:52.360]   And of course I like that Google aspires to don't be evil. But I think it really comes down to just folks feeling, you know, there's this weird fear of the power of the power of the people.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   And I think it's a weird fear of the powerful nerd thing, you know, that I read your email t-shirt.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:05.360]   And I think society, a culture is going to outgrow that to some degree, especially when these legacy institutions sort of die off.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   And, you know, we move forward. But I think some of the distrust is just kind of like, you know, there's a lot of opportunities here for one company to change the world and let's hope it's in the best ways.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   Also from this Financial Times article, Paige relates a frequent debate. He said he had with Steve Jobs, who died three years ago, Paige said he would always tell me you're doing too much stuff to Google.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:37.360]   And Paige would say, I'd be like, you're not doing enough stuff. The argument he made to Jobs, it's unsatisfying to have all these people.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   And we have all these billions we should be investing to make people's lives better. If we just do the same things we did before and don't do something new, it seems like a crime to me.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   I think that's important. There's another model here, Leo, which is Bell Labs. Bell Labs did fund a good deal of pure research that led to some, you know, astronomy had nothing to do with Bell Labs, but they had astronomers there.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   They had amazing scientists there. Google has phenomenal scientists and engineers there. And to unleash their problem-solving power on the problems they find and to support them while doing that.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   Some of those problems will solve the problems that Google has, like cheaper power.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:26.360]   Cheaper power is good for everybody and it's darn good for Google. The transistor was good for everybody and it was good for AT&T.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   The network was good for everybody and AT&T didn't realize how good it could have been for them.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   But we don't have a Bell Labs now. And, you know, another way to look at it is what if Google started beyond Project X, a pure research arm, the size of Bell Labs?
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.360]   That would be something.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   Still a lot of trust. Larry Page is not an elected official. Not necessarily. That makes it more trustworthy.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   Well, if you're back to Google, all bets are off.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   I sense a distrust of the pace of politics and the pace of government in all of Silicon Valley. Hey, no, why don't you take it so long? We're just going to go and launch it and do it.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.360]   Neil on Musk's same thing.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.360]   Yes. There's a reason, I believe, there's a reason why government moves so slowly and deliberately.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   Is it always ours right now?
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.360]   Yeah. I think that it's better to move slowly than it is to move too quickly.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   In theory, yes, but now we're a complete...
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:35.360]   Well, I think it's also better to reach consensus. And I think the problem you have when you have these very powerful plutocrats is they don't need to reach consensus.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   This is not an indictment of Google or Larry Page. It's just a general fear that you've got a lot of power.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   And just saying, don't be evil, it's a good start.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   But it really has to be in your DNA and what is evil and what isn't evil.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   And ultimately, as a publicly held company, your fiduciary responsibility is to your stakeholders.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:09.360]   Right now, there's the Four Square Conference going on in New York, which is not Four Square, what we know, but Four Square from Lazard.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   And I'm missing right now Rupert Murdoch talking there.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   There's another example of using his money.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   Too much power.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.360]   What he thinks is right, but I think is often abhorrent.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   And yeah, he can go both ways.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   Or Bloomberg used his money to become an incredible technocrat.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.360]   Did he win his proposition to text so many people?
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   I don't even know.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   I think it got overturned by a court.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   No, no, but now there was an initiative.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   He said, well, I don't care. I'm going to do it in an initiative.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   That's a good example of a guy who for some reason is really decided that soda pop is the enemy.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   There's some health data that says that.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   There's some to say that.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   There's good support.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   It seems like the saving grace for me for Google is just that for the most part, if you don't like it, no one forces you to come to your house and use Google.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:15.360]   We have to compete on the merits and people would use other options on Gmail and Google Docs and all this stuff you have to compete well.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   Whereas if you're stuck with network effects, suppose you wanted to leave Facebook or Twitter, it doesn't matter how nice Facebook or Twitter is.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   If all the people are there, it's a little harder to leave on that.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:35.360]   Bloomberg's one cent tax on soda in Berkeley was passed.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   Measure D.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   It was in Berkeley, by the way, not New York.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   But he put the money into it.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   We're better to pick the best.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.360]   Start with Berkeley.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.360]   The American Beverage Association says.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   It's interesting that Bloomberg put the money into that.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   Measure D because I guess he figured, well, we'll get it passed here and then slowly stretch across the country.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   Yeah, I don't want to put you in an awkward position.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   This is a great article with Larry Page.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   I think you're absolutely right, Matt, that it's nice to see into what he's thinking.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   I hope that he remains this public, engages the public in the conversation.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   Because I think this is something that no one person should have too much power in.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   Of course, he's got the company.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   He says he wants to build a bigger company than has ever been built before, in a sense.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   There are limits on how big companies can get.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   The biggest companies, quote, are all within an order of magnitude of the same size, certainly in market cap.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   So he says these are the limits against which his company is pushing.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   You say we're going to take over all these important things.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.360]   There's no example of a company doing that.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   But I feel like he wants to.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   Don't know.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   Well, if you want to have impact, then you would be the applicant.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.360]   And it feels like there's another interesting way to look at it.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   I'll stop soon, but there's forward-looking and backward-looking.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   Like forward-looking would be, I'm going to scan all the books and hope that people see the value to society
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   by the time the cast is done, which they did.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   And then there's backwards-looking, which is, hey, let's fix money in politics or campaign finance reform.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:26.360]   And to me, that's a helpful lens to look at, whether it's Elon Musk or Peter D. Hymondas or Larry or Bill Gates
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   or whoever is like forward-looking versus trying to fix the things that are-
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   Larry Lessig has been a lot of energy trying to fix the campaign finance system.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   And I think that's a worthy effort.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   I don't know.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   I just- It's being nervous when somebody has too much power.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.360]   That's why our government has designed the way it is.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   It's designed to be hobbled.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   But it's also innovation is power, right?
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.360]   Intelligence is power, science is power.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   I just finished listening to Walter Isaacson's book, which is good.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   For you, Leo, it'll be my reader version of what you live through.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   And I had another reaction to it.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   I'll talk about it in a second.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   But what strikes you is the serendipity of really smart people solving problems and creating amazing things out of that.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   That's where the essence of power is.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   Far more than the capital.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   Right.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   If somebody has a killer idea, there's plenty of capital.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   They'll go find capital.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.360]   Capital's not the limiter.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   Right.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   It's innovation and problem solving.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   Look, I guess I'm a post-state because I have for the last 30 years that technology is great.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   It's the way to go.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   It's going to change everything.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   It's going to fix everything.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   And I too, like Larry, have said, it's inevitable.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   So we've got to figure out what we do, not say stop it because you can't.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   So anyway, Matt-
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   It's not the place that levels advocate with you.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   No.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.360]   I appreciate it.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   I think monoculture is bad.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   Competition is good.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   We've got Microsoft.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   If you subscribe to Office 365, we'll give you unlimited storage.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   Amazon just announced unlimited photo storage.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   That's competition in the cloud space.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   That's great.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   I'm not seeing that.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   Yes.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   And as a search guy, I wish there were more search engines.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   Yahoo bought up a whole bunch and then Microsoft partnered with Yahoo.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   And so we had like seven or ten search engines in the early days.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   And we don't have the competition.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   There's plenty of vibrant competition, but I would love to see more.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   So I can absolutely channel where you're coming from on that.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   I think that's important as well.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   You're not going to see competition in search, though.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   That's the irony of this.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   I think you have now.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   There's no way anybody could compete at this point.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   You see things that are coming from a different angle, like Siri.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   Well, that's what's going to happen is that the kind of search and the kind of search
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:57.360]   Google does are, and I think this is what Larry really sees is, that cycle is ending.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   And now we have to think of what's next.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   And here's a series, an example, a social search, whatever it's going to be.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   It's changing.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.360]   Right?
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.360]   Yes.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   But we have to be mindful.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.360]   I think everybody at Google should be mindful of the impact of their actions.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   And I think about webmasters and if Google changes an algorithm, that can absolutely
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   have a large impact on a site publisher.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   And we try to think about that when we evaluate our algorithms.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   Good.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   Good.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   It's a hard thing to do.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   And as you get more power, even the slight, as you know, the slightest turn of the knob can make a huge impact.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   You've got the butterfly effect.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   Well, it's so nice to have you on here, Matt.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   I know we have to let you go.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   It's a great time to get back to that.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   I don't mean to get you into this discussion here.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   But you know, I love talking about Google and search and all this stuff.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   And I think it's really cool because while I was on official three months leave, you know, Jason Chad, nobody reached out.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   But I'm like, oh, I enjoy being on twig.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   So thanks for having me.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   We'll have you back more anytime you want.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   You could.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   This could be your new job.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   Yeah, we wanted to give you some space for sure.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.360]   And I shouldn't have brought this up.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   But I thought, you know, a, because everybody loves and trusts Matt cuts.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   So, and I know you're not a spokesman for Google, but I feel like having you there, reassures me.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:35.360]   And so I wanted to hear from you reassurance that, you know, the process is there.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   The collegiality, the consideration that don't be evil, all of that stuff is still there and still in effect.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   And that's what that's why we love talking to Matt.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   Because we trust you.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   So much.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   Sorry, I have to step off.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.360]   No, come back.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   Well, yeah.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   I promise.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   That's good.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.360]   Promise not to bring up Google next time you're here.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.360]   Cats.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.360]   Cats.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   Cat for us.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   Next week, cats and Halloween customs.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360]   Sounds good.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   Sounds good.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   Take care.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   Take care.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   Matt, be great.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   So actually we didn't put him on the spot as to when he'd be going back.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   2015 is all we've heard.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360]   Yes.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   That's when the Apple Watch will come out as well.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.360]   Uh, coincidence?
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.360]   I think not.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   I think not.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   Now Matt, that's one of the things that's great about Matt.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   Unlike, I think almost anybody, everybody at Google is great.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   Everybody ever talked to, and you talked to more people than I have, Jeff and Gina.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.840]   But everybody you talked to, even, you know, like Sundar Pachay, the conversation we had,
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:44.520]   and I'll never forget it about Chromebooks was so thoughtful, not defensive, well put.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.520]   Everybody I've met there is very impressive, very smart.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.360]   And I do trust them.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.960]   So here's another question, Leo.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.160]   Jenna, I'd really love to hear you answer this question, Gina.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.160]   Let's say that you weren't employed at Google.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.920]   Well, first question is, would you be an employee at Google?
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.440]   Let's just all say that we would work at Google.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   What would Google do that would make you quit?
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.040]   I'll give you one example.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:15.120]   I think that if we found out that Google had been willingly spying on citizens voluntarily
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.600]   for the government, that's the example.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.680]   We're not even for the government for their own benefit.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.840]   If you open a door to a conference room and they're on the screen, uh, our personal Skype
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:31.120]   conversations that were, or hangouts conversations that went over the Google network, and, uh,
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.760]   or ostensibly private, and I'm seeing them that I would leave.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.920]   Like, like the geeks and the good wife.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   Or maybe you wouldn't leave.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   Maybe you'd say maybe you'd be a whistleblower, but you, but that's it.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   Right.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.720]   I would think that I'd call this note in in that situation.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:53.320]   As, as, as a technologist, Gina, what's, there's got to be some description I think
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.720]   of companies you would work for, companies you wouldn't work for, and why.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.920]   I mean, I, I certainly have that in journalism.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   Uh, I, uh, can you express that in, in, in your world?
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.000]   Well, you know, for me, I'm just, I'm a bad employee.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I mean, this is just something I've learned about myself.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.520]   I, I want to do my own thing.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.520]   Me too.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.640]   I don't, I just, I'm just a bad employee.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.760]   Like, I, I, so I mean, even a company like Google where I feel like I would have, you
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.000]   know, I'd be able to do so much just dealing with like the politics and the meetings and
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   the layers of managers.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.360]   I mean, this, this would happen in any sort of big organization.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.840]   Like, just thinking about it makes me kind of tired.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.320]   And I just, I, I work well on my own and on small teams.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   I prefer small teams.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.520]   So that's just me personally.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.200]   Um, but yeah, I mean, you look for me to, you know, to, to choose a company to work
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.000]   for or work with, you know, it's, it would have to, it's a matter of like alignment with
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.760]   my values, right?
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.720]   Like, you know, is this company doing something or enough or something?
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.200]   You know, something I get to get behind, something that's making the world better.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.720]   Or is it put my talents to best use or the right people there?
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.160]   I mean, it's, you know, it's a whole, the whole list of things and Google certainly falls
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.760]   under those, those, you know, umbrellas.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.200]   But again, I, I, I like just my style.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.680]   I like to do something kind of small and in D and on my own, which arguably means I don't
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.000]   have as big an impact, which is something I definitely struggle with, you know, but I'm
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.360]   sure there's tons of projects at Google that never see the light of day either.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   But see that is kind of, I have that.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:19.600]   And that's the same thing that is driving me to distrust large companies in general.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.840]   I have a more kind of tribal communal notion of how things should happen.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.000]   And admittedly, you're never going to have a Google at that scale.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Right.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.360]   But I don't trust, I don't trust big companies.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.920]   And the bigger company gets, I think the less trustworthy it is.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:44.680]   So that's where I, I don't think it's an impossibility to have a big company you can
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   trust.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   There haven't been many examples.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.840]   There haven't no there.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.920]   It's not hard.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.920]   But it's not impossible.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   I always thought I was an optimist.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:59.600]   Jeff, you don't like when people automatically assume a company is evil based solely on its
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.080]   bottom line or size.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.080]   Right.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   Right.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   Give me the evidence.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.640]   I mean, and don't assume somebody is evil and awful just because they're in government.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.560]   And I often criticize government.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.640]   I think they're far more examples of people who act altruistically in government than
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.440]   there are people act altruistically in business.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.440]   Far more.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.640]   Most people, most people, I admit government corrupts and so forth.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.320]   But most, and there are lots of examples, counter examples, but most people who get
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.880]   into public service get into public service because they want to serve the public.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.200]   And go south from there.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.880]   And from there, it's all downhill.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.040]   Our show today, I'm not a cynic.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.040]   Is that weird?
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.480]   Maybe I should be living in Europe because I believe in government, but not in corporations.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.080]   Your best is extremely European.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:56.800]   Our show today brought to you by a very nice company.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.120]   Citrix Go To Meeting.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.640]   Everybody I know has used Go To Meeting.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.560]   I hope you've used Go To Meeting for a meeting.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560]   It's all we ever do.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.480]   We love Go To Meeting.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.000]   The people we work with, whether it's clients or vendors or coworkers, are almost always
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.760]   out of Petaluma.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.120]   So we have to be able to meet with them without having them in our studio and for us to travel
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.320]   to them is expensive and time consuming.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.520]   Sometimes we do phone conference calls.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.840]   I don't like them.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.160]   I like Go To Meeting.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.720]   Millions of professionals back me on this in business, large and small.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.080]   Go To Meeting is the best way to meet from the convenience of your computer, of your
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.680]   smartphone, of your tablet.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.920]   It's so great.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.400]   You pay once a month, hold as many meetings as you need with anyone, anywhere, and one
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.780]   virtual space.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.980]   You will share screens.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   That's great.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.220]   But you also could turn on the webcam so you see each other with high definition video
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   conferencing.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:53.640]   It allows you to engage and connect just like you're in the same room.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   I want you to try it.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   It's free right now.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.680]   If you visit Go To Meeting, click the Try It free button.

[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.920]   Try it and try it at your next meeting and let me know.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.440]   I think you will see that Go To Meeting is a remarkable way to get work done.

[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:24.080]   We thank Go To Meeting for their support of this week in Google.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.560]   This was a call to Vorac always made.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.560]   The Microsoft's got too big.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.840]   It needs to be split into three different companies.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.880]   But that was more because it was unmanageable at its size, not that it was dangerous.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.000]   Your opinions thought it was evil and taking over the world and it got too big for its
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   own good.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.160]   The real question for Google is, can it find the next thing?
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.960]   I mean, so far it's found the next thing.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.520]   It's in the phone business.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.480]   But none of them are businesses yet, right?
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:53.120]   I mean, they're in these businesses and clearly planning for the future, but really, how do
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.040]   they make their money?
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.280]   Here's the big question.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   Is advertising forever?
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   No.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   Because the whole isn't advertising company.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.880]   Not that kind of advertising, not display ads.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.840]   No.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.360]   Or I don't know.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.160]   But I think Larry is smart.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:10.600]   Larry Page is smart, not to assume that this business is going to continue this way forever.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.200]   And that's why they have so many projects from a purely business point of view.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   But Google could fail.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   Right.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   Cover all your bases.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   Right.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   See what works.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.120]   Do you think Matt will go back?
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   He was cagey.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.040]   Do you let him off the hook?
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   I let him off the hook.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.040]   Yeah, I didn't want to be mean.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.040]   Your wife.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.400]   Don't think he's made it.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.200]   I generally don't think he's made a decision yet.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.480]   But I do think it's a very good possibility that he won't go back.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   And I think that's okay.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.400]   If I were Google, I would say to Matt.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   I would say to Matt.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   What Matt would do outside of Google.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.400]   Is he a startup kind of guy?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.440]   I mean, Matt, he's been there 15 years.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   That's difficult.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.360]   Here we are speculating Matt without a new here.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   I know poor Matt.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   He's even one of the.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.200]   That's because I didn't want to have this conversation in front of him.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.160]   I don't want to put him on the spot.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.200]   But the question for me is if you're Google and you have a talent like Matt, and Matt is
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.400]   talented in so many ways, not just technologically, but also in trust is a talent of Matt.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   Oh, huge.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.000]   That is not even if he's just their spokesman.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   Whatever.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Yes.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Right.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.160]   Or an advisor.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.320]   So, you know, what I would hope for Google is I would hope that some top manager would
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.640]   go to Matt, take him out to lunch and say, challenge yourself.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   What do you want to do?
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   Right.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   And then how I guarantee you.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:28.640]   They're going to do that.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:35.840]   And Google has a well known history of writing very large checks saying, look, don't leave.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.040]   Here's $15 million, one million for every year.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.840]   Oh, man, I hope that happens for him.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.080]   Well, Gina, you who are unemployable.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.520]   Is there a number that somebody could write you a check and you would say, all right,
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:57.040]   I don't want to work for you, but I mean, look, you know, I would love to say that no one
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.080]   could afford me, but the truth is everyone has a price.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   Right.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   I mean, you know, right?
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   Like I'm not a wealthy person.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   I'm a working person.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   Right.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.720]   Would I love to have, you know, a few kind of money?
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.520]   Of course, like who wouldn't, you know, keep your purity.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.560]   It's a bad idea.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.240]   You want to be poor.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.000]   You want to have to work hard.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Trust me.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.640]   I'll let you know when I when I have this option and it's not just a thought exercise.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.800]   Did they put that thing on Ozzy's head or did you come here, bring Ozzy here.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.920]   Ozzy's come back from his groomers.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.480]   Did the groomer do that?
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.480]   Oh my God.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.480]   Oh my God.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   It looks like a baby.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   Oh, there.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   That's better.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.480]   That's better.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   That's better.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.160]   I turned into a babushka.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   Ozzy.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.960]   So I was sitting this morning.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:51.120]   Google has now said, if you go to drive.google.com, I'm sorry, play.google.com Google store and
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:57.280]   you click on devices, they say, come back every Wednesday because we'll have five more.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.480]   I don't know what.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.960]   We'll have more Nexus sixes for sale.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   And nothing.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   Well, no.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.960]   Oh, no.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.440]   You're going to get mad.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   I was mad.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.080]   So I sat there.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   I had read this.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.880]   It says we're getting more Nexus six devices in stock as soon as possible to make things
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.640]   simpler for you.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.880]   We will work to make more devices available each Wednesday and encourage you to visit
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   the site.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   It says Wednesday.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.720]   So this morning I got up at eight and did this the you know this Jason.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   The dance.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   The dance refresh.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   Isn't it?
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   Refresh.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   Refresh.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.160]   And it said we're out of inventory, whatever inventory.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.960]   And then I don't know why.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:43.040]   But all of a sudden on a black 32 gigabyte, it said ships in one to two weeks.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.520]   What cracks me up about this is not only is it difficult to get any, but once you get
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.560]   through on one configuration, it might not be the one you intended.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   It's so hard to get one.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   You get it anyways.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.560]   I did.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.560]   I don't want a 32 gig black.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.560]   I wanted a 64 gig.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.560]   What exactly?
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.960]   But I ordered it and guess what?
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.160]   Delivery November 21st.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.160]   Looking like that's just the time.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.360]   So just a tip.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   Nice.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   All right.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.760]   So they didn't really get me more in stock.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   I don't know what.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.000]   Jason ordered a week ago and you have the exact same delivery date.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Yep.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Scam.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.840]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.040]   They were looking in the cracks of the couch.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   And they, what do you know?
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   I found a couple of Nexus sixes down here.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.280]   I don't trust Google anymore.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.360]   Can't buy their phone.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   I don't trust them.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.600]   It did make me mad.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   So instead of because I thought I'm not going to get a Nexus six.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:39.040]   I don't, I do not want to add up how much I've spent on phones in the last two months.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.960]   Oh, man, Leo, your phone budget must be and the plans.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.960]   Oh, oh, I don't know.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.400]   But it's kind of, I feel like I kind of have to and you can get these devices sometimes
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.680]   from the carriers.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.320]   So they're not, you know, they're always carrier devices and, and for a week or two.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.480]   And you have to send it back.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.720]   So you really don't commit to it.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.800]   I don't feel like it's a good way to review it.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:12.240]   And yet I now have like you should see my desk littered iPhone six, six plus Moto X 2014.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.840]   Phone company every time to change the IMEI.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   One plus one.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   Well, I do a lot of when I can SIM card swapping.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.480]   Yeah, I know that.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.280]   But when you, when you change the SIM card in a new phone has a new IMEI.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.880]   No, you don't have to do that most of the time.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.920]   Like, so I got this is the Droid Turbo, which is a Moto X on steroids.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:35.120]   It actually looks a little swollen because they put a much bigger battery in here.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.320]   And my complaint on the 2014 Moto X was that it didn't get through the day.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.920]   It got about 12 hours battery life.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.040]   Some hope it was only resin phone.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.640]   Well, yeah, which is a bummer because it's a droid.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:52.200]   Although the rumor is they'll be selling it as the Droid Maxx internationally and it
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.600]   is identical to a Moto X.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.600]   What's the good?
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.200]   Here's the good news in terms of software, you know, all of the Moto X feet, almost all
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.520]   the Moto X features made it over to the Droid Turbo except for.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.760]   And I don't know how important this is.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.320]   Miriam Jwar was talking about this yesterday.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:12.280]   It doesn't have the aluminum band with the carefully tuned antenna thing where, you know,
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.480]   it's a two antenna and it only has one antenna.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.440]   So you can't talk and date at the same time.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.440]   That's also a disadvantage.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.920]   I don't care about that.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.360]   I mean, it's bummer to some.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:29.880]   But it has a 21 megapixel camera, which doesn't look any better.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.320]   I haven't really done a full testing, but it's like pixels don't matter.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.720]   I don't think they matter.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.640]   It's the same camera, same Moto X camera thing.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.920]   I have some pictures.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.280]   I don't know.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:51.360]   You know, in good light, if you hold it really carefully steady, it looks pretty good.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.200]   The pictures I took at you guys didn't.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:58.360]   Well, we don't we don't we don't we don't take very good pictures just to be.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.560]   And it was a front facing selfie, right?
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.160]   This is a good this is a good example in daylight.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:10.880]   It is obviously high res 6.2 megabytes as a JPEG 5248 by 2952.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.640]   The detail in the Christmas is quite good.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:18.480]   And of course, Google enhanced it quote.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.560]   This is this is low light and.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.160]   Oh, fuzzy there.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.480]   You can see that grain, can't you?
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.800]   This is F2 ISO 1600 115th of a second exposure.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.160]   So it did the best it could.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.960]   This was at night.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   That's not a great picture.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.960]   Yeah, a little little fuzzy.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.960]   But that's a selfie, remember?
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.520]   So that's the front facing camera, right?
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.680]   So it's not quite as good.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.360]   In fact, that's only a megabyte.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.360]   It's in size.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.440]   But you know, you can blame us a little bit for breaking the sensor in the camera.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.880]   19 20 by 1080.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.880]   That's just bad.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   There you go.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   This is from the front.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   That looks pretty good.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.880]   That's a pretty good picture.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   Color colors excellent.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.960]   There you are, Gina.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.880]   This is of all about Android last night.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.600]   I think it's a good camera.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.160]   I still think the Note 4 is a better camera.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.040]   Unfortunately, you have to use the Samsung stuff, which is not.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.840]   You know, I've been looking at the Galaxy 2 camera, Galaxy Camera 2.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.000]   It's the Android camera.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   All right.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.720]   You know, and I'm actually kind of a little bit tempted by it.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.280]   The software on it for changing settings and aperture, all that is actually kind of neat.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.760]   I'm surprised Samsung hasn't brought it into more of what they do.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   But is it not?
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.560]   It's like jelly bean or something, isn't it?
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   It's pretty old.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   But it'd be your own.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.040]   You're not using it as anything other than camera.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.000]   Well and the main reason I wanted to get this Nexus 6.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.400]   Yes, you see, it's a camera with an Android phone on it in the back.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.400]   Built in.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   That's so neat.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   I thought it was going to be so cool.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   It was so awesome.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   Oh, weird.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.680]   Well, it'd be a good camera, I guess.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.240]   You know, if you really want a camera, get a camera.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.440]   Don't worry about the Android.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.880]   Just get a good camera.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.120]   They're good cameras out there.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.080]   The reason I wanted the Nexus 6 is I wanted a lollipop.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Now I have a Nexus 7.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.040]   I suppose some people bought a Nexus 9, the new tablet, to get a lollipop.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.200]   Are the Nexus 9s arriving?
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   They are.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   So some people...
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   Lollipop is out.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.560]   Mine was supposed to get here yesterday.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   I'm not arriving.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.520]   I'm not waiting for it today.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.200]   You know, hard not life.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.880]   It's a hard not life.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.920]   Yeah, we're complaining about having too many things.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.640]   And getting them a day late.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   Oh, shut up.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.800]   You're going to have to wait till tomorrow?
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.840]   It's a hard not life.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.480]   I'm not sure you have one, but it was a review unit, I think.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.760]   Yeah, I think a few units have gone out of both the Nexus 6 and 9.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   And the player.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.080]   But the rumor is, and I don't think Google has said, we were hoping to get updates on
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:46.080]   the Nexus devices like the 5 and the 7 and the 10 to lollipop like yesterday.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.480]   And the rumor is it will be now a week from today, November 12th, due to bugginess in lollipop.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.960]   Oh, maybe.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   Oh.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   Don't know.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:03.000]   So, you're going to have to wait.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   I want to see.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.040]   By the way, we're important people.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.920]   And one argument for a Motorola phone, even though now this has been, it's now Lenovo,
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:15.200]   but is that Motorola has promised that the X is in the turbo and all this will be up
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.360]   to end will be updated to lollipop as soon as they can.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:23.600]   Now did not, Gina did not, did they not release the source code in the AOSP on Monday?
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   They did.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.400]   It's out to AOSP, which is great news for everybody.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   What does that mean?
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.280]   Tell us what, tell us why that's great news.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.000]   It means that anyone who does any sort of mods can get, can, can start rebasing their
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.200]   work on top of, on top of AOSP.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.600]   So like, say, antigen mod or, you know, all the big manufacturers can start porting their
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:46.280]   skins and doodads and apps over to lollipop, making sure that it works, you know, custom
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:51.040]   ROMs, all that stuff developers can hop on, get, get that code and start working on it.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.920]   So it just means that we're going to, and it means that, you know, on the OnePlus one,
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.920]   we're going to get lollipop.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.000]   I think they said 90 days.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.160]   Oh, well, that takes a while.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.720]   90 days from the latest from the AOSP drop.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.960]   So 90 days from Monday.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   Right.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.840]   So that's because it's a cyanogen mod, a CM 11.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.640]   And so cyanogen gets the source code like they're working on it right now.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.640]   Right.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.640]   But they have to modify it.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.880]   And it's a pretty heavily modified.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   Isn't it?
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.880]   Big difference.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   I still like the OnePlus.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.200]   I think the OnePlus in many respects is the phone to get, especially for the prices the
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   fund again.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.200]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:33.160]   Some interesting similarities right now between the OnePlus approach to selling their device
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:39.400]   and the skit and the same type of scarcity slash contest for the Nexus six right now.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.600]   It's almost like they're playing from the same playbook.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.400]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.720]   Did you, Jeff, you did.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.560]   You went to the site and you were refreshing it.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   You did that, didn't you?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.360]   Well, it was all morning.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.120]   I just feel like I should put ads on there just to make,
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.000]   more revenue on people refreshing that are on pay.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.160]   I feel like I want to be lottery.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   Let me ask you this.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:03.320]   The Apple Apple stores I work by was at the Cube on Fifth Avenue today.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.280]   And my mall, there's lines out of the mall.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.840]   Is this, is this ongoing demand for the phone?
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840]   Yes.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840]   Yes.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.680]   We were talking about this on Sunday that there are still lines at Apple stores to get
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   the iPhone.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.960]   That because it's slow to do the process is that because they did have the phones.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.760]   What's causing that kind of scarcity behavior?
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:28.400]   I don't know in this case, but generally it's because each store gets a shipment of 100
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400]   in the morning.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:35.120]   So people line up so they can get those phones.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.680]   One plus says according to our chat room, when Scissor says one plus says they've sold
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.680]   half a million units.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680]   I haven't read that.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.680]   That's pretty good.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:51.480]   Given the scarcity and how hard it is to get one, half a million phones sold to date according
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.400]   to Lily Putin.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.920]   So I thought my one plus was busted last night.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.320]   This was a typical Jeff story.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.800]   So night before last, I'm driving home and every time I'm trying to call the Italian
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.880]   restaurant to order some chicken parm on the way home, it's my sand life and one ring
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.040]   terminates, two rings, terminates, one ring terminates.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.000]   The guy would come on and start to say hello, I say, ah, ah, I'm coming.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   So I thought it was his phone.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Right.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.920]   So poor guy, I'm calling like 25 times.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.280]   He's sitting there saying, who's this schmuck calling me every 30 seconds.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.040]   And so that I'll try another number.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040]   Same thing.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.960]   Oh, oh.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.680]   So I get home and I pull up the Nexus five and I put the sim in there and I say, okay,
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.320]   this is that I'm sick with the Nexus five works like twice and then same thing terminate
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   terminator.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.920]   So it's your carrier.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   It's the carrier's AT&T.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.960]   There's a very nice woman behind AT&T care is named Jory who's trying to help me.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.480]   I still don't have help.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.800]   Everybody else, another AT&T executive was nice enough to put it in escalation.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.600]   Is it always the same locale?
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.360]   It's across 40 miles of New Jersey as well as Manhattan.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   Must be something bad.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.200]   They thought they were doing an upgrade to something in another order.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.960]   So we've figured out yet the point is, but I was ready to throw the one bus one out the
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.320]   window and pull a Jeff rant and thank goodness I didn't because it was not the one plus
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   one.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   Ah.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.560]   So this comes from a UN Spence in Forbes.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:25.040]   He was at the Dublin Web Summit talk to a one plus founder and director Carl Pay.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.080]   And Carl said that they have passed half a million handsets.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:34.200]   There's a push to reach a stretch goal, but of one million before the end of the year.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.000]   It's going to be hard said pay, but I think it's possible.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.280]   The advertising budget, $300.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.280]   Wow.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.280]   Well, that's not million, not billion, hundred.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.360]   All of that money was spent experimenting on different types of Facebook ads.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   Social media.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   Oh, interesting.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   We found that we've now reached a critical massive users and we don't have to buy anymore
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   ads.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.280]   Is that a typo?
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280]   $300.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.280]   Right.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.920]   So the price was the marketing.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   Well, yeah.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   And you know what?
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   It worked.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.880]   And I think everybody who has the phone, which includes you and Gina and Father Robert has
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.560]   my one plus and Jason has a one plus.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   We all agree.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.520]   It's really for the $350.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.560]   That is a heck of a great phone.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560]   It really is.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.880]   Good camera, shoots camera raw, signage and mod is really a nice version of Android.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:35.560]   I mean, the $300 marketing budget would account for the stupid contest.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560]   Exactly.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.720]   How many times in all about Android have we discussed about how the marketing team was
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.920]   practically asleep when they're planning these things?
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.400]   Apparently, it's because the marketing team doesn't actually exist.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.120]   They were clearly high school student interns.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120]   Right.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120]   That's fine though.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120]   It worked.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.480]   And I think this is nice.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.560]   It shows that you could do something.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.000]   There's a lot of companies be very happy with sales of a half a million through $300.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.800]   Especially for an upstart.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   Well, right.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   Reportedly, right?
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   Yeah, right.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   Right.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.720]   I had a jar of this in moments.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.200]   A friend of mine called me and said that someone else picked up.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.760]   She asked, "Who is this?
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.960]   Did you just get your number?"
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.280]   And this person said, "Yeah, I just got this number."
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.600]   And so my friend said, "Yeah, did your number change?"
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.680]   And I said, "No, that's a little weird."
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.040]   And then I realized I went to my Google Voice settings.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.320]   It was my Google Voice number and realized there were two phones that I no longer have,
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.280]   which I had forgotten to turn it off to stop ringing.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:39.240]   So I've been ringing two stranger's phones, all my calls for a while.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.360]   So I wondered, Leo, you, you, you, you, you, SimSwap, how do you keep track of all the
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   phones?
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   Because he's, he's good voice.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360]   I still use Google Voice.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.360]   So you can only have five phones.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.440]   So you are like, you are edge case.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.000]   You are pushing the limits of this.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.920]   I have at all times five phones on my Google Voice number, but I, I spend probably, I go
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.840]   in there at least several times a week to update.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.840]   Like deactivate one and turn on another.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840]   Wow.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.680]   But even, you know what's great is even Verizon now, you, you can put the SIM card on this
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.680]   one is so weird.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.120]   You actually have to pull out the volume rocker.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.520]   You can use a little drawer underneath the volume rocker and you just pull it out.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.720]   And I, and you just swap the SIM card even with Verizon.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.120]   Now I don't, I don't do sprint for that reason because CDMA, you have to call and all that
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.120]   stuff.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.120]   So it's a T&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   It's just, it's a musical SIM cards.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.320]   And it's not carrier locked.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.360]   You don't have to, it's just, it's just, I haven't yet tried that with this phone, but
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.760]   I was able to put a T-Mobile and AT&T SIM into my Verizon iPhone.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.960]   And I think somebody told me, people have told me in Twitter and so forth that that's
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.200]   because they have a consent degree with FCC.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   That's so.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.720]   Well, this goes back to the Nexus, the don't get me started.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.480]   This is all back to the Nexus 7.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:59.640]   If you use the LTE, using the LTE spectrum, they bought the condition, that spectrum as
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.040]   required by Google when it was in that auction.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040]   Is it open?
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.280]   It is openness to devices.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   Yep.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:13.000]   So Verizon's actually against their will, a really good choice.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.120]   So you could, now I don't, don't quote me yet.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.760]   I, I, I will go home and put a T-Mobile SIM in this and an AT&T and SIM in this case.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.480]   I'm gonna, it's a nano SIM.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.000]   I'm gonna work.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.840]   You don't think it'll work?
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.480]   I already swapped SIMs with another, with the iPhone and changed the phone number.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.200]   But that was, I thought it was through that whole new SIM thing and all that stuff, right?
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.760]   Yeah, but not on the iPhone, just on the iPad.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760]   Ah.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:40.280]   So this is a CDMA phone, but because everything's LTE now, they use some for LTE.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.480]   I don't know, what does it fail down?
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.200]   It fails down to a CDMA?
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.080]   I don't know what it fails down to.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.200]   I don't know.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   It fails down.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.160]   Yeah, I guess at some point it would go to, what is it?
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.120]   One RTT?
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.120]   I think that's a CDMA technology.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.280]   You'd have to fail down pretty good though.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:02.680]   Anyway, that's a phone talk.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.840]   We really should sit reserved that for all about Android.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.840]   Sorry, you've already yelled at us on, on, on Twitter last week.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.040]   It's supposed to be about Google, not about phones.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.920]   Well, Android is Google gosh, is it getting darned?
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Yeah, it is.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   Mm-hmm.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.440]   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.920]   Google has leased a New York cookie factory in Chelsea.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.280]   More space for this company that's growing too big.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   Hurdio.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.920]   They need more space.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:37.520]   Really, you don't, you have no fears of Google becoming kind of the Borg.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.520]   The Borg?
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:42.800]   Um, I think that, I mean, listen, I'm not, I'm not over trying the Borg.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   I'm about to sound like one.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.560]   I think the market will take care of them if they do.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.480]   Yeah, that was kind of what Matt was saying was, as long as there's competition, you don't
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.040]   have to worry, but there isn't Google is not, goes of an opt, like, come on.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.540]   Right?
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:59.200]   Not in search, not on the, you know, it is an advertising.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.080]   Yeah, well, that's where all the money comes from.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.080]   They signed a lease for 180,000 square foot Nabisco cookie factory right next to the
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.600]   high line.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.760]   So you'll be able to try to think of a cookie joke and I couldn't come up with one.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760]   Nabisco.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.400]   Nabisco had to move to New Jersey.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.400]   So Google's moving in.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.640]   Yeah, that's the economy right there in that shell.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.240]   Move over to Nabisco.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.880]   Move over here.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   Here comes Google.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.400]   Um, I visited the New York office once and they're, they're definitely busted out of this,
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.800]   you know, it's busted at the seams.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.840]   They've been looking for space in New York, I think, for, for a while.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   Okay.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   This is nearby.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.240]   So they have the Chelsea, they have the big old port.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.040]   If you haven't been to New York and seen this, the Port Authority building is a complete
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   city block and you just don't see that.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   It's just gigantic.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.640]   That's where they put all the bums, right?
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.640]   That's where Google is.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.640]   Plus a couple of other companies.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.200]   No, no, no, not that, not the bus thing.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.960]   Not the Port Authority bus terminal.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.800]   The old Port Authority office then.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   Okay.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.600]   And across from that is the Chelsea market, which they also took over much of that.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.040]   And tomorrow night I'm going to the opening of the, the YouTube New York studio there.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   Ooh.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.160]   And then nearby is the cookie factory.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   Is this a new studio?
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.160]   It smells really good in the Google offices.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.880]   It smells like Nilla Vanilla Wafers.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.160]   Too late for gingerbread.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.360]   There we are.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:29.440]   There's the cookie joke.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.800]   Is the YouTube facility in New York new?
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800]   Yes, it's new.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.360]   They have one of them.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.360]   The studio was LA.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   And they're open to one in New York.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   I'm surprised.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.080]   I thought that was a, to me in my mind, that was a failed initiative.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.080]   A lot of money.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.440]   It's the same thing when Google spent $100 million to get big brand names to make YouTube
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   videos for nothing.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440]   Just kidding, stole.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.400]   She's a new sheriff in town trying to figure out in a new way.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.880]   So I presume she approved this.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.440]   I mean, what, what benefit has accrued to Google from the LA studio?
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   Besides goodwill with, which is probably a real benefit, but goodwill with the YouTube
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   video folks.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.880]   I mean, I don't see suddenly, you know, the hot videos on YouTube aren't suddenly great
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   production value.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.760]   No, you're, and, and, and, and away.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.760]   I don't want YouTube videos to come.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.760]   No.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.760]   Much value.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.240]   I want them to be fresh and weird and different.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.240]   It's a video of the people.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.640]   I just, I'm so, but they'll have swags will go.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   Right.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.880]   And now she's apparently considering Susan Wojiski's considering some sort of subscription
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.080]   model, but they already have a subscription model.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.080]   This is something she's talking about.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.080]   Recode mobile.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.440]   I'm where you couldn't get rid of the ads.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.720]   Oh, and add free YouTube.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.720]   She made some reference in there to, to, to, maybe what if you don't want the ads?
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   I don't want the ads.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.360]   I'll pay for an ad for YouTube.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.120]   Yeah, I would too.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.440]   Cause, cause we had a story, I think last week that the amount of money that YouTube
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.400]   has, I forget, it's, you know, a billion dollars, whatever.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.680]   Some ridiculous amount of money that they have now sent to copyright holders.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   Right.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.600]   Rather than demanding to take their stuff down and say, okay, leave it up and just share
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.000]   the ad revenue with us.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.400]   They distributed a lot of money.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.400]   Right.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:14.840]   So is there a, is there a music streaming ad free music streaming model for video now where
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.440]   they can just put the revenue with copyright holders?
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.600]   How much would it have to cost though?
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.920]   I can't imagine that YouTube makes more than five bucks, 10 bucks a month on me.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.760]   But you know, I was, I was just at this conference where it's all off the records.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:32.160]   I don't really talk about it, but, but, but, uh, uh, the heads of the guy who's responsible
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.880]   for breaking bad and all the shows we like from, uh, from AMC and Peter churn and, and,
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:44.920]   uh, executive from AMC, we're all up there and I won't quote them by name, but the discussion
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.920]   was, what is they called?
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.400]   L, um, uh, L VOD, I think it's called, uh, or SVOD, SVOD.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.880]   Um, all these services are there more Netflix to come and what's obvious.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.160]   SVOD is subscription video on demand.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.160]   Thank you.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.120]   And there's either huge things like Netflix or Amazon or there's tiny things like, uh,
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.560]   was a crunch roll anime.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.080]   Um, and in both can succeed.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.600]   And so I think there would be a lot of, of, of, of opportunities for over the top.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   Now of course the end of what the industry is buzzing about is what HBO and CBS said.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.160]   They were going to leave, right, you know, they were going to offer over the top subscriptions
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   to their content.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.240]   You didn't have to have a cable subscription.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.200]   And we'll see how that works and we'll see if that works and how many subscriptions people
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.480]   are willing to do.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.400]   And can you succeed without, uh, having an operation?
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:46.440]   But, but, but if, if Fred Ralston wrote a piece about podcasts this last week, uh, inspired
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.280]   by New York magazine cover on it and he put the last paragraph, he put in there, the
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.680]   thing that I've been arguing for years is that Howard Stern should go to the internet
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:13:00.600]   and go to YouTube, which is where I, I, I introduced them to Google five years ago.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.200]   And I would pay every month for that.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.000]   I would pay every month for the CBS thing because I could, if I could immediately get
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.380]   good wife, which I'm now addicted to, um, a little higher scale than your Kardashian
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.380]   addiction, Gina.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.840]   Oh, good wife is awesome.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   I love the good wife.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840]   Isn't it great?
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   One of my favorite shows.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.800]   Oh, I've been bit.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.800]   Um, I would pay for HBO on my own.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.160]   So I, I think there could be things that you would pay for.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:32.520]   The question is, is it, is it an omnibus, um, YouTube subscription like prime or is it
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.520]   sets of subscriptions?
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.080]   I have no idea what they plan, but I think there's something interesting there.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.800]   It cracks me up that, uh, mainstream media has discovered podcasts and says we're in
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.800]   a renaissance.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   What?
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800]   Wait, what?
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:53.480]   I think it was a Washington Post wrote that article like three weeks ago and that, uh,
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.720]   New York magazine, Kevin was just wrote the same one.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.920]   Have you listened to Alex Bloomberg's?
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.000]   Uh, by the way, that's why this happened because Alex Bloomberg was a producer at this American
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.600]   life, which all of the media elite listened to.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.840]   It exactly did a podcast about starting a podcast, which is the kind of thing that happened
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.840]   when podcasting started.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.920]   We were all talking about podcasting all the time.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.800]   Welcome, you know, to the 21st century Alex.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.680]   Um, but apparently because everybody listens to that, they suddenly said, Oh, podcasts are
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.680]   back being money.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.720]   By the way, Alex only makes money because he had a Kickstarter, right?
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:28.840]   I mean, he's not making any money on it.
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.120]   Well, he has ads on it.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.760]   He has a Mailchimp on it.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.960]   Uh, we have Mailchimp.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.360]   I mean, the reason I really like the podcast is because it's exactly what all my students
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.000]   go through starting a company.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.200]   They think this, they learn that.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.360]   They think this, they learn that.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.520]   And it's what Alex is going through.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.520]   Very transparent.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.480]   I'm just, I'm so glad to hear there's a renaissance and that finally we can make some on this
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   bitter.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.480]   Oh, oh.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.480]   Here's the good news.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480]   Get off my life, people.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.080]   They're being all these articles and none of them.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.840]   Nobody ever asked me because what I, did I tell them, what do you tell them?
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   I'm going to tell my renaissance.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.480]   We've been growing a steady clip since 2005.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   What are you talking about?
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   I don't think people think your podcast will be legal.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480]   Well, they're wrong.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   I mean, I'm not.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.480]   I don't use the word podcast, but what are they talking about?
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.320]   If they're not talking about what I do.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.520]   Um, there will be a piece on us, uh, marketplace tomorrow, I'm told.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.880]   Oh, NPR is doing a piece on the podcast renaissance.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.120]   And I think they're going to quote me because the reporter, uh, John Kalish interviewed
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.120]   me.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.240]   So I hope they have a piece of me saying, what are you talking about?
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.280]   You have a little bit of experience here.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.880]   I think maybe you are a good person to talk to.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.520]   A little bit about it.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.000]   You know, a little bit about it.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.640]   Now this has always been the problem kind of with what we do.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   And I, we're here.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   We're going to get self-wrench, or preferential.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.800]   So I won't do it for too long, but just for a second.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.200]   But, uh, what is this that we do?
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   What is this that we do?
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.200]   I don't know.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.200]   It's just, uh, I don't know what we, I don't know.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.200]   It shows.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.920]   It's an internet shows, which is what I've always said.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.240]   I said, don't call it podcasts because that implies it's on a pod.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.200]   It's a dumb name and that's not what we do.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.560]   I mean, where some of us, some people are watching live.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   That's like TV.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.960]   Some people listen in their car.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.240]   That's like a podcast, but it's not the only thing we did.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.040]   They're, they're talking right now to us and that's like nothing.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   We've seen before.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   It's true.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:16.040]   I mean, I'm explaining, I say like I do a show and people will say you do a show.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   And it's like, yeah, it's a show.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.280]   I mean, it's called the web.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   It's video.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.120]   It's live, but also recorded.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.560]   I mean, it's hard to explain, right?
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.640]   People get the idea of a podcast where it's like, you know, a few friends are hanging out
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.200]   or skyping and record it, right?
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.600]   And then put it, but this is more than much more than that, but it has that component.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.080]   And you never use the word podcast, which I think maybe makes you, you make two sort
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.120]   of defy categorization, Leo, which is maybe why you're not like the go to person for
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.120]   these conversations.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.120]   Right.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.560]   Well, I don't care if they quote me, but it's just, uh, it is ironic that they think that
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560]   some sort of renaissance.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.440]   I think you're reinventing TV.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   Well, I don't know.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.960]   I still say this is television.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.880]   Yeah, it's more like TV than a podcast, whatever.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:03.320]   Our show today brought to you by, I don't, I mean, no, I like the stuff.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.560]   It just cracks me up.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.920]   It's like, what do you mean?
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   It's just there.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.040]   Oh, now because somebody from the media establishment is doing a podcast, it must be
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   a renaissance.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.680]   That's what actually that's what bothers me is that it does whatever it is that we do
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.720]   has no credibility unless it comes from the media establishment.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.000]   And then, oh, no, it's serious.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.240]   But go tell that to Mark Merren.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.720]   Go tell that to Adam Corolla.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720]   Go tell that.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.960]   There's so many people been doing this, whatever it's called successfully for 10 years.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.760]   Oh my, we're going to celebrate our 10th anniversary next year in April.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.000]   That's amazing.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.480]   But there's a renaissance.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.880]   It's TV with buffering.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   Thank you, Keith.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.040]   You still haven't asked the question.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.080]   Have you listened to Alex's?
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.720]   No, I should listen to it, I guess.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:02.280]   I don't listen to a lot of podcasts because I like my audio books.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.280]   But I listened to a few.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.920]   I listen to this American life is a great is one of the great radio shows of all time.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.680]   It's not a podcast.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.920]   And it's just a radio show that they also offer online.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.920]   Right.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.080]   They distribute as such.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.760]   They distribute as a podcast.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.160]   Anyway, I don't know what it is.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.800]   Kevin Smith, there's another one's been doing this for a long time.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.880]   Our show today brought to you by, but this is what's exciting about the Internet.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.760]   It's reinventing kind of traditional businesses and prosper is a good example.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.160]   They're reinventing the loan, the bank loan.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.120]   You don't have to go into a bank to get a loan from prosper.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.640]   It's a marketplace.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.920]   It brings together people who have money to lend with people who have want to borrow
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920]   money.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.280]   And it's very successful.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.440]   They have now more than a billion dollars in loans funded, 2 million members, lenders
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   and borrowers alike.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.800]   I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.440]   The other thing is it's friction free.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.760]   I mean, I mean, that's what's great about the Internet.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.760]   Imagine, well, that ever walking into a bank, if you could have in the next three days 35
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.200]   grand to cover your needs, what would you do?
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.080]   Would you pay off high rate credit cards or maybe do a little home and pre-pay?
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.520]   Improvement, build a podcast network.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.880]   All you got to do is fill out an easy online application.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.920]   Just like you see it on the screen, if you're watching a video, you, this will not affect
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.160]   your credit score.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:24.240]   Very minimal amount of personal information and you will get your rate almost instantly
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.720]   online.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.520]   Prosper offers low fixed rates.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.880]   These are unsecured personal loans.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:29.880]   So there's no collateral.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.240]   They do have multi-year terms.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.680]   It really is an awesome way to borrow money.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.680]   No outrageous fees.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.000]   No rising interest rates.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.440]   And no bank, prosper.com/twit.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.240]   That's what you need to know.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.880]   You don't even put on your pants.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.360]   Prosper is offering Twit viewers for a limited time a $50 Visa prepaid card.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.040]   When you get a loan, go to the website, prosper.com/twit.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:58.640]   Get that loan and the $50 Visa prepaid card right now.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.240]   Internet does see that in some ways I feel guilty because we do look a little kind of
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.240]   like old media.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.400]   In fact, our model is very old media-like.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.440]   So maybe what Twit does is not really significant.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.320]   It's just the only thing different is it's...
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.240]   Oh, no, no, no, it's very significant.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240]   It's just...
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240]   Oh, thank you.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.080]   I kind of was fishing for that one.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.720]   We wouldn't be here if it wasn't me.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.720]   It's significant in a couple of ways.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.240]   Internet distribution of television is what supposedly was going to happen 10 years ago
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   on that day.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.240]   It's not just...
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.080]   It's not that you've also read it as the form.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.720]   And you've read it out of the relationship with the audience.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.480]   This is kind of like the McLaughlin group, but...
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:44.720]   McLaughlin wouldn't have tolerated the chat room.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.800]   No, I would like to see that.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.960]   You raging idiots!
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   Your fools!
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   Wrong!
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   You're wrong!
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.480]   All of you are wrong!
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   Let's do the Google change-long challenge.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.360]   The Google change-long!
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.280]   Gina Trapani has the latest from Google.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.240]   Well, the good news about Lollipop dropping soon is that we're seeing overhauls of all
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.480]   of Google's proprietary, all their Google apps for Android.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.240]   We've got three of them today.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.440]   Maps, Gmail, and Calendar.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.680]   I'll get them the material design Lollipop love.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.920]   So Google Maps update is rolling out now, new material design layouts, focusing on bright
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.120]   colors and real-world surfaces and shadows.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.040]   They added a couple of new features to dinner reservations from OpenTable.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.200]   You can make write-in maps.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.200]   That's US-only.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:46.520]   And better looking information cards with photos and reviews of popular attractions near your
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.520]   location.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.800]   And actually, sorry, this is set to roll out over the next few days.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.760]   Google Maps also has support for Uber pickup times and fares.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.440]   Only if you have the Uber app installed.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   Gmail.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.840]   Gmail's material design upgrade is also rolling out.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.840]   I've been waiting.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.840]   I haven't sideloaded this yet.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.160]   You can sideload the APK.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.120]   The production signed Google version is out.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.560]   You can find that at Android Police.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.440]   It should be going out over the air, through the Play Store soon.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:19.400]   It's the material design makeover of Gmail with Exchange and Pop and iMap support so you
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:23.360]   can get all your email in the native Gmail app.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.240]   And from what I hear, it's very, very similar to inbox.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:34.920]   Google Calendar is also getting the big material design overhaul with a few new features.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.120]   It's getting events from Gmail.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:40.440]   So now email, you can turn emails into calendar events automatically.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.720]   So if you get an invitation to something, that'll show up right on your calendar.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.200]   I think they're calling in Google Calendar Assist.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.000]   These are suggestions that save you time.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.480]   So calendar can suggest titles, peoples, and places as you type.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:01.000]   So if you often say go running with a friend, a friend named Jason in Central Park, calendar
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.400]   will suggest that entire event to you if you just type "run."
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.880]   So it learns as you use it.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.360]   And then you've got this new schedule view that's very in line with the material design
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.960]   focus of big images.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.160]   It includes photos and maps of places you're going at cityscapes and illustrations of everyday
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.960]   events, like coffee, yoga, that kind of thing.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:23.560]   The new calendar is available right now on all devices running Lollipop.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:28.880]   And the update will be able to download it, other devices from Google Play in the coming
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   weeks.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.920]   And this update is actually also going to go out to iOS.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.840]   So those are the three big Lollipop/material design updates.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.480]   A couple other new things.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:46.840]   Google Drive now lets you open files in compatible Mac and PC apps with a new Chrome extension.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.960]   So this new Chrome extension is called Application Launcher for Drive.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.200]   You can search that in the Chrome Web Store.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.640]   And it allows users to open files directly from its Google Drive service in compatible
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.920]   apps on a Mac PC.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.480]   So basically, the extension adds an open with option that will let you launch a file so
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:10.680]   that you're looking at and drive in apps like OS 10's preview app or third party editing
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.560]   apps like Adobe or Microsoft.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.080]   So yeah, you can see that in there.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   What's that?
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.880]   So Jane stopped this crazy thing.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.600]   So it's just met marrying the cloud and the desktop.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.640]   Yeah, we had a looping enemy to gift there.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.880]   I'm just playing how that works.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:31.880]   Let's see, what else?
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:37.720]   Oh, I haven't used a Roku in a while, but the Roku just got a new Google Play movies
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.720]   and TV app.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.720]   So awesome.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.720]   Yeah, pretty, pretty cool.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.840]   I think this is the first time we're seeing Google Play movies and TV somewhere other than
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.840]   on Android, right?
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:46.840]   I think so, yeah.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.880]   Yeah, making it stay be in the Roku channel store, Google Play movies and TV, of course,
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.120]   which is the app that lets you buy and rent videos.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.280]   Pretty standard, you know, video focused application.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.880]   The one feature that Play TV and movies has, which is pretty cool, is that those info cards
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.680]   related to content that you're watching.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:13.280]   So if you press pause on an actor and a scene, you can see who it is and get information about
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   that person.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.800]   Really, really neat feature.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.800]   So you'll get that on Roku as well.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:25.560]   Finally, Google has quietly launched the star's interface for Google Bookmark.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.000]   So we've seen a couple of rumors about this, which I think we talked about a couple of times,
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.640]   some screenshots leaked of this new bookmarking feature called stars.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.760]   Well, that's gone live.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.400]   Google didn't really make a big deal or announcement about it, but it's in the Chrome Web Store
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.400]   now.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.200]   It's called the Chrome Bookmark Manager.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:49.480]   And the next report that this new extension completely replaces Chrome's old bookmarks
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.240]   interface.
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.440]   And the idea of stars is to make saving bookmarks really easy, organizing them very quickly
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.600]   and automatically.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.480]   You know, it's more enough actually to go through all of your bookmarks and organize
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.480]   them into automatically generated categories based on what you've gotten there.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:11.920]   So if you, one of those people who just collects bookmarks and I have been that person over
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.080]   the years, that sounds like this is worth taking a look at.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.600]   And that's the Chrome Bookmark Manager and the Chrome Web Store.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.360]   I can search for it.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.840]   Well, I installed it.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.840]   And look at it.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   Let me see.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.600]   Let's see if the check crunch article has the direct link.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.240]   And let me make sure that it's just called bookmark manager.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.440]   Am I my thing?
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:42.960]   Here it is, it says bookmark manager from Google.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.240]   It's a, yeah, this is it.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   Search tools, huh?
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240]   It's not an extension.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.240]   It's an extension.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.080]   So it's in the Chrome Web Store.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.080]   I still don't see it.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.760]   It's so amazing when they have a new Android app or a new extension and you search for it
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.040]   in the store and it doesn't come up.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.280]   It sometimes takes time for the show up in search results, which is so, so ironic.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280]   It's kind of Pinterest-y.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.280]   Pinterest-y.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.280]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280]   Your bookmarks.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   I like it.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.320]   Yeah, I haven't had a whole, I haven't had a whole lot of time with it myself, but yeah,
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320]   you like it?
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.560]   It's now, I haven't done it on this machine.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.480]   So you can see it's churning on my bookmarks.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.840]   It's going to make a, it's going to reorganize them for me.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.920]   Churn, churn, churn, churn.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.680]   It's not a C here.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.680]   Just a dot.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.680]   Just a dot.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.680]   Just a dot.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.680]   Plus your chatroom.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   Thank you very much.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   Chatroom solves by the link.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:47.280]   Oh, it's G-M-L-L-L-B-G-H-N-F-K-P-F-E-L-E-M-I-H-A-J-A-K-B-A-P-O-J-O-P-F-J-I-K.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.280]   That's the extension.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.280]   That pie.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.080]   That is not that pie.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:58.280]   I think, don't type that in kids because I think I got some of the letters wrong.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.600]   Yeah, so that's all I got.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   The changelog.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.720]   And that is the Google changelog.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.720]   What do we think?
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.480]   What do we think of Lollipop?
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.320]   I mean, there's material, and so all these new materialized apps, and I realize inboxes
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.080]   a material app as well.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.600]   I like the look, but that's just a new look.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.120]   Or does it really change how you use stuff?
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.920]   I think it's more of the interactions.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.920]   So I haven't played with Lollipop.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.360]   I didn't load into the early builds.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.080]   I want to just be totally surprised.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.080]   I didn't want it.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.080]   Yeah, I want to get the whole first impression.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:33.400]   But from what I've seen, it seems like it's even just more of an interaction, like
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:40.360]   smoother interactions, things slide and bounce and spring are spring loaded and very responsive.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.920]   And I think that that is more than just a visual refresh.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.240]   I think it's a feel thing.
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.960]   But I also think it's very interesting what Calendar's doing, and I guess Bookmarks 2
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.440]   are doing, and of course, Inbox is doing this idea of it's too much trouble for you
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.200]   to organize your stuff, so we'll do it for you.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.760]   It feels like Google Now is kind of infiltrating.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:09.400]   Inbox has these kind of Google Now smarts about remind me later and group these things
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.440]   together, and now we're seeing Calendar adding things to your Calendar from Gmail.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.880]   It's this integration of all these things and like, hey, we'll do it for you because
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.320]   we know best, which is going to freak some people out at first, but once you sort of
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.280]   surrender and let it happen, you see that it actually-- you know what?
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.360]   I don't want to waste my time transcribing an event from my Gmail to my Calendar.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.000]   Like, it makes no sense, right?
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   So like the efficiencies we were talking about earlier.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.320]   So it's really neat to see all this land, to see the Now stuff with the Wear stuff,
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.440]   with the Material Design stuff, the Lollipop stuff, all sort of land at the same time.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.080]   This is a really neat, interesting time.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.720]   Well, but we were writing the correct stuff in the last week.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:59.840]   I said that the new drive didn't have a store offline, and I got corrected on Google Plus.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.960]   Right away, it's very something very helpful.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.160]   And in fact, it does it even better.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   You don't have to remember to do it.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.240]   You just go into the preferences, say store offline.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.400]   You never have to do it before you get on the plane.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.400]   Oh, nice.
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.400]   We store offline.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.400]   Great.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   Nice.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400]   That's particularly for Chromebook users.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   Obviously.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.480]   Yeah, but anyone will say anything.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.480]   With Sense?
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.480]   Wow.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.480]   What kind of a intelligent person?
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.960]   What kind of intelligent person would you trust?
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:32.760]   He shoots Leo and who believes in the future in technology and is okay with a benevolent
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.120]   company that brings it to us.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.120]   See, this is the thing.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.640]   I mean, there is going to be a point at which, and everybody's different.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:44.200]   Jeff will never feel like it's creepy, but there is a point for everyone at which it
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:49.200]   goes, "Why do I really want them to know who I run with all the time?"
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.640]   Well, there's creepy lines for everybody.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.640]   So I mean, yes, it's nicely convenient that I could type "run" and it'll know, "Oh, that
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.040]   means you're going to go out with Kevin four o'clock this afternoon to run Santa
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.000]   Rapark."
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.680]   I understand the value of that, but it's kind of like, "Don't you think that's a little
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.040]   creepy that would do that?
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040]   That knows that.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   Let's keep track of that."
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040]   No.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.760]   You know exactly why.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.040]   The creepiness comes from not knowing why, from the mystery of it.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.440]   Creepiness comes from also probably an anthropomorphization of it.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.200]   It's a human doing it, maybe.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.200]   Right.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.560]   Like if I left for work at 8.30 every morning and one morning my neighbor showed up at my
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.760]   gate with a cup of coffee and handed it to me and said, "You know, I noticed you go
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.560]   to work at this exact time every day and that you stop for coffee, but I thought, "Here,
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.240]   I just bring it to you."
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.440]   I would be grateful and yet weirded out.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.440]   You know, like you know, I...
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.440]   Depends if you looked at you like that.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.440]   I brought you some coffee.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.440]   Oh, they got me.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.440]   You guys are so happy.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.440]   I put his blend in just like that.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.440]   Have a good day, Dina.
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   No, that wouldn't be good.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.440]   I'm a little too good at that.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.440]   You know, but then this past week it was like, "Hey, Google, now let me know.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.920]   I have to change my clocks.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.440]   Google, now let me know where my local polling place was."
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.440]   Yeah, that's pretty cool, isn't it?
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.440]   You know, I was like, "Oh, this is okay.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440]   Yeah."
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.960]   I told me, "Who got elected is my representative."
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   That's kind of cool.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.960]   It tells me what my PG&E bill is.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.640]   Yeah, I've gotten that one too.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.080]   Well, that's good for me because I always forget to pay it.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.560]   Well, your case, you forget to pay them, so Google's helping you.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.800]   Yeah, in fact, it'd be nice if Google would just pay it.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.800]   Google, could you?
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.800]   It's only $7.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.800]   Just pay it.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   Yeah, just pay it.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.720]   It'll be like, "Pay with wallets."
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.440]   It'll be like when you go to the toll booth and the tall guy says, "Hey, the guy ahead of
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.440]   you just paid."
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.040]   Just for everyone to know how Google would just pay a bill for me, wouldn't you?
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.040]   Just once in a while.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.040]   A little bit.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.880]   That would be a great PR thing for everybody to be funny.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   Hey, if you were...
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.400]   We put people in the people who paid a bill for each of them.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:58.000]   If you were a Canadian woman and you'd like more people to see your boobs, what...
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   Ah, ah.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.240]   Probably the best thing to do is to sue Google for showing your boobs in Street View.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:08.240]   I know every story that's reported, it showed the photo.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:16.200]   So first of all, Maria Piagrio was sitting on her stoop of her house in public.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.040]   And when she wasn't naked, she just had a low-cut thing on.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.560]   I'm not going to show it because I don't want to pander.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.160]   But the Street View car goes by, takes a picture of her.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.680]   It was a flattering angle.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:29.880]   It was maybe an angle that she wouldn't have...
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   It's the angle of the dangle.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   That's really the problem.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:34.880]   So two years...
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.320]   Now they blurred her face because they always do.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.520]   But they didn't blur her boobs.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.840]   Not even her boobs, her cleavage.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:48.760]   Two years later, she sues Google to blur the rest of her as well as her license plate and
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   address.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.640]   I guess I kind of understand that if she's getting, "Hey, you want some coffee?"
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:02.800]   She demanded $50, $45,000 for emotional damage, including depression and mockery from her coworkers
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.040]   at a quote, "well-known bank," quote, where she worked.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.920]   The problem with that is all those ass...
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.920]   That's true.
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   Go-workers, not Google.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.200]   Google agreed to blur out more of the image.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.600]   In fact, they blur not only her, but like the whole house now.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.600]   She's like Blurmany.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.800]   She lives in Blurmany.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.400]   But they said, "Hey, you're in a public place.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.920]   We don't have to give you any money."
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.760]   The judge said that the Street View incident while causing a shock for Greo did not appear
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.120]   to be directly connected to the mental conditions she claimed.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.280]   He also wondered why she waited two years to sue.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:44.280]   But this may be more important, the judge rejected Google's public place defense and
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:52.440]   said, "People do not forfeit their privacy rights simply by being in a location others
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.120]   can see them."
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.520]   That's just so wrong.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.800]   That is a shiv to the heart of journalism.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.960]   You're in public.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:09.240]   If we now degrade what we define as public, then we steal that from the public.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.240]   Right.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.680]   Somebody I know wrote a book about that.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.480]   I thought you might have something to say about this.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.040]   There's a stress-and effect, which is that now everybody has seen them.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.040]   But...
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.960]   Isn't it the public bathroom expectation of privacy issue?
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.480]   That's public.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:32.920]   If you're sitting on your front steps in a bikini top, no?
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.000]   It's not quite a public bathroom.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   You're on your front steps.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.240]   I'd say it's different if you were in the backyard in a fence and the drone comes over
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.640]   and digs a different room.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:43.640]   That's wrong.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.640]   That's private.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.640]   She's sitting in front of a public building.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.920]   Anyone can walk by and take a picture of that building and it can take whatever notoriety
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   it gets.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.920]   I got granted.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.840]   I was just saying, "Be on the Internet."
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.400]   Research on Street View.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.440]   I've got a whole tight to defending what's public is public.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.160]   I would say that I think she has the right to go to Google and say, "Blur that out, would
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.160]   you?"
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160]   And they did.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.000]   She did win an award a few thousand dollars, not all the money she asked for.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.200]   Like two grand, yeah.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200]   But you see what this leads to?
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:22.920]   A pianist now wants a bad review taken down under the right to be forgotten.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920]   To be forgotten.
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.920]   What is the image that point boy chose?
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.280]   I think that's a crying baby.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.640]   Dejan Lajic, Lajic got a mildly critical review in 2010 in the Washington Post.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.160]   And he doesn't want anybody to see it.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.440]   But he didn't go to Google.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.800]   He was actually smarter.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.040]   He went to the source and tried to argue this was the right and then have the Washington
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.200]   Post take it down.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.280]   Which of course they laughed at.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280]   Right?
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   Right.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.920]   So, is he going to go on to Google now?
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.920]   It extends too far.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:58.920]   Right.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.920]   It comes down.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.920]   Right.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:05.920]   I'd love it if I get all the bad reviews of our shows taken down.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.800]   I just want to take away the computers of a few trolls and then life is fun.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.280]   Then life would be good.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:16.520]   Yeah, you can't stop trolls but you can get a bad review taken down.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.480]   So did the Post take it, did not take it down.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.040]   All right.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.040]   Like Zun Zuschrecht.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.640]   Do you want to give us an update on the German as the status of the German?
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.160]   Oh, real, real, real quick.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.920]   So when last we met this soap opera, a couple things that happened.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:39.360]   Basically, the publishers seemed to lose but actual Springer who's leading the war against
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.960]   Google decided to keep a couple of its brands out of snippets.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.640]   Two weeks later, they come along and they say, "Oh, we know we surrender.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.240]   We've lost so much business.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.400]   We too want you to take the snippets, Google."
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.600]   Of course, I don't think it's as simple as it seems.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.320]   I suspect that a Springer arguing that, "See, Google is too powerful.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.960]   It hurt our business unless we have the snippets."
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:08.440]   Though in the article I linked to in D-site, the commenters pointed out what this also
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:16.840]   does is it shows the value that Google is bringing to publishers and for free.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:19.780]   So one could argue that Google is the one who should be charging the publishers for
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.360]   the traffic it sends but of course it doesn't do that.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:23.840]   So this soap opera goes on.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:30.560]   At the same time, we have the new EU head of digital stuff.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.360]   We're talking about having his own similar law across all the EU.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:42.800]   And since last we spoke, Spain did indeed pass the link tax which is incredibly dangerous.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.840]   You cannot opt out of it.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.160]   So you can't say, "Oh, never mind.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.160]   Don't pay me for the links.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.160]   Nope, nope, nope.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.160]   Can't do that.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.640]   It even affects academics.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.960]   It is abhorrent in so many ways."
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:01.160]   I can't believe that it will in the long run be sustained by EU rules but who knows?
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.840]   And it's a law in the books and it's an incredibly stupid and dangerous law.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.200]   And Spain...
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:11.240]   So tell me exactly what happens.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.240]   The link tax?
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:18.520]   If you link, if aggregators, curators, et cetera, if they link to...
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.560]   So the links, they have to pay in basically per link to a fund.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.600]   But then somehow or another, it's uncertain, will be distributed to the copyright holders
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.800]   who are so harmed by being set this traffic.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.720]   So it's really pretty much a tax on Google, right?
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:32.720]   Yes.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.200]   It's a Google tax but it's also a tax on links.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.200]   So it affects others.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.240]   So I was in an event last night speaking to foreign CEOs and stuff and the guy who spoke
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.080]   before me was from BuzzFeed.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.680]   And I'm talking about this and he was saying, "Ooh, I said, "Watch it out, fella."
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:54.800]   And I get taxed by Spain if I link on a show note on twitter.tv to a Spanish source.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.280]   I don't know how this goes.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:01.160]   And again, the other thing is it's like the right to be forgotten or it's like the presumption
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.000]   of privacy in public.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.160]   Once you've dealt with this as a principle, then you have no idea how it's going to be
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.400]   extended.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:10.640]   Wow.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:18.200]   When I was in Spain, I got a lot of, I got some presetention in Spain.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.200]   You did.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.200]   You were on the front page.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:23.560]   No, no, I was in El Mundo.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.600]   I was in, what's this one called?
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.600]   Expensey on.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.600]   It's fun.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:32.080]   I can't read it.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.080]   I like the picture.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.920]   Is that, did they take that or is that a file photo?
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920]   It's a best nice.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:37.920]   You look angry.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.920]   You look angry.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.680]   You look very authoritative.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:46.680]   Wow.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.160]   What does it say about you?
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:52.240]   I have no idea.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.280]   I didn't worry about the headlines or the airport when I saw it and I said, "Oh, OMG."
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.480]   I pulled out the Google app and you can just mark the text.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:02.480]   It did translate.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:03.760]   It was pretty cool.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   What does it say?
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.760]   You remember?
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.760]   I forget.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:12.040]   This professor explains how internet works to wrap students.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.000]   I like that one.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.120]   I'm writing that one.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:18.320]   Let's get that 18-point type in the back of the wall.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.040]   It's more danger in Europe, folks.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.200]   It's not good.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.680]   My argument to Europe, I wrote a 3,000 word essay about this.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.960]   So far, I've not been able to place it in German media about the German problem.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.000]   I'm trying to have any of you watching and have some help for me.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   Let me know.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.720]   A certain major publication that starts with F and ends with Z and has an A in the middle
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:44.160]   should have run it because they've run 8,000 word attacks on me and they wouldn't run it.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:47.160]   But my argument is to Europeans is watch out.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.440]   You are now being seen very clearly as an environment that is hostile to technology,
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.840]   innovation and investment.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.320]   You don't want that.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.320]   Nope.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:59.200]   If I were investing in a company, if I were starting in a company, will I do it in Europe?
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.360]   Absolutely not right now.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.600]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.600]   Take a break.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.600]   And I'm going to take a break.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.600]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.600]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   It's going to take a break.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:24.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:29.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.600]   We're going to take a break.

[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:25.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:28.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:32.600]   We're going to take a break.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.600]   It's a bulletproof phone.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.520]   In the battery life, again, I can't give you the exact because I've only had it for a
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.360]   day, but it seems to be much better than even my Note 4, which is a ginormous battery.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.880]   I love it that it's pretty much pure.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.600]   It's the Motorola experience and I like it.
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.600]   Let me try and shoot it again.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.600]   Is it okay?
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:53.600]   Is it okay?
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:54.600]   It's okay.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.600]   I killed my phone, but I'm okay.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:02.400]   It's Kevlar, which is the same material they use for bulletproof.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.400]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.400]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   I think we got you out of here in time.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   Yes, thank you.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.400]   This is a lot of fun.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.400]   It was great to have Matt on and love doing the show.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.400]   I love Matt.

[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.400]   What's new with Anil Dash?
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.400]   Is that like a new insight?
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.400]   Anil is your co-founder.

[01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.400]   It's our bio tracker.
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:00.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.400]   So now there should be a diff there that shows you like a difference.
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.400]   Show before after.

[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.400]   Okay.
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.400]   So it's not just that Anil is their partner.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.400]   This is actually.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   Oh, no, no.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.400]   It just happened.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.400]   You follow him.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.400]   I do.
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.400]   And he made a change to his bio.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.400]   So that's why you see that.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.400]   LOL activity detected.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.400]   Looks like Leo report found one thing.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.400]   LOL worthy in the last month.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:22.400]   So is that because I used LOL in my tweets?
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.400]   Oh my God.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   The conversation starters.

[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:32.400]   Hi, Jamie.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.400]   Two whole likes.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.400]   Okay.
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.400]   Never mind.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   I think what you get Leo.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:45.400]   And this on this day in 2010, my most popular tweet was Henry playing dance dance revolution on a connect.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.400]   Yeah.

[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.400]   Hi, Felicity.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:54.400]   She's at the BBC.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400]   Anil Dash again.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:01.400]   Anil, you know that every time you change your profile, I'm going to get this.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   He's spamming your think up stream.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:04.400]   Anyway, try it.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.400]   It's great.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.400]   Think up.com.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:07.400]   We love it.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:08.400]   We really love it.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:09.400]   Thank you so much fun.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.400]   You can see it's so much fun to play with.
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:15.400]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.400]   They call it CUNY.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.400]   And we love him.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:27.400]   He can also be read in his brand new book, which is called Geeks bearing gifts.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.400]   And where can I get geeks bearing gifts?
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.400]   Well, I'll put the links up on my blog tomorrow.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:34.400]   You can get it at Amazon.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.400]   Amazon press Amazon.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.400]   We're selling this version and I'll be putting it up on medium shortly.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   Actually, Amazon has a Ted Nelson book of the same name.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   So let's go somewhere else.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:48.400]   Mostly you can't copyright.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:54.400]   There's also Geeks bearing gifts, paranormal dating agency number two.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.400]   It's apparently a romance.
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.400]   I think you should have used this cover, Jeff.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.400]   It would have sold so much better.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.400]   Oh, I lost it now.
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.400]   Where is it?
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.400]   Geeks bearing.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.400]   Wow.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.400]   It's a milli-taden bestseller.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:14.400]   Geeks bearing gifts.
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:17.400]   That's actually just Geeks singular.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.400]   Anyway, you could find it.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.400]   So you said it is available on Amazon.
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:26.400]   Yeah, not yet in Kindle, but we'll look at that, but it's available through.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.400]   Is it a long one?
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.400]   It's 200 pages.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.400]   It's like a real book.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:34.400]   It's like a real book, but it's warning.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.400]   It's wonky.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.400]   It's about news and media.
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   So my editor always begged me never to write this, but I just want to do it for a while.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.400]   It sounds like something I have to read.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.400]   Yes?
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:48.400]   I don't know.
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.400]   I believe I'm in the media.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   And I do do so.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.400]   I'm going to read it.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.400]   You are the moony-eyed leader of the information must be freed imperative.
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:01.400]   Did you know that?
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:09.400]   Just Google Jeff Jarvis for a fun, filled, trip-down memory lane.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.400]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.400]   Thank you, Gina.
