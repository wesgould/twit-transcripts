[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   What Jeff had for breakfast.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Basically anything we want to talk about Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   Professor of journalism at the City University of New York author of many great books including Geeks bearing gifts.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   No since being a blogger and being accused of only state or pajamas at home.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   I refuse in every sound check to say what I have for breakfast.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   But you are in mom's basement, right?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   These are my pajamas.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   Actually, we'll find out soon why I'm wearing black because I've been mourning.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   Actually, it's beautiful.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   I like what you're wearing.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   It's very velvety.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   Is it a track suit?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   Yeah, it looks like.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Are you running?
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   It's just a hoodie.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   That's Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   Stacy on IOT.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   IOTpodcast.com joining us from Austin, Texas.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   My daughter is going down for Austin for spring break.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   I hear it's-
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   During South Bay?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   I wonder actually.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   That wasn't the plan.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   But if it is during South Bay, I'll make sure she goes on over and visits.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   When is she heading to Austin?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   I don't know.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   Okay.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Well, if she needs anything.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   I will have her look you up.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   See your modern house.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Your 22nd century house.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   So where do we start today?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   I don't see any-
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   Usually I can see a foothold, a good place to-
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   I think chewy we can really begin with.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   I have two things that I saw that I was like-
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   Oh, you got it.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   I can't wait to talk about these.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   Good.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   Okay.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   One was I saw that Google officially announced that they were canceling the pixel and I was sad for Jeff.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   Oh, they're canceling the lap, the Chromebook.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   I believe so.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   Oh.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   Let's find it.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   Let's find it.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   That's the best laptop ever made.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   Oh, wait.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Now it's not happening.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   Google.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   What?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   It calls Tom.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   Okay.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   This was at Mobile World Congress.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   No, this was a random.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   No, they're not doing it.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   They said they're not doing it.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   They're not making it.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   This is from Ted.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   They're not making it.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   Fred Dali.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   Okay.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800]   In a small meeting with John Elis.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   It's the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   Ricastor Lowe, who of course, remember he was the head of Motorola now, is senior vice president
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   for hardware at the Goog, said that the pixel laptop has hit the end of the line after just
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   two iterations.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.240]   When asked if Google had plans to produce any more laptops, so Mr. Lowe said no plans to do
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   one right now.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.800]   You know, actually, I'm actually glad to see this because now I can pull this, pull the
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   string, pull the trigger.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   I've been waiting on because I was like you, Jeff, as nice as the Chromebook Plus is.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.320]   By the way, I gave it to my daughter.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.000]   She's a college senior.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.160]   She had the Chromebook pixel and she wanted something lighter.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.000]   I brought the Samsung and said, well, what is this?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.680]   And there's a beauty of a Chromebook is she can say, yeah, I'll take that one and just
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   logs in.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   It's just her Chromebook.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.680]   Immediately.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.760]   So she liked the lightweight Samsung, but she, you know, she didn't.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.960]   I don't think she has the same standards for hardware that you do.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.440]   So I have very high standards.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.240]   I'm looking for a pixel replacement.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.120]   And I still think Dell when they come out with a touchscreen, Dell for work, Dell for
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.480]   business Chromebook will be a good choice.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   Have you decided?
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.400]   Well, you know what I did?
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   What?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.520]   I did return the Samsung.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.280]   The sound went out and didn't work.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.560]   So I'd be the decision for perfect.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.640]   And you know what else I did?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.160]   What else did you do?
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.120]   I went and I bought the only lightly used Chromebook pixel 2015 I can find.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   Nothing's wrong with yours, but it's just as a backup.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   I just want to back up.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   I just want to back up.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   I did.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   Did you pay for it?
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   Thousand.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   There were two online.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.480]   One was eighteen hundred dollars.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.040]   Okay.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440]   So somebody cut it.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.480]   And then a nice, a nice, a nice civilized decent moral person charged with thousand dollars
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   for it.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.440]   That's only ones you can find online period.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.600]   There are tons of 2013's that are running about three hundred fifty dollars.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.960]   But you know, I have that.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   I don't want that.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.080]   It's a lot in this morning outfit.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.680]   But yeah, so I bought it.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.800]   I bought a second pixel because I'm not concerned.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.520]   I'll use one at home or one of the office.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.360]   I have the 2013 in the office.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.160]   I'll take one of these in there.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.000]   And but I don't know what.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.800]   So I said, Chrome OS is a huge initiative in the company.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.840]   People hasn't backed away from laptops.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.800]   We have the number two market share in US and UK.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.640]   But we have no plans for Google branded laptops.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.560]   In other words, they're going to let.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.600]   There is no premium Chromebook.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   Well, there could be an opportunity.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   And I don't think the pro will be any more premium.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.360]   No, it's mid range, which is good.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.600]   I mean mid range is new too.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.800]   They were they were all low end.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.040]   They're all all tinny low end except for the pixel.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.280]   I think Google should have waited until somebody made a decent one.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.560]   Now, the truth is they didn't.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.760]   I have no idea how many they sold.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.880]   Very few, I'm sure.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.920]   It was just a way to show what Chrome can do.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.120]   But now we don't have that.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.520]   Now, if you want to go out, if I convince somebody to buy that Chromebook and buy the
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.760]   best Chromebook, they can get there going to get a mediocre Chromebook.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   Compared to what I do.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.520]   By the way, there is an update Freda week then put in this because Osterlo maybe gotten
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.360]   a little hot water.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.640]   I don't know because he sent us an additional comment regarding the future of Google branded
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.840]   laptops, whether called pixel or not.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.200]   I should clarify.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.320]   We don't have any plans to discuss at this time.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.240]   That's just like I got in trouble.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.840]   Yeah, at this time, but it implies that maybe at some time they will.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   I wish you wouldn't do that.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.360]   If you're not going to do it, don't do it and let us then pick the best one available.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.840]   Because otherwise I was waiting for pixel three, right?
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.320]   So the Asus is going to have it.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.200]   You tweeted that, Leo, that there is an Asus with more memory.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.360]   Come in, or RAM come in.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.040]   I think that's really good.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   That's the one to watch.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.600]   Asus makes great stuff.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.400]   They do sell the Pixel C tablet still on the store, which is.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   They do.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   And I have two of them too.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   Kind of surprising to me, frankly.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   I love it still.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   I love it.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   You were the only one.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.000]   It took a little bit of use too.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.320]   I love my, but I also love my Nexus 7 and that's gone.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.280]   I mean, this is Google.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   It's a shame.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.000]   So I put up a post from, do you know, to reek, Krim?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I do not.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.760]   I mean, I know that maybe you've mentioned him before.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.400]   So he put up a post on Facebook just asking, and I don't think coming off the Pixel is necessarily
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.680]   the basis for this kind of worry.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.960]   But he adds it up and just starts to ask whether Google is the new Microsoft.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.480]   They've got these chat apps that nobody's using.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.040]   They come out with hardware, they stop, it's confusing.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.240]   Maybe a little overblown, but you know, one always has to wonder one always has to ask.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.160]   I really like and really use what Google does.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.080]   But when they desert you, I don't want to sound like the guy who complained for 20 years
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.680]   about Google getting rid of an RSS reader.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   I have been kind of intrigued.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.320]   I still have said about that though.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   Right.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   I mean, I use Feedly, so I still have an RSS reader, but I did tweet that what we really
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.240]   should do for you, Jeff, is just get a premium laptop.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:38.600]   Just pick one that you just love all the features and we'll put a nice Linux on it.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.800]   And you'd probably be happy.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.000]   If you stuck to Chrome, it would be no different than a Chromebook.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.400]   You'd probably be very happy.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:49.360]   Yeah, but there's things that I can now do, like download Amazon movies and download
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   Google Play and we can't do that stuff.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:10:01.960]   Actually, that's an interesting debate because the W3C has kind of certified Google and Firefox
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   and Microsoft's decision to put copy protection into their browsers.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.840]   This is a requirement of Amazon and Netflix.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.480]   And I just read somebody, I can't remember who it was, kind of castigating Tim Berners-Lee
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   at the W3C for kind of surrendering to DRM.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.920]   Like, he said, you know, you don't have to agree.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:37.080]   Tim Berners-Lee, according to Mike Masnick, love Mike in the InTector, offers depressingly
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.000]   weak defense of his decision.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.880]   So DRM is now in the HTML5 or at least, I mean, with Tim Berners-Lee's endorsement,
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.400]   will be in the HTML5 standard in the form of encrypted media extensions.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.520]   Oh, speaking of Mike Masnick, his legal fund is active.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   Oh, good.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.880]   Because he's being sued by the guy who did or didn't invent email, depending on whether
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   you're a camera driver.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   Oh, can we start it on that?
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.080]   I was like a sued.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   And good.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.440]   So Mike has, is it on tech dirt.com?
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   I bet it is.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   I'm sure it is.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   I don't need it.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.240]   It was a couple, a couple days ago that I donated, but it's, I think it's through a
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.240]   different organization.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.320]   And maybe I don't see any link on the front page here.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.360]   Oh, what if I donated to somebody's non-existent legal fund?
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.160]   Well, they'll be very, they'll be very happy to get the money, I'm sure.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.520]   It's the Tech Dirt Survival Fund.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.320]   Boy, you'd think Tech Dirt would link to it, wouldn't you?
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   It would.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   It's at iSupportJournallism.com.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   Right.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.680]   With a URL like that, how could you not?
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.200]   You had to give.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.840]   You had to give.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   Exactly.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   All right.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.600]   So there's that actually we probably do have quite a few more things to talk about.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.840]   There it is because I support journalism.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.840]   We probably.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.520]   There's also Pixel Assistant on my phone finally coming soon.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.280]   I think I hope.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.680]   We're full assistant.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.120]   Which phone do you use?
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.880]   I have the 5X.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.880]   Okay.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.040]   So Google has said, yeah, we're going to make the assistant more available.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.720]   Do you use Aloe?
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.760]   No, I don't use Aloe.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.480]   Because Aloe has the assistant.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.280]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know about it.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   Who else is in Aloe?
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.960]   I once couldn't find Kevin Tofel.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.560]   So I ping Tim on, you know, messages, Facebook, Twitter and Aloe.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.040]   I would use Aloe, but Google didn't do the one thing.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.520]   I can't, it baffles me.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:44.040]   I can use Facebook Messenger as an SMS app on my Pixel on any Android phone.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.360]   I can use Signal, but I can't use Google's own Aloe.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   I can use Hangouts.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   I can't use Aloe.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.000]   If that would make it the de facto choice, right?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   No.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.040]   Now they're making Android messenger, which is confusing because Samsung's Messenger's
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.320]   got the same name.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.280]   But the Google flavor of Messenger is now going to be called Android Messages.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:15.480]   And maybe that means, you know, when you get the Pixel, they encourage you to use Messages
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.840]   now Android Messenger as your SMS app.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:25.000]   But you can still use Hangouts and Hangouts is better for me because Hangouts is my Google
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   voice number.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.200]   It's on everything.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.800]   I can use the desktop to send messages and receive messages.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   Now there's meat.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.600]   I'm just got diggity darn it.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   What's meat?
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   Why?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   Who is in charge over there?
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   Hangouts for business.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.960]   I'm glad that's what Tariq was saying.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.640]   This is looking a little wacky.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.560]   So meat, an enterprise friendly version of Hangouts because they're just aren't enough.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.280]   Does that mean it's, I mean, Hangouts was always enterprise.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   I mean, I used it at every single company I've ever had.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.720]   It's intended just to do the video conferencing stuff, right?
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.520]   So it's like telepresence?
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.520]   No.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.800]   No, but I guess it's strip.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.880]   I think the plan is, and I feel like this has been mentioned before, to get video conferencing
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.400]   out of Hangouts and put it in something else.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.440]   How do you guys feel about video just in general like their casual work conversations?
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.120]   Do you, the only time I ever use it was with my mom and other family members, you know,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   the longest-distance family members.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.120]   So it's like being with a family.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.600]   I would never, like if I called you, I wouldn't do a video call.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.040]   I get lots of, I get lots of requests now for video interviews with people.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.040]   And I'm kind of like, you know, the benefit of not.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   Can't we just do it on the phone?
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.200]   And you know, I think they want to see your, say, see, they want to see you on your pink
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.040]   beanbag chair.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.040]   That's why you get the request.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.880]   That is my daughter's pink beanbag chair.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   I don't like the story.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.440]   An addition to the Stacey K's story.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.400]   There is a, there is a pink, amorphous pink blob in the corner now.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.600]   It is, it's a monogrammed amorphous pink blob.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.640]   It's, it's, she comes in and she keeps you company.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640]   That's cute.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.920]   She comes in and draws and reads and talks to me and tells me I'm not a real writer.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   So what?
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.240]   She, she's a, she's a real writer.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.800]   She writes fiction and she's me to write fiction.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.400]   Unfiction writers are not real writers.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.560]   It's, it's very cute.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.880]   That's really sweet.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.920]   That's actually kind of a sophisticated concept.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.120]   She is a sophisticated.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.920]   She's very sophisticated.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.920]   So is that why you're wearing morning, Jeff?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.920]   Because the pixel is, is dead.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.960]   That's why you're wearing the wax.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.560]   I have the truth is I always wear black, but I'm co-op, you know, yeah.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.960]   You know, when you, with your hood on, you did look like a little like death incarnate
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   coming with you.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.160]   Very short cheekbones and like, I was like, Oh, dear Lord, that is frightening.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.680]   I'm so glad Stacy's picking on you now instead of me.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   Jeff is laughing.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:15.400]   It looks like Tariq pulled that down or because I went to the link and it's, it says this
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.880]   is no longer on Facebook.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.960]   Oh, oh, sorry, Drake.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.120]   Or maybe it's a private, maybe it's a private.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   It'd be as pro private.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.600]   Oh, maybe that I'm doubly sorry.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.240]   Anyway, it was a good argument.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:32.040]   So do we want to talk about the cloud failing?
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.480]   Why would we talk about yesterday?
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.320]   The cloud failed us all.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.480]   Amazon's S3, it was just the S3 East, but it was.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.640]   It's always the S3 East.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.080]   Is it really?
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.160]   That is, that is the most common one that goes down.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.760]   It's one of their older data centers.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.320]   And it's also the default.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.880]   If you spin up a S3 instance, it's going to be there.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.960]   So if you're not paying attention when you build your cloud program or when you start
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.200]   hosting stuff on S3, you're going to end up there.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.880]   And the fact that it's a weak place means it's.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.920]   We use Amazon's cloud front as a load balancer for our website.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.240]   Our website did not seem to be impacted by it.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.440]   And maybe that's because we're on West or because, and I think you can set this up.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   There's a failover.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   So if one.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   Yes.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.800]   So these are, but a lot of sites, a lot of slack was gone.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.040]   This kind of drove me nuts because slack, like I used to write about the cloud and spent
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   a lot of time talking to people about how they architect things.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.680]   And it is possible to have your site go to or have Amazon go down or one availability
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.040]   zone go down and not be affected.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.320]   You should have a failover.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.200]   So failovers now that is more expensive.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:01.520]   And it does require a level of sophistication that might not be available to you.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.520]   I don't know.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.560]   I feel like it's almost inexcusable for like a site like Trello or slack to go down because
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   people pay for it.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.400]   It's an enterprise service.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.680]   Medium was down apparently.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.160]   Was media just your list?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   I don't know.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160]   They don't know.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160]   Okay.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.960]   There's that Jarvis fella.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.360]   They came back by 3 p.m. Pacific.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.920]   So they were pretty much fully normal by 310 Pacific.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.960]   So it was an outage of maybe, I don't know, five hours, six hours.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.600]   That's a pretty long time.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.120]   That's a long time.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.560]   The error rates began at 8.40 a.m.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.040]   This is from Amazon's report.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.400]   Error rates in all S3 centers began to quickly climb.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.080]   Our alarms went off by 8.50 a.m. Pacific.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.280]   Error rates was significantly elevated.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.400]   Very few requests were completing by 8.55 a.m.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.440]   We had multiple engineers engaged in investigating the issue.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.840]   Our alarms pointed at problems processing customer requests in multiple places within
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.200]   the system across multiple data centers.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.400]   So maybe it was more than just the Easter, maybe the East failure created system load
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   elsewhere.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.480]   At 9.41 a.m. we determined the servers within S3 were having problems communicating with
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.480]   each other.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.480]   S3, I didn't know this, but they use a gossip protocol, spread servers, state information
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.920]   throughout the system.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.880]   That's how they're supposed to root around failed or unreachable servers.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.720]   But the gossip failed.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   The gossip failed.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.320]   On Sunday, we had seen a large number of servers that were spending almost all their
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.560]   time gossiping.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.000]   I'm not making this up.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.920]   And a disproportionate amount of servers had failed while gossiping.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.720]   So maybe there was a gossiping issues.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.880]   So in fact, they think it was related because at 1032, after exploring several options,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   we-
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.560]   Your chat room is smarter than all of us.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   This is 2008.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.160]   What am I looking at?
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.240]   Jeez, Louise, I never make mistakes.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.200]   You had one job, Leo.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   One job, Leo.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   One job.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.680]   As Leo goes, so goes the world.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.920]   Apparently this happened in 2008.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.680]   It did.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   I think people used to say they called that one.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.080]   I swear to God, the article I was reading from was dated by Tyler Durden, February 28,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   2017.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.880]   But for some reason, Tyler decided to quote an old Amazon event report.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.600]   This is from several years ago.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.480]   That was when Skynet failed.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.960]   That was what they called it.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.120]   The Skynet failure.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.360]   I remember that failure.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.840]   Do you think this though, what does this mean?
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.480]   I mean, you shouldn't trust the net?
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.600]   Oh, oh, I have so many opinions on this because, again, that's what people pay me for or something.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.720]   I should never read articles by Tyler Durden, probably.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   That's the first thing.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.520]   Wasn't he the guy in first love?
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.920]   First rule of journalism.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:14.120]   Yeah, first rule of journalism is don't read Tyler Durden bylines.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.240]   There's no Tyler here.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   No.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   So tell me what happened.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.480]   Oh, I don't know what I was having fun reading about gossip.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   Yeah, I didn't realize they had an error report out yet.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.680]   Yeah, I think they don't.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.040]   I think that we don't have the analysis yet.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.840]   So yeah, without knowing what happened yet and if someone finds it, let me know.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.480]   S3 is a bedrock service for Amazon.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.560]   It's their storage service.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.200]   It is their basic storage service.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.960]   They have all kinds of crazy fun stuff there.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.920]   So where was I going with this?
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.480]   Oh, but Netflix didn't go down.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.080]   Some of the sites that did go down, I worry that they are not architecting.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.520]   It's hard to say don't architect to Netflix as standards because Netflix is like the company
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:07.040]   that gave us chaos monkeys and this concept of designing for resiliency.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.240]   But and again, since we don't exactly know what happened yet, it's hard to say.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.160]   But I think better planning is probably good.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.520]   And I mean, even AWS, their dashboards were down for a little bit because they hosted it
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.360]   on S3.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:32.160]   So hosting your dashboard notifications on a site that might go down as kind of an example
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.080]   of this.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.640]   So I don't know.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   It also took down the Internet of Things.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.280]   Oh, did it?
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   So I think AWS is suffered too.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.440]   Yeah, it took down if this then that.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.240]   So a bunch of people are playing about that.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.880]   And that's the backbone for IoT in many cases.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.000]   For some people, but there's always you can always go to the base service, but it also
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.600]   took down Ring, the doorbell company for they had problems.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:07.920]   Canary, the security company, Piper, and I want to say something else.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   Lots of people.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   Probably lots of other things.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.400]   Runkeeper was down.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.240]   Imager was down.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.480]   Docker's registry hub was down, which meant that probably you couldn't register a Docker.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.840]   Doesn't mean Docker was down, but that's a big deal.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:32.400]   At least now searching for any explanation for Amazon, all I've seen here is that it wasn't
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.080]   an outage, but in a case of increased error rates.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.800]   That happens because I mean, so he stays.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   He's right.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   What?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   There's more errors in the world.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   I tell you.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   The world is falling apart.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.200]   It's all because of the you millennials.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Anyway, everything's.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.920]   I'm not a millennial.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.400]   I'm a hardcore Gen Xer.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   All right.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   With millennial tendencies.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.200]   I can't blame you then.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   No.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.000]   So all right.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.200]   Well, next week we'll tell you what happened.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.400]   I'll read from a more recent report.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.040]   2009.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.600]   Next week on twig.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.120]   2009 somebody tweeted according to our chatroom somebody tweeted they couldn't turn off their
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   smart lights.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.400]   So they couldn't turn them off using issues than that.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   Right.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   You could still turn them off.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   You go to the switch and turn them off.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.560]   And I will say to you here we go.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.680]   Wink has local local access in your hub.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.240]   So the Wink hub I could still control my devices.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.280]   Smart things is actually hosted in AWS and my smart things stuff actually work just fine.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.720]   If you have in-stion gear that was going to be fine because there's local hubs in control
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   there.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:47.080]   So maybe relying on if this and that or your core stuff may not be the best idea.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   I said I went to a site.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.320]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.480]   Like is it that wasn't is it down for me?
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   Yes.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.880]   Is it down or is it down for me or just down?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   Is it down was down?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Yes.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   Oh.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.240]   It just shows you you can't rely on it.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.320]   That's isn't that funny.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320]   So yeah.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.400]   I mean look at these happen all the time right the way the the Internet is.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.920]   It's not fragile but it's all interconnected and it's not the I mean you get power outages
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.200]   too and the grid I mean things happen.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:26.920]   I once had to walk downstairs and open my garage door manually because I know I almost
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.320]   didn't know how to do it.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.560]   Neo said he couldn't close his IoT garage door.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.960]   There is a string on all garage doors.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.880]   They work even if the power is out.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.360]   I was vision of Stacey in her soil and green fortress.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:50.120]   So the last thing on the Twitter on Amazon's web services Twitter fees for S3 we believe
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.560]   we understand root cause and are working hard repairing future updates across all services
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:00.480]   will be on dashboards that though is from yesterday and is so they radio silence from
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.200]   AWS at this point.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   They still I mean it takes a bit to.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.440]   I'm sure I do not.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.720]   I do not want to be one of those engineers with his hair on fire.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.280]   Hey I have to apologize because I did not disclaim Amazon web services is a sponsor of
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280]   our podcast.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   All right we forgot that.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   Yes.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.000]   I said that I don't know how that affects anything but I should say it because then you'll know
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.560]   I guess and you can I believe in doing that I agree it's an important thing to say so didn't
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   you know.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.560]   Oh you know what I mentioned ring too.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.120]   I don't know if that matters as going down this is a problem is bring is also this at
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.080]   some point we just get the whole thing is a zone.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.120]   Everything you are so popular you are so rich and successful.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.480]   Everything we talk about a podcast.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:57.280]   You see by the way podcast the greatest sponsor Oprah Winfrey is thinking about throwing her
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.960]   head into the ring for 2020 so was Bob I got a big CEO of Disney.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   Oh whoops.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:12.360]   And I guess what both have deduced from the past election is you don't have to have political
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:18.760]   experience to run and win or knowledge or expertise or I would vote for Oprah she's cool.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   Oh she would drive me nuts.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.640]   Well the speeches would be a little.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.760]   Oh she'd tell us all to go to sleep.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.840]   Well that's Ariana.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.400]   She'd tell us to keep lists of the things we've accomplished today.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.240]   She's run a successful business and she's probably overcome quite a bit.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   She's brilliant.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.480]   And yes true to all of that.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.960]   She also drives me nuts and you'd get a car and you'd get a car and you'd get a car.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.040]   Everybody look under their ballot boxes.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.720]   Mobile World Congress you want to talk about that let's take a break and we'll come back
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   we'll talk cause a lot.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.880]   I'm sure they talked a lot about it on all about Android yesterday because it's a lot
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.320]   of Android device news in fact it's mostly Android device news we can talk about that
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.720]   a little bit.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.360]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.580]   Let's see this week I'm Blue Apron I made a lovely oodle noodle soup that was so good
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:21.240]   discovered a new ingredient called verjou verjus it was amazing used blood orange juice in
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.680]   the couscous that was incredible.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:31.600]   I did a lovely tempura cod and then day before yesterday I ran out because we had all three
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.280]   I'm waiting for an Xbox.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:42.160]   I did a chicken breasts couscous and sauteed broccoli and I discovered a new way of doing
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.920]   capers of kind of sauteing them till they're crispy it was and then using that as a topic.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:52.080]   See Blue Apron's great cause I like to cook I really do and he one of the nice things
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.920]   about cooking especially with your family or cooking for a loved one is it's kind of
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.320]   this wonderful sensation that you're making you're doing something really wonderful for
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   them.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.960]   The house fills with beautiful aromas and they come home and you go yeah and you sit
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.320]   down here's your dinner and it's just wonderful.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.400]   I also like the creativity involved but one thing it's hard to come up with new recipes
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.920]   new ideas a lot of times I'll make the same thing over and over again sometimes I'm just
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.760]   I don't have too tired to shop and I'll we'll eat out and we've really been trying to cut
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.000]   back and eating out eating out is bad not just for your pocketbook but there's lots of
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.320]   calories and this delicious food that they make for you and I just prefer to make something
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.240]   healthy and fresh from Blue Apron.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.840]   Now here's how it works Blue Apron will deliver to your door a refrigerated box nothing's frozen
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.680]   even the meat the fish there all but they're all nice and chilled you pick the menu so

[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.600]   So there's no waste I had one blood orange even the verjou I only needed like a quarter
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.360]   cup of it so it came in a little tiny verjou bottle it was so cute.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.760]   The meals cost less than ten dollars per person you can prepare them in about forty minutes

[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:49.320]   oven. Thank you Stacey thank you Stacey. Thank you Mrs. Haganbotham.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.360]   So I will say this we talk about it on the podcast tomorrow but Kevin had a problem with
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.960]   his oven. What happened? One of the heating elements just didn't work so they sent it back
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   and they apparently support was great but I was like oh Kevin I'm so sorry he's like
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   Barb that's his wife didn't even mind. These things happen you know they do yeah and I will
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.880]   you know I mean I saved the boxes so I could send it back if I had to but oh heck yeah yeah.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.040]   Do you have a warehouse with boxes of the stuff that you bought? Mostly I don't save boxes this
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.680]   one I'm saving the box for but usually like if I'd say computer I save it for a week or two I don't
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   save it who wants to have I used to and I gave it's like too many boxes. Yeah I finally went through
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:41.720]   the attic. Yeah your husband does he stop did he stop? He had to stop because we started buying
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.960]   because I started buying so many things. That's why I stopped yeah so it only works if you don't
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.320]   buy a lot of things. Exactly but when you're but when you're in our business you got to try
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.680]   everything right? Well I say I only try like half the things because everything would be crazy.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:05.800]   Oh you couldn't dry everything. No. What is bears you? Is it green juice? No it's wine colored.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:13.400]   It might be that a wine but they say it's a great it's a highly acidic acid juice made by
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.840]   pressing unique I'm sorry Unripe grapes crab apples or other sour fruit. It's used instead of
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:26.040]   lemon juice but it has this wonderful flavor. Apparently it's a middle it's from the middle ages.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:33.240]   It was widely used as a condiment or an ingredient in sauces in the middle ages. We used it to deglaze
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:41.480]   after I sauteed the chicken I deglazed it with verjou. Okay. And it was really good and Lisa
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   doesn't like vinegar so I thought this was a good alternative to vinegar because it has kind of a
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.720]   you know it's kind of vinegary but without being vinegar. You like the verjou right?
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.600]   Do you remember that? No you didn't like it did you? Okay never mind. She doesn't like she doesn't
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.320]   like tangy stuff. I don't know why I like tangy stuff.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:15.000]   So there you go. How about that huh? Indeed. All right. So the World Congress. Yeah mobile
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   World Congress. So lots of phones. Lots of phones. Nothing from Google. But there's the LG G6 which
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:32.920]   looks very nice. It's a weird dimension. It's actually two by one. And they said they wanted to do
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.600]   that because they wanted a 5.7 inch screen but they wanted you to be able to operate it with one
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:42.280]   hand so it's tall. And I don't know what I might like that. Yeah I mean I think that look there's
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.800]   these phones are all the same now right? It's just how many rounded glass slabs you know so you need
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.120]   something to differentiate. So that is something people complain about is the big phones are hard
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.840]   to operate with one hand so you know maybe this you know what I want. I want to phone so when I
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:02.760]   pick it up I immediately know what top is. Oh I agree with you. They're all every phone. You've
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:09.560]   got to turn them around. It's like it's like the USB problem right? So either there is no top
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.800]   which is one possibility or there is some kind of bumpy thing or something so I just know what
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.320]   the top is. Speaking at USB this wasn't at Mobile World Congress but Wall Street Journal
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   published a rumor but since it's Wall Street Journal I think it's very credible
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.840]   that Apple is going to abandon the lightning port on its new phone and go type C.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:37.720]   Thank you. I mean it's a it's going to be very upsetting to people like me who bought a lot of
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.000]   lightning port accessories. God just pick one standard people. I don't need that many accessories.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.120]   Well the story goes apparently that when Apple adopted lightning in 2010 they were they're part
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.400]   of the USB-C coalition and they in fact were an early adopter on their MacBooks but it wasn't
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:01.640]   ready in 2010 and they wanted to get rid of the 30 pin it was taking up too much room so they
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:08.200]   opted for lightning but but now this is going to be a painful switch. People are going to be very
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.160]   upset because I mean I've spent hundreds of dollars on lightning cables lightning docks.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:18.680]   I still go I bet you guys do too you go to hotels and they still the clock radio so has a 30 pin
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:25.160]   dock right like they even bothered updates six years ago so they'll be in good shape.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.080]   I noticed and this is this is like the tiniest portion of my life but I bought a suitcase a radon
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:38.360]   I think is what a radon connected suitcase with like a charging port and stuff in it
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:46.520]   and an app because it was a smart suitcase. I loved it. You suit your suit case has an app.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:56.600]   Okay I sent it back and the reason I did is because it used old school USB micro USB and I've
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:03.640]   got my phone charges on USB-C. C is great. C is the easy way to go.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.760]   Yeah. But I didn't want to buy a dongle like a little thing to hang off my suitcase because that
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:14.440]   just felt stupid so but then I was thinking about all these devices out there that are kind of like
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.440]   supposed to be future proofed and now what is the app to.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:26.280]   So okay so this suitcase is very pretty. Yeah it's white or I guess they have different colors but
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.520]   I bought it navy blue. Okay. But just just in case you were wondering it I bought it because I
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.000]   wanted something that charged my phone the battery is built into the suitcase you can.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.240]   One of our sponsors away they made the same kind of thing yeah but they didn't have an app.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:48.520]   So the app is so you can you you it's got a scale in it so you see the weight on the app and then it
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.240]   also and this this was not a functionality. Wait a minute just for this with the suitcase is just
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:59.000]   sitting there. No you have to pick it up. Oh you pick it up. Yeah it gives you the weight.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.560]   You pick it up like the handle has a scale in it. I guess I don't know where the physical scale is
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:16.280]   and then this phone says 32 pounds. Yes. Must have a scale in the handle. So that and then it also
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.880]   like a tracker or a tile it also wanted they wanted to create a network of these
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.320]   rate and suitcases but it didn't use one of those networks it used its own network which was kind of
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.080]   that's kind of a problem because I mean how many suitcases have they sold right. Yeah.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.520]   So that but that's that's what it was. I took it back. You returned it because you were just
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.080]   reviewing it. No I returned it. I actually my husband bought it for me for Christmas because I
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.760]   wanted a suitcase and he knows me and I was like a smart suitcase for my honey. Oh that is really
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:53.080]   sweet. Isn't it? And then just like my wife you returned it. Well yes but for good reason.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:59.000]   Do you know how that guts us right? Jeff you buy it. This is not I buy it. I bought my
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.040]   husband. I don't I can't remember the last time I was able to successfully.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.080]   This is why guys don't buy gifts anymore. Okay he returns half the stuff I buy.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:15.160]   I was bought him a bottle of like really fancy sketch because he's so hard to buy gifts for.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.280]   And he he kind of mocked me for a while. He's like. Oh that's not okay. I mean not in a mean
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:26.200]   way just like I didn't really need this Stacy and then I felt bad about spending a lot of money on
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.480]   a nice bottle of sketch for him. In my family I will confess as I grew up we would all before
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.240]   opening a gift the giver would always say it's returnable. It's returnable.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.680]   This is the way we came to call these living gift certificates.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:47.000]   It's I mean what would Tony Robbins say? Wait stop saying it's returnable. Have some confidence.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.080]   You're gonna love this. Then they don't and then they don't because they never do.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.240]   And they feel very awkward and I wouldn't like that.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.680]   You know what we Lisa and I have worked it out. She just puts what she wants in her in the shopping
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:09.000]   cart and says me a link. This is what my husband's family does. They don't buy any.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.200]   To me it's like a registry for your like presence. I'm kind of like.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   Yeah what's wrong with that? It's a registry. Look at it. I mean part of.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.880]   She says just go to my shopping cart in Etsy and you'll find some surprises.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.360]   Yeah I think you should always have at least one good surprise.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.720]   So you know and if it doesn't if it doesn't succeed that's okay.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:37.800]   I know I know but it's hard because as men we're already you know self-conscious about our gift
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:45.160]   giving. Yeah I've given up clothes impossible. Can't get close. No long since. No okay.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:53.480]   Man pass on this. It's either too big or too small. I mean it's you thought I was thinking.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:59.160]   What were you thinking? I you know I look I look like a circus performer in this dress.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.440]   You can't win. You cannot win. I'm just I'm just saying.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.360]   Next time I'm going to buy you a water bear aquarium.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:15.800]   This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. So water bears are tautigrade tautigrades right.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.760]   They're awesome. That's kind of is that is that Brian shrimp is it the same or.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:27.160]   No they are different but they are like they're algae chomping microorganisms
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.840]   and they live forever. You find water bears that are millions of years old.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.800]   There might be water bears on Mars. Look up the pictures of the close up of water bears
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.960]   because they're so cool. Yeah. Here's like what you also look up them.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:47.800]   There's more. Oh I'm going to Google just Google tautigrade. Yeah and images.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   And so they're really cool but you don't see that. Oh yeah because this is like a micro like
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:06.120]   electron microscope right. So that's really cool. See I could buy that that's on that's
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.280]   that's a that's a that's a yeah I could buy that. No all right. So I'm going to tell you right now
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:16.840]   don't buy tautigrades for your wife. Okay so and so what so Google's doing an app that's like a
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:23.480]   Tamago Google's doing a phone add on that has live they're actually live. Yes because they wanted to
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.360]   do something it was just so different nobody would have thought of it. Well maybe because
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.640]   everybody didn't. Maybe that's the reason you should not do it. Is this project era is an era
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:39.960]   module? Yes. It's the follow on. Is it it felt like the the onion to me. It doesn't seem real.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:46.440]   Here's an early mock up of the tautigrade module that would snap onto your phone.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.680]   I mean they are microscopic so they don't take up a lot of room. So are they trying to show off
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:59.800]   their camera lenses or I mean it's cool that you could see a really small creature
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:08.200]   through your phone. I don't know. So oh oh I get it. So you do see them close up. Oh I see I think it's
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:18.600]   the thanks to science science. Okay so it has like a built-in microscope.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   That's cool. I think there's a PETA fight coming over tautigrades really. No these things live like
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.840]   torture a tautigrade. Yeah that is nice because they because you so you're saying
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.360]   if I got one of my phone it would last longer than the phone.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.280]   Right. What is it? You don't fish they die. What is it?
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.440]   I don't know what their actual lifespan is. I just know that you can freeze them you can do
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:51.560]   crazy things to them and you thaw them out. They thaw it out chunks of ice that have had tautigrades
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.520]   living in them or not living but like frozen in them and they revive them from after like
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:02.360]   hundreds of thousands of years. Yeah like Brian shrimp from but they're not Brian shrimp. I got
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:08.520]   it from venture B before Google canceled ara in August 2016 an avalanche of module proposals
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:14.200]   had poured in from outside developers over a thousand of those there were at least 100
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:22.600]   credible submissions that Google was going to pursue including the water bear aquarium and
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.560]   Google shut the tautigrade program down quote we were literally like a week away from connecting
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   the optic stack to the app it was like all working it was one of the few things you couldn't possibly
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.040]   ship a phone with there was no way apple was going to produce a phone that did that.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:45.640]   It would have worked it's April fools right they just they just early
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.920]   April fools March fools. I think this is actually pretty cool.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:57.480]   Technology is neat I mean because imagine having a super powerful microscope I don't know what
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.840]   that's what I know that this is an aquarium concept but if you had you could turn a phone into a
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:09.000]   super powerful microscope think about like disease identification in like third world countries
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.560]   that's that could be super cool. I'm sure I mean really these phones are so powerful and the ability
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.440]   to add stuff that would be the real promise of Project Ara I just it wasn't going to be a
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.920]   consumer product that's the real that's the real problem. So I put up how to care for tautigrades
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.920]   the bottom of the Google section. Oh, they suck out juices from Moss Algae and
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.360]   and
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:38.280]   they eat nematodes. Oh good I have a real nematode problem.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   LinkedIn. Oh look at their x-ray radiation these are the cockroaches of the microbiology world.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.920]   Levels of x-ray radiation 1000 times the lethal human dose they could sustain sustain they
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.120]   can sustain it they don't they they can't be. They can survive boiling alcohol.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:46:02.440]   Vacuos alcohol boil out space. Okay. This is this is the module basically how.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:08.520]   How to kill how do you how can you kill a tautigrade?
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.720]   Well how does someone do it with three degrees? Oh well it's less than water but it's still pretty
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:21.400]   hot. Waymo suing uber for lasers. Did we do this last week? No we did that they hired.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:27.160]   Yeah it's close. We did that they hired an executive so I think they went after the executive
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:34.600]   oo-wesky. Anthony Lewandowski apparently took with him when he left
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:43.160]   uber 14,000 confidential proprietary design files. I'm sorry we left Google and went to uber.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:51.320]   Including design this is the key designs of waymo's light are and then shortly after
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:58.600]   I mean the waymo had announced that they had a way to what cut the cost of cut the cost of light
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:04.680]   are but like 10 times right. I thought we did do this last week. Didn't we do this last week?
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:12.520]   No we did. It's all blurring together. Sorry. We should just not talk about cars anymore.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:18.200]   Tens of thousands of Chromebooks have failed because of semantic blue coat.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:24.840]   What if that's the firewall you're going through? Oh this is Maryland's
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.640]   my problem. It's a chromebook problem. It's a semantic.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:35.960]   In Maryland the school system uses 120,000 Chromebooks and multiple PCs all running Chrome
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:43.560]   when they updated a Chrome OS 56 30 couldn't log on and when the PCs upgraded to Chrome 56
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:51.400]   they couldn't reach the web either. It was a man in the middle SSL web proxy that the school
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:59.000]   uses the semantic blue coat. It examines SSL and transport layer encrypted web content. In other
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.760]   words it's a man in the middle. So far so good. If you want to make sure your seventh graders aren't
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:13.640]   peeking into foot pornography but it doesn't work with TLS 1.3 which is of course what the new Chrome
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:21.720]   uses. TLS 1.3 is actually a big improvement to 1.2. We talked about on security now on Tuesday.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:30.520]   And it is also faster and it's more secure but it's apparently not compatible with blue coat.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:41.640]   So don't use blue coat I guess or get an updated version. Famous patent troll
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:52.680]   that's suing Google. Yolas remember them? The case has been booted out of East Texas.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:03.560]   Oh thanks East Texas. Aww. For once. Yolas, God they lost a bunch of big cases. They were suing
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:10.680]   Microsoft I think and they lost the Texas jury struck down their claim to own the interactive
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:17.560]   web. They were suing Google Amazon and Yahoo. They're saying hey we invented interactivity.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:24.280]   By the way Yolas had a partner in that suit the University of California.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   You know what I always thought tech companies with their infinite millions and
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:35.640]   distributed workforce should do? They should actually put an engineering operation in Tyler
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:44.120]   because then you could start stacking the jury in your favor. Well this is good news for this
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.720]   Google. The trial was transferred to Northern District of California.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:58.760]   That's good as Tyler. The company was formed out of a patent file by Michael Doyle who was
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:04.920]   head of IT at University of California San Francisco in the late 90s. He claims he created the first
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:11.400]   program that allowed users to interact with images inside a web browser. That patent means I own the
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:17.640]   web. They sued Microsoft in 1999. They won what is believed to be more than a hundred million
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:24.680]   dollars. You see made 30 million out of that. A subsequent case resulted in dozens of settlements
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:30.120]   from Google from a bunch of companies but Google Yahoo and JCPenney remember fought this four years
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:39.400]   ago. They won. However it continues on. You guys want to explain something to me? Yeah.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:46.120]   I don't want to use a man's plane. Don't don't don't. That's why I said it. This is not a trap.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   Then trap me. This is I would love for someone to explain what's happening with RCS messaging
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.040]   and Google versus SMS because I've been reading it. I just basically didn't want to research it but
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:06.280]   I was like hey I can ask these guys. This is it's an improved form of MMS that Google rich
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:12.600]   communication services and it could do a lot more. It will allow for higher quality picture
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:21.160]   messaging up to 10 megabytes group chats location sharing video calls but carriers have to support
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:31.160]   it. And guess what? We got our own thing. We don't want to plus apples got a you know messages and
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:37.240]   so this and they're not going to do it. So this is really probably a DOA technology even though
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.800]   Google is not giving up on it. I think they got sprint to partner with them.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:48.600]   Well that I see like the regular web or do they use the same dedicated cellular channels like
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.400]   they must. Yeah they must at this point. I mean I'm sure that one thing they go to carriers and
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:59.480]   say you could finally kill that SMS thing. Your SMS servers. Yeah. Do data do data servers.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:05.720]   Okay. In the US sprint and T mobile will support the universal profile standard.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.200]   Verizon has not rolled out of service. Yes but yet but is listed as an official operator.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:15.640]   AT&T is already using RCS but doesn't appear to be supporting universal profile.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:24.440]   I guess universal profile is the authentication. It's not necessary to support it but it will help
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:35.000]   with compatibility. So yeah this is a mess. Messaging is a mess.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.880]   I am with you. It is a mess. So here's a question for you.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.960]   Since I'm only Android and I'm not an Apple worried about what color people are.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:51.640]   How can I SMS from my laptop using Chrome? Only on a hand.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.240]   Or hang out to set. Yeah. Or but that will work. If you want to work.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.360]   What about one of our using Facebook? This is yes you could.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.440]   So this is Facebook is my SMS. If I go ahead and say yes to that request.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:11.080]   You have to use you have to take your phone and make one of those things be your SMS messenger.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.560]   And then if you do that you can use the desktop version of Facebook messenger
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   or signal or any of the SMS compatible programs or hangouts. I always go back to hangouts though
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:31.480]   because it doesn't seem to well I can I can send and receive texts from my phone using
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:36.360]   Facebook messenger but it doesn't seem to propagate to messenger on the desktop properly.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.920]   So I'm not getting all the messages in my that my the SMS messages.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.360]   That's a problem. Yeah. On my desktop it does work with hangouts. Hangouts to and I'm sure Google
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.400]   will break this any minute now but for for now hangouts seems to be the best way to
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:56.120]   send and receive text messages that are in which you are perfectly synced with the text message
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.560]   threads on your phone. Thank you.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:09.160]   So RCS. So Google Google bought a company called Jibe.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:15.800]   I remember and they've created a universal Android client based on the universal profile for advanced
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:21.400]   messaging. Google's also offering a carrier hosted service. This is I'm quoting this from
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:26.600]   Android Authority by the way. Google's also offering a carrier hosted service for operators to launch
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.240]   and manage advanced messaging services so they don't have to do their own infrastructure.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:37.480]   But I my sense is you know this has been going on for a while that the carriers aren't all that
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:44.520]   excited about doing this. The carriers hate anything that you know they don't troll entirely.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.000]   Remember SMS in many cases is still a great revenue stream for them right.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.960]   They really overcharge. Most people by now must have unlimited SMS right.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.160]   I was going to say most people are probably there are probably holdouts on plans that
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:02.280]   don't have unlimited SMS and those are ridiculously high rates if you can count the amount of data.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:08.200]   Oh it's it's hard. But at a certain point you've got to support the service itself and they have
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:13.400]   additional equipment. I mean it's it's a complicated thing if you're trying to make your back in
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.440]   telco infrastructure look like a cloud like one monolithic service where you just split up little
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.600]   chunks for messaging versus having dedicated hardware for it.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.920]   Now this article is from back in November so there there may have been some progress made
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:36.200]   since then. But T-Mobile and AT&T offer some advanced messaging features through their stock
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   messaging apps. But this is pre the universal profile. Google has RCS support messenger 2.0
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:52.920]   but it only works on the pixel XL and Nexus 6P. Sprint is working with Google to bring the messaging
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   app to select LG and Nexus handsets. You could see this is older. I think this is I think this is
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:08.440]   one of those things they say second quarter 2017 in this article is when we'll see the first devices.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.760]   So that's the question to ask is the devices that are being announced now at mobile world
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:19.800]   congress are those universal profile compatible. I you know what this is I feel like this I didn't
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.400]   I haven't paid a lot of attention this I've read up on it but I haven't paid a lot of attention to
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:28.040]   it because I feel like it's a waste of time it's going to be this phone the carriers don't want
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:35.000]   to do this kind of stuff. I think Samsung apparently is going to start doing it.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:46.200]   Here's a a blog post on dated on a February 24th from Amir Sarhongi who's the head of RCS at Google
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:55.240]   and you know selling RCS. RCS messaging is available to users across the world with 27
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:03.000]   carriers and device manufacturers launching RCS to Android users with Google. Sprint in the US
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:11.480]   Rogers in Canada, Telenor in Norway, Orange Deutsche Telekomond globe are planning to support
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:17.880]   the jar by CS cloud, Jibar CS cloud from Google and we'll be preloading Android messages. So I
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:23.480]   guess that's why the rename for Android messages that's the RCS version of messages.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:28.280]   But they're also going to include their standard native messaging app.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:39.000]   I'm a big fan I like to XMPP I'm a big fan of this but I was burned with XMPP I really thought
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.360]   that was going to be a standard and Google abandoned it that was Google talk and they abandoned it and
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:50.200]   so I just I hope that they will stick with this and they can and they can get everybody behind it
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:55.160]   and the carriers will support it because it would be a much better experience and it's the kind of
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:02.920]   thing you need to really you know we're so far behind China with WeChat you know and the things
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:09.240]   you can do in WeChat and these are the kinds of technologies would be enabled and instead of
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:13.880]   having a separate third party app to do it you'd be doing a state of messaging app.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:19.960]   Right so stay on that for a minute in an age of assistant and embedding functionality into
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:26.840]   chats that's what Google is really building that has a lot of appeal you think that the
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.280]   carriers don't want that they want to just do that proprietary they think they're going to invent
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:38.760]   WeChat what's I think that I think that they I may be wrong but I think that they still are kind of
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.520]   wanting to make to squeeze the last penny out of SMS messaging.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:48.120]   Carriers just like give up short-sighted yeah they they just yeah they want to control the
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:52.200]   services running over their network because they feel that because they have the network
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:59.320]   they should be providing the services on top of them and this goes back to their dumb pipe fears
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:06.600]   and if they can control these things they can get a cut of the revenue they can do all sorts of
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:11.160]   fabulous things they just they don't want to be irrelevant who can well they should go for this
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:16.680]   in fact one of the things he's talking about in this blog post is how businesses could use this
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:23.000]   to give much more rich interactive information to customers that message them it's kind of what
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:29.880]   Aloe I feel like Aloe is was kind of moving there but and and really maybe when RCS becomes
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:36.120]   universal with carriers then we'll get that kind of experience in every you know phone for
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:41.240]   instance here's some images this is Walgreens you could start a conversation with Walgreens they'd
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.360]   you could say give them the zip code they give you a map a list they could they say your product
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:51.400]   isn't stock and it's available at this store and you could and you could navigate there here's a
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:59.080]   a boarding pass for a train so this kind of interactivity which Aloe kind of started right
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:04.680]   could kind could come from businesses as well I mean I think this is very there's a lot of reasons
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:09.640]   to do it do you think there's some mistrust of Google though people don't yeah I mean I don't I
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:16.040]   feel like I'm the ghost of Gina is looking back and say remember way right right
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:22.440]   do you want me to put my ghost of Gina costume on we're trying we may not need the ghost next
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:29.400]   week I'm going to be out of the office on Wednesday and we're trying to Jason Hal's going to host
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.040]   the show but we're trying to get Gina on too which would be cool yeah so it'd be great you may not
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.600]   you may have less than a ghostly Gina now I'm putting a pressure on because we really we'd love
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:45.080]   to see her and of course you too too so I you know so that's a good question what's going on with
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.000]   RCS and it it seems like what it is is that you've got to get all these disparate groups to agree to
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.360]   support this platform and Google's the one kind of pushing it along and Android messages will be
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:09.240]   the app for alo no for RCS for RCS and that's that may explain Google's ambivalence about messaging
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   because they hope eventually to get everybody use Android messages with RCS built in and so they
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:23.560]   don't want to put too much stock in alo and hangouts and meet and all these other apps and lord for
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:31.080]   pitch you put all of your eggs in one basket as a company that's making products all right well
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:39.240]   yay so the fact that it is a big deal that at least elsewhere in the world they they're getting
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:45.720]   some support the fact that orange and Deutsche Telekom have agreed is very very big news
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.400]   they at Mobile World Congress they announced 27 new carriers and device global device
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:58.280]   Wow okay see I feel good that I paid attention to this for a little bit yeah but this has been
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:06.520]   going on since 2008 yeah well okay okay well this was exactly the amount of time I wanted to put
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:12.040]   into this so yay and and this to answer your question unlike mobile messaging apps database
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:18.840]   apps this works over cellular networks irrespective of a user's client operator device so it does
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.640]   not require internet access on a phone you could use it on a Nokia 3310 if you wanted to
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:33.000]   okay yeah that is exactly enough in other words you're saying no more right no I'm well okay yes
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:44.200]   yes no more enough RCS but good do we want to go yeah we want to take a break is what we want to
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.960]   do and then we will talk about Google at Mobile World Congress because they are there
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:53.400]   they are part of it our show today brought to you by a segment
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.240]   the leading unified customer data platform I actually had to get them to explain to me I
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:05.000]   I got on a phone with the people from segment they said well okay Leo you're already using what
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.400]   Google analytics right yeah chart be meh maybe using optimisely or mix panel you have lots of
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.320]   different tools to see how your websites your mobile apps your cloud platforms are doing who's
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:22.680]   using them what they're doing with them that kind of thing the problem is each of those let's take
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.960]   a web page each of those is integrated into the web cage with a little clip snippet of code and
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.400]   more and more and more and it's a mess your engineering team spending a lot of time with
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:42.120]   integrations and figuring out how to work segment is the plumbing that makes this all much easier a
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:50.040]   platform that lets you write one line of integration code a single API and it unifies all your data
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:56.920]   all your analytics on any platform from market out of MailChimp it's used by some of the world's
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:03.160]   best companies Atlassian uses it Intuit New Relic Reuters of course it supports all the
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.520]   integrations you want to do hundreds of integrations all the most popular apps for advertising analytics
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:15.080]   a b testing attribution that's just the a's and what's nice is you get the segment dashboard
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:22.600]   and that's where your developer your team can add a new tool can kind of sketch out the plumbing
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:30.840]   what goes where it's a it's it's the easiest way to do this you can integrate a new analytics
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.400]   tool for the data driven account manager one for the app happy marketer another for the data
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:42.120]   scientist who needs a unified data warehouse and segment brings it all together from any source
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.280]   you can import historical data you can customize what ends up in your data warehouse of trust and
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.320]   you know if something happens like yesterday with s3 and one of your analytics tools stops
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.120]   responding no problem segment will collect the day continue to collect the data the plumbing
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.920]   still works and when yours tool comes back online they send it all down you don't miss a bit
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:07.160]   it's the customer data platform that both developers and analysts love because of its elegant API
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:13.320]   it's extensive partner ecosystem if you're out there struggling with integrating all these different
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:19.240]   tools you're gonna love segment and your ceo will love your quickly deployed integrations
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.120]   with zendesk and intercom and app nexus and on and on and on 8 000 of the world's best companies
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.720]   use segment to drive growth and revenue to simplify and save money in the long run
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:35.480]   on a lot of engineering hours twit listeners can try the segment team plan free right now for
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:43.320]   three months segment.com/twit segment.com/twit
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:49.400]   what were you there was something you wanted to say Stacy
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:56.200]   no wanted to bring up no no google at mobile world congress
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.120]   let's talk about it yeah
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:07.320]   some free. Did they do much that was exciting i didn't feel like reaching out to be they didn't
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.200]   make announcements they just okay this is this is android with a torah yeah there's android with
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:20.200]   a torah right why well it's saying hola and hello and all the other languages it's a little it's a
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:27.480]   robot they had a tango tetrahedon so it's inside there's a dengo
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:34.600]   okay but that was a crowd right trying to get in there huh and here's the demo
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.520]   participants are split into groups of four or five people to try it out in person
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:49.080]   here's google's daydreams have VR headset demo inside a tree tech crunch says it's like a dream
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:58.120]   inside a tree because why not uh androidify your bag customize tote bags and you design the
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:05.240]   android yourself and then head over to the print lab this is all pathetic it's very sad we should
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:11.000]   just not even cover this there was a google tuk tuk art tuk tuk's from southeast station for no
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.080]   reason apparently they're big in bar salona having little tuk tuk's oh nice i felt like i saw
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:25.080]   another tuk tuk story about bar salona so for what it's worth uh here's a ski hut with google assistant
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:33.720]   the amount of money to spend on these things wait with a paper deer head on the wall
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:42.760]   because a real deer head would be well you know disgusting uh Texan Texan Texan in the house
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.680]   uh they have tech they have tuk tuk tours in bar salona they're eco-friendly nice oh and there's a
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:54.840]   driverless tuk tuk on display at mobile world congress that doesn't mean it goes anywhere just
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:01.480]   there's no driver well maybe it's i don't know i'm assuming at some point it would drive but
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:08.120]   there you go and here's a little zen of apparently a plastic zen garden because uh you can walk on
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:17.480]   the sand and it doesn't nothing happens and some plastic cherry trees because it's uh spring
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.800]   and you're in bar salona that is not very eco-friendly
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:30.040]   and ice carving this is funny i i i guess fritter glardonnawad took all these pictures and uploaded them to uh
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:37.240]   to tech crunch this is basically like i have to do a story on this so i'm not gonna spend time on it
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.240]   slideshow slideshow a lot easier i can't find that and they didn't actually do any things
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.960]   well i'll take a picture of all the stupid stuff and make a slideshow look at this
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:56.200]   uh so if you want a smoothie you pay for it with a high five and then there's a counter on the wall
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:02.680]   that shows how many high fives oh the poor staff wants to do this at least you didn't have to wear
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:09.960]   you know a hot dog on a stick type uniform didn't like mcdonald's do a promotion like that like
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.160]   you had to pay for things by all like the facility dances no was that yes they did do that you're right
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.480]   um that's right that is stupid every time i see
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.840]   maybe i'm old here's here's i might just be crazy no you don't know old
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:32.520]   but hey that was us making old watch out but i was in a movie theater and they were like
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.960]   you know it wasn't just sign up for a discount club it was like snap a photo of you being at
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:44.440]   this movie theater tag it on instagram and you could win you know tickets and i was like who
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:50.840]   falls for this this is just using you as a marketing tool for these companies and but there
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:58.760]   but free tickets maybe it's the chance it's not even actual free tickets oh they should at least
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.320]   give you a ticket it's the chance to get free tickets i don't know yeah well speaking speaking
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.120]   of weird scams it's playing something to me can you woman's playing this to me well first why am i
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:18.520]   read let me fix that um so so uh when somebody on on facebook tells you to uh don't don't just
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.320]   share this cut and paste it why are they doing that what's what are they getting out of that what
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.640]   why is that spreading oh you see it on facebook all the time all the time what is that because if
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:33.240]   you share it it doesn't have the same uh i don't know it doesn't it then it says
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:40.440]   jeff javis shared this as opposed to being a post from jeff javis but what and and and so what
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:47.800]   does that accomplish um hold on put put your put your one word in here about how we met and it's a
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.600]   test to see if you leave this only if you share that i hate that it's chain letter crap right i
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.680]   didn't put a picture in this post so for some i don't know how this got to be a meme i didn't
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.280]   put a picture in this post but i want to see if anybody reads post without pictures so put
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:06.040]   it one word how we met what that keeps cropping up year after year i don't know and i don't know
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:12.360]   why what what is what is who who gets what out of that idiocy and you didn't and you didn't fall for
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:18.840]   the 20 things did you get a tattoo are you from have you ever been to a jersey questioner thing right
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:25.800]   i don't do facebook has a question and a featured answer about this actually oh and it seems to be
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:34.440]   some what did you google that stacy um it i'm reading through it it sounds like
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:46.440]   well it's a long answer um but this is this is hacker related though so it's copy well it's so
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   this i i can't see if why copy and paste a post warning instead of sharing it are yours warnings
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:59.800]   or they just any post when somebody says something like you know uh you know here's here's 20 things
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:06.760]   trump did in december that made me nuts they say don't share this cut it copy it and paste it into
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.720]   a new post from you and it has to do with the number of posts i'm sure it's about seo
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.560]   oh here's a buzzfeed article on it my community it's political but more than just an opinion but
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.240]   the let copy and paste to share uh la la la la
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:28.840]   you know it all fall apart the lead a good lead you'd find out there we go here we go the theory is
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.560]   the theory says that there that this will be a new text status rather than a share in my
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.400]   existing one so it will be shown more prominent it'll go in your end it'll go in your feed
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.880]   people are tricking facebook by copying and pasting not sharing people are revolts you get
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.720]   against the medium to get their best Facebooks can't figure out this oh they're they're fighting
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:56.600]   the tyranny of the feed i think people the most people who do this don't know why they're saying
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.920]   it they're just they're just saying it right okay so they're they're hacking the algorithm
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:07.000]   there they don't hey you know what we buried the lead youtube has finally launched youtube tv and
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.400]   i didn't even mention it yeah oh is that the thirty five dollar a month one thirty five dollars a
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:21.320]   month you get abc cbs fox and nbc 35 cable channels it's an over the top uh service you get six
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:27.880]   accounts so with 35 bucks a month everybody in the family can have an account you can only watch
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:34.600]   three concurrent streams at a time though um there is you know there are some things missing
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:40.920]   like all the channels from viacom which include mtv and comedy central nothing from toner so no
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:52.680]   cnn uh showtime is an add-on additional cost not hbo and then you get youtube red originals for free
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.800]   you would not that anybody would pay for those um so they haven't announced a date but it will
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:03.960]   roll out in the next few months and it will be market by market right because uh if they're
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:10.680]   gonna put abc cbs nbc and fox they'd have to do a deal with a local affiliate maybe you get the
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:17.400]   local affiliate smaller cities oh and you get the you get the crummy espian channels oh but do you get
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:23.560]   real disney that could be in usa and is it bravo that everyone's excited about where all the real
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:30.360]   housewives they're in bravo is the real housewives yeah nfl content on tv and pc but not mobile and
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:37.080]   that's because verizon as you know has exclusive on that it integrates with chrome cast and google
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:44.120]   home so you can say to your home hey googoo watch the desperate housewives that's the real desperate
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:51.240]   housewives of new jersey and the southern atlantic coast oh but wait this is this isn't on demand
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:58.280]   though this is just like when stuff is on streaming oh oh it is streaming i think oh wait a minute
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:04.840]   no there's dvr style recording of your favorite shows with unlimited space in google's cloud and
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.400]   you have to go through that why go through that effort why not just look up the show and add skip
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:17.880]   oh oh i'm sure it has to do with licensing right oh stupidly uh you can this is challenging
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:23.480]   this is so complicated for consumers i but it's complicated for the companies that want to offer
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.560]   it because all these different stakeholders you say well you can't do that without doing this
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:34.040]   and nobody wants to piss off calm cast um i pissed off calm cast yeah
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:44.120]   so by the way this goes so here it is if you go to it it's uh tv.youtube.com
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:51.000]   and um yeah you know what for cord cutters this might be huge
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:58.760]   hmm no someone's pointing out it doesn't have the scripts network with like hg tv food diy
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:04.360]   a lot of people like those kind of shows well you're gonna if you're that kind of person
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:10.760]   you're gonna keep your cable right but i think what this really is is you've got Netflix you've
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:19.080]   got amazon you've got google play but what you don't have is live events you don't have the academy
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:24.200]   awards you don't have football you don't have the live stuff you want to watch you don't have locals
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.960]   you don't have live local news so this is the ad on service that gives you local live locals
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:38.040]   that's a big deal prices 35 bucks and you know i think everybody's realized by now
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:43.160]   court cutting does not about saving money it's about you know giving a screen giving it to the man
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.400]   but you you're not going to save money when you put a time you add your Netflix subscription and your
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:54.360]   HBO go sub hbo now subscription and and all that it's gonna add up that's why i don't think it matters
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.120]   if you don't have HBO you subscribe to it or you get hulu for the other stuff this is this is i
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.760]   don't think this is intended to be like everything you need it's the supplementary package that
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:15.720]   gives you live locals for cord cutters so the um sequel to uh the good wife the good
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.800]   oh with christine boransky good fight which i really want to watch but i think you can only get that
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:27.000]   if you subscribe to cbs for like six bucks a month yes which is insane yes it's a place
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.680]   we try to do that you can't yeah we try to do that you can't you can't get it on demand you have to
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:37.240]   uh you can only get it on you know what you can get three episodes on demand and then the rest you
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:44.520]   have to subscribe something like that this is this is a what is this no one's content is probably
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:50.760]   that valuable i mean i they all believe it is oh yeah it is going to be a hard way to fall and
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:57.080]   i don't know so i mean somebody like i'm sure if like there was a star wars
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:05.160]   you know there are few there are few i think you know football is one uh you know cnn is probably
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.600]   valuable espians very valuable what we think right because i don't i mean i think it's probably
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:19.320]   more less channel focused and maybe more event like show event or show like i might pay five
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:24.840]   bucks to watch the oscar's live right that's i mean that's what users say is i want it all a cart
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.240]   and that's exactly what the cable company doesn't want to do they don't even want to give you a
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:35.480]   channel a la carte right to buy packages well that's because the music industry was afraid of this
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.040]   too remember it steve jobs forced them to sell 99 cents singles they didn't want to because they
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:45.640]   knew most albums have one or two popular good songs the rest is filler they wanted to sell you
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:52.840]   the whole cd but jobs forced them to and now look at now look at the music industry it's great
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.040]   we'll also look at the paradox there we ended up at a um all you can eat bundle which is like a
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:04.200]   cable consumption right well they know isn't that funny it ended up going to that yeah that was
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:09.720]   that article i was talking about last week the great unbundling right the great rebundling i
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:16.520]   should say everybody's you know going back to bundles consumers in the long run lose every time
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:24.360]   he's he's just not he's just not optimistic today is he consumers well in the law okay in the
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:29.240]   short run consumers lose in the long run they may win but it's going to be the very long run
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:35.560]   the moral arc of history tends towards benefiting consumers yeah yeah in a hundred years you'll be
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:41.560]   able to watch any show you one there you well in a way that's why that's why torrents exist why
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:47.720]   piracy exists because consumer you know this is the thing that most terrifies these big content
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:54.360]   companies and their aggregators is that consumers thanks to technology can disintermediate them
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:20:00.200]   and just steal this stuff onesie tooey and that's why they're so scared of that piracy this is what
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:06.520]   really scares them well there there are a lot of things to think about um the cost of producing
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.080]   content should be certain types of content should be spread across a wide audience even if that
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.560]   wide audience isn't consuming it that's the same argument we do for like broadband that's nuts
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.960]   it's not i mean consumers say you know everybody well you don't
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.760]   you panacea movie i don't pay for a bundle of movies when i go to the movie theater
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:33.080]   you should pay for the show you want to watch and to force this is why there's piracy because
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:39.400]   they forced aggregation they forced all this crap we we stopped buying cd's because you'd buy a cd
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.200]   because you liked that song and there was nothing else on it that you liked and and if the back
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.880]   fired on them and that's because consumers really just want to buy a song or a show shouldn't they
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.760]   be allowed to do that and i think it would work if you did
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:21:03.160]   maybe not h hpo has a bunch of weak series that are powered by one or two really strong series
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:08.040]   right is that that that's the theory right that is this the theory it's also just inertia
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:15.640]   ah what movies movies are there you know it's true i mean like i watch once we cut the cord i watch
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.040]   so much less tv because i had to make an active choice on what i wanted to watch and that was
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:25.080]   actually really nice because i found i had extra hours to oh that's the worst all smart devices
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:30.120]   that's the worst thing from hollywood's point of view i know they that's the real existential
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:36.920]   threat they might not watch it they might not need us at all i've turned a podcast that's an
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:42.200]   interesting theory we need a 500 channel universe not merely because we aggregate because it because
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.320]   it but the bundles the costs but because if people don't have this constant flow of
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.120]   content pretty soon they'll go oh i guess i really didn't need that
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:58.360]   i'm gonna go read a book what's that is it was like that is what i do i'm gonna go feed a tart
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:09.320]   feed my tardigrades it's tardigrade feeding time is posting on facebook a constitutional right
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.440]   this is a fascinating story it's not about whether facebook cuts you on or off or not
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:19.480]   but it's about whether the government of i forget which state uh ruled that a sex offender
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.400]   could not go on social media you see lapaschi writing for wired
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:29.960]   uh lester packing ham jr registered sex offender in 2002
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:39.240]   uh is he he took to facebook to celebrate it recently this miss parking
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.360]   ticket praise to be praise be to god wow but by using facebook he was breaking a 2008
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:52.200]   north carolina law that prohibits registered sex offenders from accessing websites that enable
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:58.760]   people to exchange information where minors can participate facebook is one of those sites he
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:06.520]   fought back he said that's the violation of my first amendment rights yep and scone to the supreme
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:15.000]   court yep interesting wow there was actually what it says further here is that facebook it's not
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.760]   just it's a first amendment case but it's also saying that facebook is you know critical to an
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:27.080]   open society it's it's it's it's a it's a speech utility it's a speech necessity i don't know how
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:38.040]   all that cuts it's fascinating so it's accepted that a state can ban a hacker from using the internet
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.760]   for a period of time kevin just may challenge that
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:50.040]   hmm because but it's also i mean the state can also well the state can limit where a sex offender
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:56.280]   lives right um that's what they argue by the way it's no the sex offender can live somewhere
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.600]   well if this is the this is the primary means of speech
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:06.360]   i don't think you could argue convincingly that it's the primary means of speech yet
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:12.040]   but it's worth and i'm not sure that that that'll be really an interesting case you're right jeff
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.800]   it really is fascinating yeah and where's the the times version
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:22.280]   to i'm trying to find that so they've argued are they arguing they've already argued this in front
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:32.440]   of the supreme court oh um it sounds like is this from 2008 hold on wait a minute wait a minute
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.880]   yeah they've you know they've we're okay what the hell it's in chinese
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.200]   and that's a link to the chinese version what um wait a minute what
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:44.280]   of the new york times it's sort of doing that i think haven't they
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.800]   that's interesting all right yeah i didn't know that i read it in spanish so i'm like okay
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.360]   do you wait a minute really i've started i'm learning spanish and the new york times has
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:59.560]   excellent coverage in spanish that was spanish language addition so i i am practicing my spanish
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:05.960]   by reading it there so so yeah so this is being argued or has been argued well the justices
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   remarks suggested they would strike down says the new york times the north karenalana law under
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.760]   the first amendment right jesus kegan took particular issue with the idea that the law
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.920]   would prevent someone from accessing for instance president trumps twitter feed
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:25.160]   this is no it's a key communication channel between the president and the public this has
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.560]   become a crucial crucially important channel of political communication what gee said no quote
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.000]   so this has become a crucially important channel political communication and a person
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.160]   couldn't go on to those sites and find out what these members of our government are thinking or
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:45.800]   saying or doing so facebook gets to be a right trump saves twitter because of yeah
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:52.760]   no is is he arguing just to be able to get on as opposed to post-host because right he could read
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:26:00.520]   there's a question of speech here uh the the government or north carolina argued well there's
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.680]   other places they can get information uh samuel elito agreed he said i know there are people who
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.640]   think life is not possible without twitter and facebook and these things and that 2003
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:17.080]   was the dark ages he's so grumpy but i don't know that there are any channels of communications
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.520]   that were available at that time that have been taken away but the president only tweets on twitter
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:28.680]   it goes on facebook too though i think don't so justice kennedy said that social media sites had
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:36.040]   become and in some ways had surpassed the public square as a place for discussion and debate right
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:42.120]   on right on right on quote the sites that justice kegan has described and their utility and the
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:47.480]   extent of their coverage are greater than the communication you could have ever had even in the
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:55.320]   paradigm of public square justice kennedy set wow wow so maybe you just need to change your
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:01.640]   sentencing laws because in jail you don't actually have access to these places to social media sites
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.960]   necessarily um so then that kind of raises the question of could you institute a punishment for
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:14.280]   someone like a sexual offender that actually sentences them to not having access to this over a period
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:21.240]   of time which is kind of i mean that would be a way around this yes well we'll find out what
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.160]   we'll think so they also they mentioned linked in and they say that that if if this
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.040]   complaint and wanted to try to find a job the way you do that is all linked in and teenagers are
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.600]   allowed to post information there ergo you've cut them off from being able to get a job
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:44.360]   isn't that fascinating justice kennedy mews that any number of free speech doctrines doomed the law
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:54.360]   interesting really fascinating where do you stand on that should facebook be a fundamental right
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.280]   that can't be well then and then well here's the problem you know lay fellans vote
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:05.160]   i mean there's this there is president for for a lot of people who think that that is crazy wrong
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.480]   and want to change that though but but there's plenty of precedent for a government restricting
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:14.120]   somebody's rights based on that's not covered by the first amendment first amendment is a matter
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:21.960]   of speech so you think that the that the right to speak trumps the right to vote it clearly does
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:27.480]   i mean the constitution i mean that's franchise versus speeches okay though there's another case
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:34.920]   today of a teenage girl who spoke at a uh immigration rally uh she's a dreamer brought here when she
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:41.480]   was young and she promptly got arrested no that is wrong chill does that put on speech
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:49.400]   yeah what was she arrested for hold on well for being so-called illegal no aren't the documents
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:58.200]   she got arrested for being illegal yes are they protected still no not no not in this case oh hello

[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:42.360]   comments so i'll put it at the bottom of other right now hold on i'm getting there here we go
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:48.200]   down there it is yeah oh my god the rundown has so many interesting stories that i hadn't
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.880]   scrolled down to yet look at my mind now we please come on as we go yeah uh so um
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:00.360]   22 she was attainted earlier she was down 22 Danielle Vargas was detained by ice agents
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.040]   shortly after speaking in a news conference in downtown jacks and according to returning
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:12.040]   it was uh earlier her brother and father had been detained outside their home and she had
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.800]   in february and she had hit at that time she was planning to go into hiding she came to the
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:20.840]   u.s when she was seven from so she's not a team where she wasn't born here no but she's not
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:28.120]   protected by a DACA right now we will be a DACA officer okay the DACA me stop um her her DACA
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:32.600]   she didn't get it renewed it was expired she didn't renew well she's in the process of getting
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:38.360]   her in doing that but it had already expired i'm not saying this makes it right but i see why she
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:42.440]   wasn't protected it was a visa a visa overstay
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:48.520]   yeah but what does that do my point is what does that do to speak showing effect yeah
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:55.000]   that would be just does she have a first member right to speech and does this action chill about
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.400]   this wasn't uh yes she could speak but she could also get arrested for being a criminal you know
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.680]   yeah that's that's a completion of two laws i mean it is oh but yeah that
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:12.760]   okay uh sad this frustrates me too now here's a happy story
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:19.720]   the Norwegian news site that's requiring you to pass a quiz before you can share their stories
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:25.880]   before you can comment before you can comment yes i think this is going wonders this is by the way
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.520]   you don't know this because i got on your feed then you re-shared chas Edwards chas is an old friend
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.880]   he was one of our great sales guys at tech tv yeah and he's now at our pop-up magazine
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:43.800]   he was in federated media for a bit because it federated that's right yeah so uh nrk beta
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:53.560]   which is a tech vertical of the Norwegian public broadcaster nrk uh said that um
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:32:00.840]   you have to answer so you have to answer three basic multiple choice questions about the article
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:10.280]   before you compose the comment i don't sure that's a bad idea no i don't think it's kind of interesting
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.320]   you run the risk of less engagement but on the other hand there's are people
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:23.320]   you that aren't reading so yeah it's people people have used comments under stories too just as
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:29.960]   as temporary forums and this cuts that out so they've developed a WordPress plugin so you can use
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:40.360]   this too ah nice um well it also goes to to a to a neat question of defining there's just other
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:47.400]   two other neat questions come from this number one what is informed and number two did the article
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.000]   inform so the quiz could actually be saying this is the core idea of the article you had to read
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.480]   it we know you read it because you want to get into comment but the article did a bad job of informing
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:05.640]   you ah um i can see my editor coming up to stacy 60 percent of our commenters have failed the
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:14.200]   multiple choice article sucks to understand what you wrote we're getting no comments on this page
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:22.360]   why no one understands it um that's awesome by the way apparently it's easy fairly easy to
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:27.240]   hack around it but uh they point out hey if you can hack or you know if you care that much go ahead
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:36.280]   post i'm a runner but first let me hack this quiz amazon go ahead no nope no no it's going to
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:48.440]   congratulate mr b yes because he uh amazon has three oscars on sunday um they uh amazon put
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.000]   money into what what are the movies is it moonlight moonlight manchester by the sea i remember that
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.560]   manchester by the sea because they're on depressing yeah did you see moonlight
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.040]   kcflex sexual assault or
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:09.800]   now is it fair to say that since it was a suit that it was settled
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.360]   and never yes it's fair to say that okay i'm just asking yes
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:21.720]   i've been like i'm gonna hold him accountable maybe he's not criminally accountable fine yeah he was
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:27.720]   never prosecuted there were two lawsuits which were settled and of course part of the settlement
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.880]   was a gag order uh so we don't know what happened or what them uh money was or whether there was a
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.480]   mission of guilt i'm betting not i don't care i mean i i think if someone i mean i'm of the opinion
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:46.600]   that people making accusations and being willing to take them to court most cases it's so rare that
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.560]   you would do that if it weren't legit right so i'm like okay he's not guilty there
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:57.960]   stacy's court of public opinion okay amazon also won for the best foreign language film
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:05.320]   which was of course the salesman and that was created by uh an iranian born uh director
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:14.200]   asgar ferrod who decided not to come to the us to in case of to accept his award because he was a
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.640]   you know because of the immigration ban he was unhappy about that so he nominated the first
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.680]   iranian in space annusha and saar to read his statement
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:30.680]   um and his absence he said is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.400]   other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:43.640]   to the us so little political commentary there well and a celebrity award show what
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:51.320]   what a shocker and netflix also won for uh uh the white helmets which is a short subject
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.480]   documentary about uh seria
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:36:02.840]   but i love jimmy kimmels line uh during the askers he said well i'll let him
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:08.360]   amazon is represented at the academy and works amazon is the first pre-mister
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:13.400]   that's nominated for best picture jim pesos is the founder and co and i want to say congratulations
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:18.280]   to jeff you know i also want you know jeff if you win tonight you could expect your
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.600]   oscar to arrive in two to five business days
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:28.360]   possibly stolen by a group pump delivery man and jeff is there and is uh
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:33.400]   his little surprise you couldn't hear the laugh all the way i know i know jeff's honking laugh
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:40.360]   so so this amazon refuses to hand over data on whether it's got overheard or murder
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.120]   what do we think about that we talked about that a while back is the one in the
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:52.840]   yeah yeah the hot tub murders all right that's what i was uh i'm grateful still a reporter i
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:58.120]   could tell you've worked the crime beat no this is new new news on this we did talk a little bit
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:05.000]   amazon is refusing yeah amazon says the there's a first amendment right in this they're afraid of
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.440]   a chill on using uh scullum right people won't speak to their scholar they also well they also
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:18.440]   argue that the fishing expedition yeah the data they don't need this they're it sounds like they're
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.720]   trying to figure out if the voices match the guy the like who was in the home at the time
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:29.080]   oh i said but i mean what is the chance if you're going to murder somebody that oh by the way i'm
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.960]   gonna have echo play some nice music well well so they were heavy so they were having
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:39.640]   like party and drinking in the hot tub so i can see maybe they were like they were completely
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:46.200]   trash this is not a premeditated murder but the other thing in this case that was worth noting is
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:53.160]   they police were very savvy they actually pulled data from their water meter right to
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:59.480]   they showed that he was excessive water use in the middle of the night to clean up the crime scene
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:05.080]   well that's their theory we don't guess yes to allegedly clean up the crime scene
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:13.240]   allegedly amazon also had a uh documentary that james ballman documentary i'm not your niega that
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:19.240]   was nominated but lost to oj i mean that tells you something right there that was really powerful
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.440]   though if you saw it oj made in america or i'm not your niega i am not your niega i know i really
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:30.040]   want to see that yeah you don't don't put it off is like i don't know if i'm ready for this viewing
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:35.400]   just just do it i've seen clips of it it's yeah yeah balled one's amazing really amazing
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:45.640]   was amazing i was about to say um hey he's not like uh yeah fredder delix is back right
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:52.600]   let's see what else so we have video a robot video we have two robot oh yeah when i showed
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.680]   this robot video before but i guess it was the leaked video this is the official one
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.080]   it's a long it's longer and then we also have a pizza robot
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:11.880]   now we're talking so this is the handle robot um so we have this is this is boston dynamics
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:17.160]   did are they still a google company or not the i was the same thing they have not been sold yet
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:21.320]   okay so i thought c_n_ got this wrong because google bought them and then
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.920]   said oh but they're going to stop their uh defense department contracts and then they
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:31.640]   couldn't or didn't and then google said all right well we're gonna last march they've asked
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.720]   from the market rumors were there would be a sold to toyota but that as a last made i
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.320]   didn't have the i looked this up before because i thought c_n_ was wrong on this and i actually
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.440]   looked at first before i yeah sure well and i reporting and as we've said a bit before i mean i
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:48.680]   think google is probably smart and not getting involved with killer robots at the moment
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:55.800]   yeah well that that conflicts with the do no evil well it doesn't have to be a killer they can
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.600]   also be for search and rescue have you seen those robots well look it's called handle and here's
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:06.520]   the official video not the leaked video it's a robot on wheels so we've seen the dog remember
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:11.800]   the dog and then remember the bipedal robot that they kept pushing over and there it is in the
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:18.840]   background in fact handles fast imagine it come for you and then beating your skull in with those
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:26.520]   we we know what you know we would remake 1980 was it a hey for the other rats in the box uh it was
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.480]   tasty we just put her in a box with robots yeah i did ask for someone i wanted someone to photoshop
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.440]   a like an ice figure skating like this robot doing figure skating because that's what this looks
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.760]   like it does doesn't it and i thought they look at it busy here right i i had to reward
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:46.520]   my think it's gonna get dizziness it can look at that oh man it can handle uneven surfaces it can
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:54.680]   jump four feet in the air straight up uh it has endpoint control okay well there you go i mean
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:00.680]   now notice it's tethered right now i don't know why it's tethered just put it and then it's gonna
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:07.720]   pick up a hundred pounds as if it weighed nothing somebody said this it looks just like robo cop
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.640]   and you know what happened robo cop this this is scary no
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:19.000]   it's snowy and wet out but does that stop no handle does not stop
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.080]   i am feel sorry for the people who have office space next to boston dynamics because they keep
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.760]   running these robots out to the parking lot here's the jump four feet straight up
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:35.720]   could play pick imagine it playing ping pong and getting angry and jumping over your table
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:43.400]   there you go again terrifying yeah well then then will you will stay seen will you order a robot
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:52.440]   made pizza up yeah you know i would even know that story Leo made by a pizza uh i mean
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:57.960]   may sorry i thought you said a robot made by a pizza but you go to the next the other way around
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:04.120]   yeah i got i got the video it's loading up here this is a pizza made by a robot well that's just
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:11.320]   like an assembly line come on exactly as old as it's cheating you know there's a gynecologist robot
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:18.440]   and i think that's probably a better question where is it do it it does it help exams so i think
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:25.400]   a pizza made by a team i'm sorry is that for people who are really shy i think it's just to like
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:33.320]   optimize health care delivery kind of robot about being dehumanized yeah this robot
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:40.040]   is not a surgery surgery i understand i've had i've had that surgery yeah this is a cool looking robot
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:46.280]   too it's the debate when i came into the o-r with a robot that did my prostate surgery it's much
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:52.520]   taller than you think you kind of look up and salute it and say don't screw up so you had uh what kind
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:59.240]   of surgery did you have i had a prostateectomy and then i uh and do is he or doctor or yeah the
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:06.680]   doctor's over at a console wow yeah so this is minimally invasive robotic
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:11.720]   surgery oh here's a picture i don't know if i can get a video for you but here's a picture
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:17.640]   that would i don't i wouldn't want to is that what yours look like yeah yeah that's terrifying
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:25.080]   what's it called divinci vinci vinci vinci what's so this is the one you had yeah what's the
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.200]   advantage is you still need a doctor
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:36.360]   it can get into places and he's looking at the view through the laparoscop laparoscope or whatever
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:41.560]   yeah so it's just it's it's it's a next step of laparoscopic surgery that's kind of i bet you
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:47.880]   could probably can you clean these easier too than people i don't know you can't i'm just i'm curious
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:54.040]   you can't steam clean people how about pizza huts smart shoes that will order a pizza for you
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:44:03.480]   wait the shoes why what what is happening in our world people are lazy this is a 30 second

[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:22.680]   yelling at his driver who had the temerity a claim i thought it was gonna be worse than what it was
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:27.240]   you know this is part of the problem with having a founder that's so closely conflated with the
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:34.280]   business and i mean for better or worse if your founder's a jerk i mean ohm for example was
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.080]   conflated with gig ohm but ohm happened to be a stand-up stellar fellow so don't name your company
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:45.880]   after yourself that's for sure that is for sure uh caloneck would look like a little order a caloneck
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:52.520]   oh and i want to correct uh chris asad tweeted me and he said i wasn't come i twisted chris i
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:46:00.760]   said last week um had said uh that something about the fowler article but in fact he wasn't talking
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:08.600]   about the fowler article he what was he was uh now i've forgotten he's lost me entirely i don't
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.800]   know what you're talking about whatever was you guys don't you definitely don't
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:18.120]   uh um was it this show yeah it was on this show we were talking about susan fowler's article about
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:24.120]   uh uber right okay was that not on this show maybe it was on some other show we did no we talked
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:32.520]   about it yeah and uh sod had uh posted on facebook i think you know that he that he he was upset about
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:39.960]   kara swisshers take on it not the fowler article original oh i see sad is works at uber he's
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.760]   a head of developer platform at uber so and a listener apparently so i apologize chris
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:52.920]   uh he was not complaining about the fowler article but about kara swisshers piece and you
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:59.160]   probably wouldn't be alone in that regard i i like kara but she can she can definitely
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.840]   she's as bad as jeff when it comes to getting cranky hey hey hey
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:12.200]   so she's she's better at being frank she's she's a wonderer i love she's really in a found here
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:16.040]   frankly but you know what i want for you to want i want from kara what i want a weekly political
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:21.000]   podcast from kara well she does already does a recode a show but you're right but not a political
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.080]   i want her to do a political rant even just 30 seconds a week i would kill for that
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:34.760]   that really who ways you kill she also wrote about amit sanghal who was a google engineer
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.040]   remember went to google as uh uber's a senior vice president of engineering
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:45.480]   uber said we didn't know i don't think anybody knew that sanghal had been apparently had been
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:52.520]   fired at google over sexual harassment he left uh as under a cloud yes he left under a cloud he
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.160]   wasn't fired he wasn't fired he left under a cloud according to kara female employee
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:03.720]   file a sexual harassment complaint against him in 2015 google later allowed sanghal to leave
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:10.440]   before the company could take further action sanghal denies the allegations but he has stepped
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.360]   down at uber
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:21.480]   uber's i would imagine very sensitive these days about those kinds of stories
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:33.000]   did you read about the border patrol agent who asks uh asked a software engineer to prove that
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.520]   he was a software engineer by balancing a b-tree selestine omen is a 28 year old software engineer
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:46.280]   from lagos nigeria he was traveling to us on sunday as part of his job with andela which is a startup
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.320]   uh actually mark zuckerberg uh and prozilla channer and investors upon arrival at jfk was
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.800]   questioned by a border agent waited for an hour then was brought to a different room to be questioned
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.640]   by a second agent he wrote on linkedin quote your visa says you're a software engineer is that
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.760]   correct the officer asked omena natoen the engineer described his accusatory when omen said it was
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:14.600]   right the officer presented him with a piece of paper and a pen and told him to answer the following
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:21.960]   questions write a function to check if a binary search tree is balanced and what is an abstract
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:27.640]   class and why do you need it to omen who had had not slept in more than 24 hours the questions
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:32.040]   seemed opaque and could have multiple answers while he's a skilled software engineer with more
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.200]   than seven years of experience he later said the questions looked to him like someone with no
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:42.520]   technical background googled something like questions to ask a software engineer he did his
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:47.240]   best to answer the questions and after first being told he flunked the plot pop quiz was
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.520]   nevertheless allowed to go presumably because in the meantime omen's employer had been contacted
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:58.120]   and vouched for him and we all probably saw the tweet which was retweeted thousands of times
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:03.480]   i was just asked to balance a binary search tree by jf kara's airport immigration welcome to america
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.040]   i thought it was a joke yeah you know i've been talking to lots of people who've been coming
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:13.160]   across the border people you know from ireland people from england people from germany
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:21.880]   all getting more hassle all yeah are they are are any of them white yes they're all okay they're
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:28.760]   just there's just ferners ferners are getting hassled period i think it's more ferners not just
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:34.680]   it's been hot you know this is not ever since 9/11 it's been a little bit more difficult i mean i
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.840]   i've i remember you know friends people like will harris complaining he's a brit
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:43.800]   you know you had to get hit people entering the u_s have to submit fingerprints it's
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:49.400]   answered tough questions and uh and then it goes the other way i think the canadian border patrol
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:54.760]   started doing similar things to america's and in a canada almost as in retaliation this they have a
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:01.160]   broad right to do this and and uh a lot of discretion but that also speaks for our country and it's
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:06.200]   shameful what they're doing people who are friends and our relatives and our co-workers who want to
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:11.480]   just come to our country well it's a little they're doing it to people who like our citizens of our
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:18.040]   country too if they look the wrong way and that's that's frustrating for my friends because that's
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:24.520]   not cool well there are a lot of stories there's the the woman who was coming uh where was she from
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:30.120]   ireland to speak at a conference in houston and was detained at the airport almost turned back
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:35.400]   uh who she says i'm never coming to come there well there's a beloved uh australian
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:39.960]   australian writer that's who it was australia yeah she said and then there was an ex a holocaust
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:48.520]   expert who was almost turned back from the conference all right let's uh take a break and get your
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:56.840]   picks of the week what do you say yep okay sure okay seems about that time you know what this is my
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:04.920]   friends this my friends is the answer to all your Wi-Fi problems did is here is the ear-o
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:13.000]   why just settle for a dumb old Wi-Fi router that's so 20th century when you can join the cool kids
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:19.800]   who are using mesh routers and these look good these are beautiful ear-o was it's actually a year
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:28.600]   old can you believe this happy one ear-o birthday to er o the original whole home Wi-Fi system
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:35.240]   it's a mesh system that blankets your entire house a fast reliable Wi-Fi no more buffering no
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:42.840]   more dead zones Wi-Fi that just works see what happened was Wi-Fi was wildly successful and suddenly
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:48.360]   even if you lived in a relatively you know remote area there were lots of Wi-Fi signals all over
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:54.440]   your house lots of congestion houses got bigger we demanded more bandwidth and pretty soon this
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:53:00.600]   you know Wi-Fi router you'd been using just wasn't good enough ear-o created this notion of mesh
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:07.160]   routers multiple routers communicating rapidly with one another so unlike an extender they don't
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:12.440]   have the bandwidth they give you full bandwidth throughout your entire house each ear-o unit does
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:17.960]   about 1500 square feet so these three units would do 4500 square feet and i'll vouch for that that's
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.880]   about it's a bit a little bigger than our house but we will use three units to cover the entire
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:28.600]   house easily what's also great about the ear-o they're overbuilt and i did not know this maybe
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:33.160]   you didn't either stacy i know you're kind of an expert on this stuff but they put more processor
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:39.480]   and more memory in the ear-o than they needed because they wanted to be able to push software
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:45.640]   updates in fact they pushed their most recent one the 2.0 mesh update big big update and there's more
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:51.720]   capability there they also automatically upgrade the firmware so it's one of the you know key
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:58.760]   ingredients of any iot device is that it'd be a patchable for security issues and the ear-o is
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:05.240]   absolutely absolutely up to date protected with state of the art wpa2 encryption of course and
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:09.960]   there's features in the ear-o app that are very sophisticated it kind of hides the complexity
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.040]   makes it easy to set up but if you want to dig down into the app there's some stuff you can do
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:21.640]   that are is really high-end check it out on amazon great reviews 100 750 of them
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:25.960]   there's a one-year warranty it works with your existing modem and internet service
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:32.760]   and there's of course a 30-day money back guarantee ear-o the original whole home wi-fi system
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.880]   to celebrate its first birthday they've permanently lowered the prices for ear-o
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:44.440]   you can get the three-pack and again that's about 4500 square feet for $3.99 that's $100 off
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.920]   two-pack enough for 3,000 square feet most homes that be plenty
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:57.800]   $2.99 $50 off go to ero.com or best buy or amazon and never again
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:05.400]   this is why i had to go to the ear-o will you hear honey the wi-fi is not working
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:17.320]   i can't watch the tv what's going on fix it fix it right but i fixed it no complaints
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:25.000]   e-e-r-o dot com we thank them for not only the support of this week at google but for
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.560]   saving my marriage
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:35.400]   uh well then let's see here why don't we start with stacy's pick i'm sure you've got something
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:41.640]   exciting and fabulous for us oh i wish i have like so many devices that are like on route so
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:46.120]   and get excited about what are you most excited about that you haven't seen yet
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:57.880]   oh oh oh you guys they're like oh i just doorbell you won't believe it it's amazing no there is a
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.120]   device called so i'm as excited about this the review unit's not coming out though so i can't
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:10.120]   tell you like if it's any good or not but it's called the bond and it is an ir and a rf
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:18.840]   device the reason i'm excited about it is because it's $99 and it is going to be able to do
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:24.360]   with the the ir it can control a bunch of different devices like air conditioners and
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:30.600]   so it's an ir blaster well it's not just an ira blaster you just plug this in somewhere in
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.480]   your house and then you can also tie in like i'm excited about it because i've got these
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:41.720]   samphi motorized blinds and it's going to work with those according to the company
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:48.120]   and to set it up instead of doing this crazy and sane z-wave setup that i do right now
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:54.040]   which sucks and it takes a long time i'm going to be able to just point my remote at this blaster
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.640]   thing basically in the app and it's going to automatically add it so it's going to be a lot
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:04.760]   easier to add my devices so you just do it with ceiling fans yes and it's got the echo
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:08.840]   so now if you do it with like if you have a remote that controls your ceiling fan
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:14.440]   you can actually program the bond to that and then use it to open your ceiling or to
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:19.800]   turn on your ceiling fan with your voice with your voice wow you can also use an app but i'm
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.200]   i'm anti-app because i hate pulling out my phone yeah no i'm pretty i think the i think the
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:31.240]   amazon echo is actually the killer application for iot frankly so that's what i like i this is
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:36.840]   going to be my device if it works whenever it arrives probably because i am super stoked about
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:45.320]   it and there you see it ladies and gentlemen the the perilous roller coaster ride between high hopes
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:52.520]   and dash toeps that every iot device goes through speaking of dash toeps guys i got my logitech
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:58:00.840]   harmony working oh it was some weird confluence of events oh good so we're all good and
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:08.280]   you're husband don't even know you my husband is now speaking to me and he admits that i might
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.960]   have been worth it to pay ninety nine dollars for voice control of our television now i'm gonna
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.840]   get back to mind because i was waiting to see if you were able to get it working i yeah and
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:23.880]   and i hooked it up to my string of fire count guys and i'm playing with some recipes i love
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:31.320]   stratify that was a great pick thank you no problem yeah thank you so uh okay well that's good enough
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:37.080]   for a pick you do you're not picking it but you're excited to be getting it i'm like sorry you guys
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:41.800]   there's gonna be a bunch of stuff coming in the next couple weeks oh no no apologize i like it bond
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:51.720]   home.io available for pre-order not ninety nine dollars jeff i'm sure i saw i saw a good number but
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:58.440]   i'm curious if i have lots of numbers first i want to mention something if i may yes the uh the
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:03.320]   the first draft coalition which is a wonderful organization working on more facts in news
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:10.680]   together with news organizations and others backed by google i think facebook too has launched
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:17.400]   cross check in france to uh uh check on on on the news in their election so i just wanted to mention
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:24.920]   that as a as a uh bit of a pawn this is a fake news not my number per ton. So when is the election is
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:34.200]   it soon? Yes so then germany after that is marie pen a front runner or it at for a plurality yes
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:45.640]   okay guessing is it in the runoff she would suffer but oh no no no no no you're here builders and
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:51.800]   the other ones is also uh is this similar politicians thoughts going on so anyway so yeah lots a lot
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:58.200]   i got lots of numbers here um what i probably like is that google now says that we watch one
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:03.560]   billion hours of youtube a day which is ten times more than netflix though netflix makes plenty of
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:09.560]   money in their way and is approaching the 1.2 billion hours of television we watch in a day
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:17.880]   1 billion hours of youtube 2 billion number a us only number or is that newlson data shows 1.25
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:26.600]   billion tv u.s america yes so why is the youtube number 1 billion global that's a good question yes
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:32.200]   i'll bet you're right but it is approaching tv if you click on the link at the top there that's uh
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.960]   that's the blog post in google but even the number is one billion hours watch i mean it makes me think
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:46.760]   of how much server and bandwidth are you voting to youtube i mean that's that's how many petabytes
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:55.400]   of data a day is that i don't know if it's a billion hours and an hour of youtube streaming is
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:03.240]   probably let's let's be generous an hour of hd streaming is about seven gigabytes two oh wow oh
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:11.320]   sorry an hour of h no an hour of hd streaming or 4k hd is about two so let's say one just to be
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:19.640]   generous because not everybody's watching an hd okay so that's one gigabyte times one billion
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:25.640]   which gets us what's is that a petabyte billion gigabytes i think a billion gigabytes is that a
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:33.320]   petabyte or is that a bite help me google convert well let's just google it a billion gigabytes is
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:39.480]   an exabyte no exabyte yeah it's an exabyte you wanted a number of the day man you got a number
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:50.040]   x an exabyte of data a day that isn't even imaginable i think sisco imagined it and there were there's
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:55.640]   data duties internet so you get you know you get megabyte and a thousand megabytes is a gigabyte
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:02.200]   a thousand gigabytes is a terabyte a thousand terabytes is a petabyte a thousand petabytes is an
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:10.280]   exabyte then there's zeta and yada someday we'll get we'll get a yada bite of data out of youtube
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.800]   yada yada yada yada yada yada wow an exabyte of data a day that is a number jeff
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.520]   it is what was the number you saw you like that was the one i thought i was wondering if you
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.200]   okay if you would mention that i thought that was a really good number jeff some others if you want
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:30.520]   to oh you want something um i like this story which is a huge story that was just just broke
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:36.120]   yes they've found you even know what i'm talking about they have found what they believe are fossils
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:41.560]   of some of the earliest living organisms on earth and if you believe earth is six thousand years
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:47.800]   yes they were tardigrades if you believe earth is six thousand years old just plug your ears right
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:54.760]   now tiny filaments knobs and tubes and canadian rock stated to be four point two eight billion
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:00.520]   years old that's not much much younger than the earth itself and
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:07.000]   stretches the number the previous number by several hundred million years so if it makes
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.320]   you think that life is less a fluke than something that comes along with those planets recently
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:16.600]   discovered you wonder whether they're we had a great interview on saturday on the new screensavers
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:23.400]   with one of the planetary scientists a three p h d guy oh wow who was involved in that and uh
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:31.480]   he said that there's uh another story help me out here um another uh research project being done
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:41.080]   to take the basic chemicals early planetary chemicals and combine them and there is strong
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:46.040]   evidence they haven't written the paper up yet but i got them pressure from him he has an inside
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:54.600]   track on this that they were able to create uh RNA just by combining these these elements
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:04:02.280]   that it that if that were the case and we've now found these these earth-like planets including
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.360]   three planets that are in the goldilocks zone in this in this new star that are you know in other
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:12.360]   words where lifelike as we know it could exist plenty of water which is also a condition and
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:20.760]   these scientists can show that the the actual creation of replicating life from basic chemicals
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:27.640]   is possible through a lightning strike or some other addition of energy then it would he it was
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:32.520]   his opinion that it answers the question not only aren't we not alone but that life is probably
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:40.360]   very common in the universe it was a very i strongly suggest you uh listen to that interview on uh
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:46.120]   the new series on saturday it was it was chilling it was fascinating so i asked about fermi's paradox
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:51.640]   i said well why have if life is common because there's billions and billions of galaxies each with
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:57.640]   billions of stars if life is and if there's many many planets there might be you know an exabyte
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:03.960]   of planets out there if uh life is common why haven't he heard from anybody and he said well it might
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:09.560]   be common but it's also easy to wipe out and he said getting to the level of civilization we're at
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:15.800]   we're talking about life like us like this kind of life single-celled you know filament uh for life
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:20.840]   to get to the point where it could travel through space or communicate through space that's a lot harder
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:26.360]   or you know it in in in the science fiction world it could have occurred but it'll
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:33.160]   be a galaxy long long ago and far far away yeah so i don't have a pick but i do have a picture
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:40.520]   you know uh when you do a reddit ask me anything an ama on reddit you're required to submit a photo
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:46.600]   proving that you are you bill gates recently did an ama on reddit this is the photo he submitted
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:53.560]   it's so great to prove his identity i don't know what it means oh it's david as pumpkins
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:59.560]   try to describe those to the listening audience well so he's wearing a suit a made of christmas
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:04.360]   trees it's obviously his christmas suit not made of christmas trees but it's a patchwork quilt with
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:09.720]   christmas tree images uh on it he's holding up a sign of course saying this is bill gates and then
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.760]   there's he's flanked by uh two strangely clad creatures they look like dr sous creatures with
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:21.640]   fuzzy hair black polka dots white kind of spandex outfits and gloves and their makeup is very scary
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:26.040]   they're white face with black rings around their eyes and black lipstick what are they
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:32.760]   it's so if you go to google david s pumpkins on saturday nightlife this is what this is except

[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:12.360]   that's bill gates the third richest man in the world maybe the second
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:17.320]   yes if you're the second richest man in the world
