[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.520]   It's the fifth time I started the show, but we're gonna go this is a keeper this one
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.640]   This is a keeper. This is what podcasting is all about humanity man. I
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   Didn't get my hair done for this show. I'm not wearing any makeup
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.040]   Clearly Jeff Jarvis and I hope is wearing pants, but his makeup. I don't know you look normal
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.640]   Why oh I can't oh it's bizarre
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.680]   Jeff Jarvis
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.200]   We got Trump's treatment for the skin
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.880]   Do you think he does I'm just a completely a side note
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.560]   Do you think he does a spray on or does he does he have a bottle spray spray on do you think they have installed in the White House?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.880]   sprayers a boost that's a that's Matthew Ingram. He's chief digital writer at Columbia journalism review CJR.org
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.960]   Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.120]   You know blah blah blah town night
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.000]   University of New York. Thank you and buzz machine calm is his blog
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   CJR.org is Matthews outlet
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.480]   I think it's kind of interesting, you know Nixon put in a bowling alley covering up JFK's pool
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.000]   Mm-hmm because JFK had a pool because of his bad back. He would swim. He also liked bringing young ladies down there's it turned out
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.880]   Nixon
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.120]   Maybe he also dated. I don't know but he had a bowling alley put in on top of it. Well, I would be a Nixon date wouldn't it?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   Yeah, let's go bowling and
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   Would it be ironic if that's where the spray tan boost is now. Oh, oh, yeah
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.760]   I think it's actually where the pressure is. Oh, yeah, I'm picturing I'm picturing like a one of those hazmat
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.680]   You know spray down things from when you come in chemically contaminated except all the sprays are tan the place
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.440]   I go to get my my nails and face done
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.520]   Just a sense. Oh do tell us more. You don't expect me to so they she says I can set up. I have a portable
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   tanning thing
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.560]   Really she sets it up. Yeah, cuz it cuz it is like an airbrush
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah, and so it's all over. You're basically spray painting you pretty painting. Yeah, and so and I think you stripped down
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.680]   And I would hope so and she sprays you. Yeah, you don't want to do it with your clothes on
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.400]   Well when I when they brought HD TV to TV
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.440]   Then I would go on CNN or MSNBC
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.760]   They've stopped doing this. Oh, yeah, they're airbrushed. Yeah, yeah, they used to do a memory
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.600]   It was a huge thing. I remember writing about it a bunch of networks had to like completely reduce sets
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   Yeah, and makeup because you could see all the tape and the paint and they abandoned it, right Jeff
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.800]   They don't do that. Yes, they don't do it anymore. I always wonder what about Peter inhaled. I crap
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.480]   Well, it's literally the same thing if you've ever used a compressor based airbrush for painting
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's exactly same. It's even got a little thing
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.640]   When I used to do live with Kelly Regis and Kelly they would they for couple
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.000]   Just like what you said when he first came out they tried it and then yeah, it stopped
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.560]   I used to do hits on the business at work and I would forget to take the makeup off
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.360]   And then I would take the subway home or something in Empire. Yeah, people would look at me like
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.880]   What is going on there? I finally look normal. Yeah
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   That's why I was wondering if you were in makeup. Yeah, that's that's so you're suspiciously colored neither nobody
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.120]   It's good. We've been able to do shows all week. I thought always could be hard. Everybody's gonna be at CES
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.880]   We've only missed one person that's Stacy. She went to CES this year poor woman
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.600]   You miss CES anyway
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   every I was telling
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.460]   Paul throughout Mary Joe Foley this earlier every
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.040]   December I say to Lisa oh man, we should
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   Go to CES and she always goes no
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.760]   and
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.320]   This has been true last few years this year particularly I look at the offerings and think oh my god
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.640]   I'm so glad it didn't go but you could ride the Google ride. Yeah. Oh, yeah. What is that? It's like
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.440]   It's on the rundown it is the dumbest thing it is like
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.640]   It's a small small world after all level of irritation. Yeah, what's about Google?
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.440]   Is it a is it a so seen it?
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.320]   videoed it and
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.260]   Let me see if we can you've seen all the best parts already you got a fast forward
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.960]   Or a huge building at CES 19 this year three times bigger
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.560]   This is Todd
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.960]   Hassell to Hazelton and they even have a roller coaster more like a track ride behind me. We're gonna go ride it now
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.920]   Okay, let's go so there's a little a little
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.200]   This is it how exciting can you be there's a little track in a little car?
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.800]   That the guy was oops, he's not supposed to be there. Okay run away. He broke the wall
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.320]   Get out of the shot. What's the noise?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.120]   Each thing you go by as a family doing today you can ask Google assistance
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.800]   Like a lot of the signs are going through say like Google off the front door Google open the blind
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.560]   All the partner brother. Oh my god. How much money do they spend? Oh
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.480]   This is a really good example of
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.560]   Somebody in a meeting suggested it everybody thought I was a great idea
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:11.200]   They have too much money and they just did it and that's it. No, no sainer head prevailed as as a shareholder
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   I'm not happy about this
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.400]   Okay, let me argue the other side. I mean is it possible that
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.560]   Any of the people going on that ride didn't know all the things Google assistant did
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   Well, they announced all this gets into our show they announced all kinds of
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.800]   Yes, and and for example a whole bunch of new
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:41.880]   Translation stuff where you're gonna be able to talk to you to the assistant with someone else in the room who has the different language
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.800]   You know what and you communicate play the changelog music
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.680]   We might as well just go into the changelog because this is all new stuff from Google
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:08:01.440]   Google made at least one dozen announcements. Here's the verges to see this is why I don't need to go
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.760]   Because everybody and their brothers they are writing this out and it's much easier
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.720]   They don't mess up their feet walking all over God's house Baker getting that's lots of
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.080]   third-party integration integration with dishes Hopper
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.000]   Sonos speakers finally that's great. They've had Amazon's echo for a while, but Sonos has always said, you know, we're gonna be
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.240]   Assistant agnostic a KitchenAid smart display. We already have the home hub and
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.000]   LG and
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.400]   Who is JBL have smart displays Vegas KitchenAid is getting in the act Samsung TV integration actually that was interesting because Samsung's not only putting
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.920]   Google in their TVs are putting
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.960]   Apple's iTunes and Airplay 2
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.800]   So that used to be you know a walled garden is kind of maybe not better Philips Hue integration
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:59.000]   I actually use use my assistant. I say turn the lights off and it doesn't so I don't know what better integration means
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.400]   car products like lighter adapters
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   This is an anchor anchor has a
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:12.120]   Lighter adapter that I had theirs and still do the Viva which was Amazon's echo last year
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.240]   This year they put a Google assistant in it, which I think is actually a good idea. I'll look for you
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.480]   Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:31.040]   Earlier this week Amazon said we were on a hundred million devices. So Google had to say well, we're on a billion devices
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.920]   But Google has a slight advantage because most of those billion devices are phones
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   They're in a lot of they're in all Android phones almost
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.240]   So all right, so that's that's new. Let's see what else here
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:51.440]   There are a bunch of new software features you can do your boarding passes on assistant I
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.800]   Guess I don't just understand how wonderful it is, but they well
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.360]   Can you say to the assistant show me my boarding pass? Yeah, it's on the screen before that it will take you through the whole process
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.800]   Oh, yeah, so you know, I had I don't have luggage. Yes, I knowledge. I'm not taking on bombs
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   You can do whatever
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.320]   And now you can do my voice
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:22.220]   So I'm reading I'm reading odd things because my Gutenberg moment. I'm now reading a 1960s book from script
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.520]   print
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.320]   The world of readers and writers as it was before the common existence of printed books. Oh god, Jarvis
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.440]   Please know I'm going the other way. I'm going from print to script
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.960]   So, you know, I feel like it's my about as part of my retreat from the 21st century is all found you are good nuts
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.760]   Yes, what kind of pen?
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.080]   Well, oh don't get me started. Oh, well, you're not getting all that are you I realize I don't know
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.600]   It's a little Freudian, but right around adolescence. I started to get involved with pens and
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   I remember those young man. Yeah, well I
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   Remember going to the Brown University bookstore and I would you know
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.840]   Buy pens and I've owned many a month long owned and lost many a month block in my time
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:17.740]   But now that I'm older wiser and perhaps more responsible. I've decided to kind of beef up my pen collection
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.760]   This is a Japanese
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.040]   Inexpensive Japanese brand called sailor that people
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.920]   I'm cutting the reddit
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.960]   subreddit for fountain pens so stop me at any time
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.600]   It's wanted for its nib. They say it's a very good, you know, the nib is the most
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:42.400]   Huge somebody said and I think this is very apt really writing with a fountain pen a fountain pen is just a controlled ink leak
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:50.120]   Yeah, that's basically what's happening. Yeah, and the nib is where the ink leaks out of so how the nib works with how it writes with its scratch
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.600]   You got a bad nib. It's terrible. Oh, it's could be the worst. So you're a fountain pen aficionado as well
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.160]   Yeah, I had a whole bunch of them
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.600]   actually had still have one that doesn't really work it was my
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.680]   Great grandmother's I think so it's got a bladder in it and
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.640]   Lift a little lever
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.400]   No, see I've decided I'm never buying a pen that doesn't have a
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.680]   Built-in converter. I don't like the cartridges, which is what the sailor uses or the aftermarket converters
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.520]   So I I've ordered a pelican and I'm waiting for it that has a pelican has a patented
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.920]   special system and I also have a winged song the Chinese
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:37.840]   Makes sense very big and fountain pen. So I have a winged song 698, which I like a lot. I like gel Jeff
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.200]   gel
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.520]   No, it's not a technology advanced. No aesthetic. No, it's good
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.080]   No, I used to do calligraphy as well. So I got heavily into those types of pens
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:55.600]   You need you need a fountain pen to because the width of the line varies which which it doesn't do with a gel pen
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.280]   You can also and by the way, it doesn't end with the pen. There's a huge
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:08.000]   Thing of ink now. This is something that's changed in the last few years at least since I was into it
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.680]   Where there's luminescent inks all kinds of inks ladies and gentlemen welcome to this weekend 1398. I like going back in time
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:22.280]   So there's a there's a brand that I'm a fan of called noodlers
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:30.360]   Noodlers ink and they make a variety of inks with the political messages including the Bernanke black
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.840]   That is fast drying because when you're printing money, it's important
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   and dry fast
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.640]   They have such great while so I'm gonna I'm gonna say and they're in there very
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:52.160]   Here's pastr neck. They have a Russian series now. You have got you. I'm blaming you for this Matthew. I'm down the rabbit hole
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.720]   the reason I got Bernanke though is because I'm a lefty and
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.640]   If you're left, yes, you don't found answer. You don't smear it. Yeah, I have in the past
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   Been not you know a good
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.440]   Penman as they call them
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:17.160]   Because of my left handiness and I just just drug it so Bernanke is gonna be my life saver because it dries before you get your hand fascinating
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.320]   Fasten it as well. Yeah, I have some really nice gels
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.320]   You know what I like on the gel side
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.720]   The Baron fig are you know about you know about the Baron fig? No, I just have
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.640]   Ener gel
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.640]   Sounds like a dessert Baron fig should be a dessert
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.680]   the Baron fig
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.600]   This is the squire is the best roller bar all you can get and I even have a squire
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:50.320]   That has a little stand that I keep on my desk here Wow. This is Jeff
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.800]   It's not expensive. Well, it is stand. Why do you need to stand because then you just put it in the stand?
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.680]   And it's always there and ready for you. You can go get you on. It's on my desk. Okay
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.440]   These are these are the best roller balls Jeff if you want to really have fun
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.960]   very big Aaron fig squire and then the idea why it's called that I
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   Just love the name and then if you want a disposable Schneider
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.520]   And I've tried my but I used to be a pilot guy pilot gel. Yeah pilots are pretty very good
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.320]   But I have these Baron fig you've never seen okay the pen tells my favorite pen tells are good too
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.720]   Intel energy
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.560]   Well as we were saying about Google I can't escape
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.520]   one last
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.720]   That I can't escape though the notion that this is all extremely Freudian
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.440]   There's something just wrong
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.400]   Sometimes a pen is just a pen sometimes a pen is just a writing instrument. Here's my Baron fig
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.440]   You see that and then it's wow always available
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.640]   Wow nice nicely weighted little stand. What if you want to carry it with you?
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:00.680]   It will retract or does retract yeah, but you don't need to retract it if you keep it in the patented Baron fig stand
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.120]   You pay extra for the stand
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.960]   How much for that whole package
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.680]   Think 55 bucks, but it comes with a bunch of refills. Oh
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.920]   This is the last a lifetime. It's a writing instrument. It's not a pen
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:23.400]   You can also play Dixie on it. I do think there is something attached to the fact that I've withdrawn from social media
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.040]   Oh, yes, this is definitely and then I'm going into pens and you're gonna be on the goddamn paleo diet
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.120]   We know oh that too you have one of those
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.680]   Do you have a manual keyboard for your tablet or anything like that?
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.360]   I've been looking for those. There's some pretty good ones out there
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.120]   So it's basically like an old fashioned
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.920]   Yeah, the quirky yeah quirky. Yeah, I actually made the quirky guy cry
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.680]   We we had a show
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.760]   Called I'd fund that in
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.400]   Which people came in
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.480]   Was it quirky USB keyboard? Let me quirky was so I did quirky
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.840]   I went to the quirky judgings and was a judge a couple times
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.320]   They were so great. Yeah, it wasn't quirky quirky was as gone now. Yeah
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.880]   Yeah sad to say because I thought that was a really good idea
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.400]   Yeah, the quirky writer. It's QW er k y
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.440]   Okay, so they were they were at this point trying to raise money on Kickstarter
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.360]   And so we had them on I'd fund that and if it was basically shark tank if we liked it
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.240]   We'd say I would fund that if we didn't like it. I would say go fund yourself
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.120]   And and I looked at this because what do I know and I said wait a minute
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.600]   You're gonna have this typewriter keyboard. It's a hundred some dollars
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.320]   You're gonna have this typewriter keyboard people are gonna buy it and use it two hundred forty nine dollars
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:57.120]   I said you're insane go fund yourself and I was wrong. I love it. I love it. I've almost bought one
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:22.120]   I was so wrong. It even has a little what do they call that? Yeah, I mean carri
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.720]   Olympus so Jeff in the lobby. I don't know if you've been there Matthew
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:33.280]   But if in the lobby of CUNY's journalism school they have an exhibit of typewriters old typewriters. It's really cool
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   in the old I have my basement
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.480]   My favorite one my favorite old writer
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:46.580]   The brand is Bing Bing Bing I tell everybody that's where Microsoft searches I see you have a machine that goes
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.240]   I had a typewriter fetish for a time as well
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.640]   Yeah, I think I think lots of people do I love them. I love them
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.720]   There's a book that came out last year called the Chinese typewriter. Did you hear about that?
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.640]   Well, that's crazy because I don't have a Roman pastor said it's not 20
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:11.080]   So the book is about this guy's sort of mission to create a Chinese typewriter
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.560]   Which ultimately fails. I think there was one, but I don't know that any
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.520]   copies of it exist anymore, but one was built allegedly and it had
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.480]   You know a 15 stage shift key I think
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:32.880]   And it's just fascinating but this story of sort of trying to come up with one and how
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.960]   difficult it was to get kind of
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.920]   So before we were processing how this is really eager to me. How did one do documents?
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   Well, there were these things called fountain pens
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   We've come full circle now
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:53.120]   That's the other thing I've gotten into because I because I really as a lefty
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.200]   I know how terrible handwriting and I was taught the Palmer method in school and now they do it as an even simplified Palmer method
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.720]   But the Palmer method was a simple life-eyed version of something called
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:09.480]   Spenserian script and there's a company named Mott books that publishes the workbooks for the original
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.800]   Spenserian script as taught in schools in the 19th century
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:21.640]   And nice and I've purchased all of those workbooks and I'm working my way through them because I'm not yes
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.000]   Because I want good Spenserian penmanship
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.080]   But nobody writes with pens anymore. I do so I'm gonna stop teaching penmanship. Yeah
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.520]   So I will notice that your penmanship is really good. I have well they will when they get these handwritten note cards
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:43.240]   I'm thinking I'm gonna do a I'm gonna do an analog Instagram. I'm gonna print a picture
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.620]   Yeah, no card I'm writing so and
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.080]   Checkbox
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.500]   You leave some paper I want to see you write something like this we can Google see how I can't yet
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.600]   I'm still learning it my hand is like a noodle because it's exhausting
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.400]   But I I'm gonna get the fine motor skills. I lacked as a young man
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.200]   Because so because but we were taught you know you remember cursive right do you ever write in cursive?
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.120]   Anybody ever ain cursive and my handwriting is so long. This is why I took typing in sixth grade
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.080]   Yes, I did a summer course in typing because I had my handwriting was so dreadful. I
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:23.940]   Actually, so I'm the opposite. I never took typing I type with basically two fingers maybe four
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.940]   I can really touch that
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.280]   Are you a touch type of slio?
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.840]   No, I'm a two finger also, but I don't look at it. I
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.800]   Taught I'm like Matthew what you had to write
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   You just go like this and so pretty fast. Yeah, me too. I'd be faster if I could touch types
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.360]   So do you remember I forgot this till recently? It's one of those little memories it comes back
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.800]   How did you get an old riled royal temporary? Let's say how did you get an explanation point?
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.080]   shift
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.580]   It was it was down on their lower right wasn't it? No, there was no exclamation point on the older
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.580]   That's right a positive period
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.200]   I forgot that a positive
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.160]   Was it this week at old for us? Yeah, that's insane although it had
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:15.760]   The somewhat meritorious advantage of reducing the number of exclamation marks in writing. Yeah, exactly
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.800]   Yes, true. You don't do bang bang bang bang bang any because you got a
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.820]   Poster feedback space period just past something about how
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.520]   Kids like the kids nowadays, you know millennials
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.200]   Routinely use exclamation marks all the time so now in order to convey
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.320]   What a one exclamation mark would you have to use at least three?
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:44.080]   It's exclamation mark inflation. Yeah, so friend of mine said she dated a guy
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.360]   You'll see soon see why it was very briefly
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:54.480]   Who told her that you should use only three exclamation points in life and I've already used one
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   Nice nice. I love it. No, that's awesome
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.560]   If you want to learn a little Spencerian script, I'll get yourself a little fountain pen
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.480]   Wow, and
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.640]   This is considered simplified over the predecessor which was round hand which is what the declaration of independence is written in that looks so useful
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.040]   I think it's beautiful your calligrapher
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.800]   Oh, it's a little rounded for me. I like the
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.240]   I like the ones with all the unnecessary
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.720]   lines and frills and
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   Extra see this was considered
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:36.480]   Simplified because it only uses seven different strokes. Mm-hmm. And so once you once you learn those and that's what I'm learning right now
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:43.800]   I stroke one is up into the right 30 degree angle. No 52 degree angle stroke two is
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.440]   You don't want to hear
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.720]   And be enough social media you got a lot of time you get really bored easily
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.000]   What else is new in the Google change?
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:02.600]   What were we talking about we were talking about about assistant and what I was the point I was trying to get to before Matthew
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.520]   Took us into the Leo forget that we even got here
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:13.200]   Was we were this is a McLuhan esque point Matthew as a Canadian should should respect this
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.040]   Was there is how we were an oral culture before oral and our all culture before right?
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:24.200]   And and and so you hear Google saying how important voice is and you see this at CES and
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.160]   As I was reading this this odd book and because of the way we learned to read right text has always been an intermediary a blockade
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:40.920]   When you read you hear the words you you talk to yourself with the words you it's everything is actually oral text was this weird
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:49.040]   Exception to that. Yeah, and so the platforms are going to an oral based world. It's slower and more efficient in efficient in some ways
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.760]   But in other ways it requires you know no training no UI no nothing else whereas long as machines are good enough to do it
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.000]   But assistants are terrible at people with handling people with accents. I mean you've seen those
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.360]   videos of like Scottish people
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.920]   They'll learn I guess the Google the Google translation thing that they were announcing for for
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.760]   Assistant I think has starts with some like 27 languages. I forget the number, but it's it's pretty impressive
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   The other way I was trying to because I read these weird books
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.760]   I was trying to translate Latin and used to be you couldn't get that in Google translate you get that
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.480]   So there's another whole sort of rabbit hole about
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.080]   the way that your brain
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:38.140]   Functions and how that's tied to language. There's a fascinating sort of theory about character based languages
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.080]   versus
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.080]   and how and sort of
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   image based languages and how
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:51.120]   one encourages you to think in a specific way and the other so character based languages the theory is it
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:57.080]   Encourages you to split things up into incomprehensible units that only makes sense when they're combined and
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.880]   There's a there's some fascinating research about different languages and how they kind of
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:11.920]   You know encourage you to think in different ways. So going back to an oral culture could have all sorts of you know strange kind of repercussions
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.360]   Yeah, we become very dependent then on the assistance on the machine learning and AI
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.760]   Because they're gonna be the translators to some sort there aren't humans at the other end of this
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.320]   So so I think I think the CS was actually that's one little important part of C. Yes
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.840]   I was trying to get us back on well
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.640]   I I welcome it from the other direction and what are we doing right now?
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:39.560]   But we're doing oral a you are a l content a lot of people who listen to podcasts and even audio books speed them up
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.120]   Almost all players have ability to double the speed or one and a half times the speed
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.640]   And I talked to people all the time is safe when I when I'm in studio when they come in studio in here
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.360]   Is they say you all sound drunk you're so slow because they're used to listening at 2x
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.480]   but that is a good way to get more content in faster and
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.020]   I think that's completely legitimate. Isn't it okay so that fast readers don't
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.560]   Don't enunciate in their mind that they
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   Or is I mean I I don't think it's possible that that's the Evelyn woods method kind of you try not to yeah
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:15.000]   But I think it's really possible. I can't not I never do you don't do the work in your mind when you read just no
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.320]   It's a direct input into your amygdala. Yeah, and I don't know
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:25.040]   But and the consequently I don't I mean I I
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.480]   don't
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   Very well. Oh very quickly
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:38.160]   You read fast you read fast see I actually when I don't understand something I'll slow down and say it
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.920]   In my head sometimes really say it out loud. Yeah, wow. I need to hear it. I think the scribes
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.400]   Scribes which you're turning into I am a scribe
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.840]   Wouldn't do silent reading silent reading was was a was an invention of the came after books
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.600]   Because everything was read out loud. Are you you have one copy of the book?
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.440]   He had 20 people in the room somebody read it that was a lecture in the lecture, right? Yeah, and and and so
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   While they were scrubbing
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.760]   Right verse until until the late 1300s verse was the only acceptable form of text
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.400]   Prose was was crap. Wow
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:21.080]   As you can memorize it and you could and you can share it. I am going to okay
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.760]   That'll be my New Year's resolution just 20 everything I say will be an I am big pentam including the limericks
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.080]   I think limericks are acceptable limericks are acceptable. I think if it just should be that I'm that I'm that I'm
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:40.400]   I think from now on I'm gonna do everything in I am a pentameter and write it with a pen with your
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.080]   Jeff I'm gonna send you one of these barren figs
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.640]   I'm gonna I'm gonna get your address and I'm gonna send you one because you're gonna flip your lid and
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.440]   Then in about two months. I'm sending you a fountain pen. Oh
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.120]   I would be the worst I really have the worst hand where I'll see if I can find something
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.600]   But I think it makes your handwriting better because it grips the paper it this problem with hand
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.920]   See a roller ball never give you good handwriting. It's too slippery. We're I have no clock for sure
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.840]   And this is no one could possibly read this if you can see this
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.400]   That's good and doc
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.720]   That's good. Well, everybody remember those family was a doctor. They all thought I had to be a doctor example
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.320]   I've written this and read there once was a trip from Nantucket by the way
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.000]   Do you know that the original version of the Nantucket limerick was not filthy? No
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.960]   Well, what was it is this too much of a rabbit hole? Oh
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.100]   Yeah, but that's where we live
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.800]   The original
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.120]   Nantucket one let me say I got a fine. I could be very careful
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.360]   But I read this somewhere
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:50.720]   Because you've all heard the filthy one those poor people who live in Nantucket like literally that's the first thing everybody
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:56.680]   Yeah, this is the original there was a man from Nantucket who kept all of his cash in a bucket
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:03.120]   But his daughter named Nan ran away with a man as for the bucket Nantucket
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.960]   No sense Nantucket
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.640]   It's a loose man his daughter took it took it as for the bucket
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.320]   Nantucket, but he followed the pair to pot tuck it the man and the girl with the bucket and he said to the man
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.920]   He was welcome to Nan but as for the bucket paw tuck it
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:32.560]   Then the pair followed pot a man has it oh man
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:39.800]   People are now turning the speed up to 3x where he still have the cash as an asset
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.160]   But Nant and the man stole the money and ran and asked for the bucket man has it
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:51.720]   If you ever run those podcast analytics on this thing people are going to do of the story
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.800]   You hear from Nantucket about the mysterious loss of the bucket
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.960]   We are sorry for Nant as well as the man the cash and the bucket paw tuck it
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   I used to live in the pot tuck at times. Yeah, there's more please don't scroll no more no more. That's okay
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.400]   We're stopping do you want the squire brass roller ball pin? I
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:20.440]   Mean sure and and whatever your judgment is and then you're the and then plus the squire roller ball stand
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:29.440]   I sold out $24 for that sold out so you chomp so do you that's a lot of certain engineered stand oh it is
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   Oh believe me. This is no lightweight stand. This has heft
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:40.720]   You know if you're going back to the 19th century things cost more than exactly
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.480]   What else did Google announce they announced an alarm clock? Well Lenovo allows to smart clock I
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.120]   Actually like the the Amazon Echo spot which is a round
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.720]   Clock with echo in it and a screen
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:00.800]   Lenovo is gonna do basically a smaller version of their small smart display that has a assistant that'll be 80 bucks
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.960]   Someday not you know not right away the alarm clock
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.400]   you know a friend a
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.480]   Friends mother well they gave it to her, but it's the echo
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:18.520]   Whichever one's the circular one with a little screen. Yeah, that's what I love it. That's a great. So so there
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:25.320]   My friend gave it to her mother mothers elderly and kind of losing it so her
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.960]   Grand daughter wanted to check in on her from that and from time as a camera on it
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.160]   You can drop so she drops in yeah, so they set it up so that she can just drop in anytime
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.640]   Say hey grandma. How are you doing? She loves it? Oh, I was waiting for the other shoot a drop on that one
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   But I know it works. It was a happy ending
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.520]   Their nickers
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.520]   Or something I don't
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.640]   Yeah, anyway, I'll get back to you know I love it and I did I did drop in with my mom quite a bit
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:04.080]   And then she I think I she's not I maybe mom. I don't know. She's she changed it so I couldn't oh
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.200]   So I
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.600]   Think she hired somebody from a person by to come by you probably hired a guy from Best Buy
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.320]   My son he was bothering me. Can you please talk about?
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.600]   Fountain pens. How do I turn it off?
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.880]   So talk about this interpreter mode because that's another thing Google announced
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:31.240]   This is is this thing that we have with Google translate where you but it's a little bit different now because because
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:37.120]   Evidently you can say hi you can say to a little bit. I'll be speaking Spanish. How can I assist you?
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.480]   Yeah, so I should explain we're at a desk at a hotel
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.720]   They're gonna test it first in hotel the clay the desk clerk is speaks English and obviously the guest is speaking Chinese
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:57.720]   No, it's a big a small dude's home. What's the tango on K-Shima? Oh, I apologize
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.640]   Okay, Google
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   Chinese interpreter
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.760]   ready when you are
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.860]   That music is not part of it. It's part of the purchase
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.720]   It works assist you
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:21.520]   Nihal which on top so been the
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.000]   I'm gonna find the flow field here. Oh
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.600]   Got it wrong restaurant
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:39.440]   So notice they're going back and forth without additional
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:53.960]   It's a made it said made 12 so okay. There's there's clearly some work to be done. Yeah
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   That was a bird
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.440]   We're supposed to do that
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.900]   Where they supposed to have trans
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.680]   Yeah, the earbuds did it and in fact your phone does it right now and I've used it where if you put it Google
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.000]   Translate and you hold it like this you could speak into it and then we'll translate and they can speak back into it
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.560]   It'll translate back to you and it works better than that. I'll be honest. That was a noisy casino the earbuds work
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.440]   No, I never the earbuds were terrible every system
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:27.240]   And the reason the earbuds were a bad idea is because only you heard the translation right right and so it wasn't clear
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.320]   It's much better. I think doing it with the phone or this assistant on the
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.640]   You know on us Google home hub or something will be better because they can hear the translation
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.320]   So then other you're hearing something and you speak to it and so there's just it's just a more natural flow
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:46.680]   It's it's it's real time translation. I was just watching and I think it was the blacklist and they had I don't know if it's Google
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.880]   Translate, but they had a Chinese character
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.000]   Say things into their phone and then it read them out in English
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.400]   Yeah, you can do that right now in fact being translates very good father Robert told me, you know
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:08.560]   He's he's the digital Jesuit Robert Bell his area has been on a host of our shows like running the Vatican and what not running the Vatican now and
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:15.040]   Well, I don't know running. He might not like that characterization. He's probably the tech guy there. Yeah, I know he's I know he helped
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.280]   He's in charge digital so he runs it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he set up
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.160]   He set up the Skype for the Pope a couple of years ago
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   So and I think he's doing social media and stuff anyway, he goes to these curia meetings which are you know the Pope and Cardinals
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.800]   and apparently the curia when it meets doesn't speak in Latin it speaks in Italian and
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:41.520]   His Italians not great. So he put Google Bing on the table. He's following somewhat but Bing is telling him what they're saying
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.680]   He says it works very well
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.720]   Last time I heard from him though. He said I'm being sent somewhere to learn Italian
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.400]   Who and then we never heard from him again
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.160]   No, actually he's at CES and will be in studio with me on Sunday for this
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.800]   Yeah, yeah, he's having a good time at CES. I bet
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.880]   Fuchsia should we talk about fuchsia?
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:09.360]   It's we still in the changelog. Yeah, I guess this is well. Should I stick with stuff? Maybe that's gonna be who knows
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.920]   Doesn't matter who knows just the problem is I and there's poor Carson is
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.920]   His hand has been
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:21.560]   For quite a while now well, I'm going through the Virgis article on all the things
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.600]   Google announced
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.200]   Let's see this is interpreter mode. Let me get all of these
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.600]   lined up here
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.640]   everything
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:37.400]   Google Assistant CES remember last year it was also very much at Google slash echo
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.720]   CES
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.440]   So it feels like that's the most obvious market opportunity
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.640]   There's minor stuff better auto reply and punctuation when you reply to school. Yeah your voice
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.480]   Yeah, so they don't understand that you implied a comma as you speak
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.960]   Assistant will be in Google Maps
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:03.120]   That's what they say as they say in the verge. That's a Trojan horse because that gets Google assistant everywhere
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.480]   Oh
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.920]   Interesting, isn't it even on iPhone? Yeah?
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:14.200]   Well, you can download Google assistant for the iPhone if you download the odds that you do is opposed to starting to get used to it
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.360]   Yeah, pretty slim though. I find that maps
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.640]   Voice has never worked very well for me. Maybe it'll get better with official assistant. Yeah
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.320]   So this is I mean
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.000]   We were talking about this on Windows weekly. I Paul throughout thinks and I agree
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.600]   Assistance the winner pretty clearly
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.480]   Amazon's echo a close second
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.840]   Mm-hmm, and then all the rest are also ran and it's funny because it's windows weekly
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.280]   But Cortana is not even in the in the in the hunt at this point
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.400]   Let's see the data, right? Yeah
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.920]   the Apple you know
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.880]   Privacy turns out not to be a good thing for a voice assistant
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.440]   Android messages automatic spam protection has started rolling out
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:02.840]   Now you should be aware as as John Porter points out on the verge that that means
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.240]   It's collecting phone numbers
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:11.680]   Automatic spam protection is opt out by default. So you have to turn oh
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:17.160]   You can turn you could turn it off from within the advanced settings menu
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.160]   No time frame for me. Wait, wait, wait, we say that again. It's that's confusing opt out by default sounds like
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.760]   It's not on
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.640]   So I'm not sure if he wrote that confusingly or we're just reading it in our heads
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.320]   But that's a good thing. I mean I have to say hangouts has become
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:43.120]   atrocious for me for Spain. That's terrible. I get so many fake young women approaching me
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.600]   Yeah, what's interesting is because my last name is the port they do it in French in the middle of the night
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.960]   Because they think I'm French Lisa gets young men
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.160]   interestingly in English
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.280]   so it's
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.280]   Not so it's a garbage fire. It's a garbage fire. So I think this you know
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.920]   This is gonna be an important feature. It's in the messages. I don't see it coming to hangouts, but I don't understand why
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.720]   Spam phone calls
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.080]   Aren't controllable
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.720]   What do I mean? I think
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:24.360]   There's a combination of a reluctance on the part of carriers because they could do it and a concern
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.080]   They're not spam they're identifying the spam, but it's they're also concerned about the First Amendment
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   Yeah, probably
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.920]   Now you don't have First Amendment rights on a cell phone network
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.560]   AT&T has no right to do what they want
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.640]   May that's by the way one of the reasons that the at least that's the stated reason that the FCC
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.120]   declared text messages
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.040]   to be what a
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.120]   Publishing service I can't remember what they did, but they did something that says that allowed carriers to then
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.280]   block spam
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.480]   but
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   It also has the upshot the carriers could block political speech
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:05.120]   They don't like or you know messages that they aren't happy with things like that. That was just recently the FCC just did that
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.480]   Google drawings can now be embedded in Google Docs
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:18.120]   I don't know how I've ever used Google. Maybe you will know that you're a calligrapher. I could write I could hand write on my Google Docs
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.200]   You can make any a gram or something
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   Um
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:30.640]   Let's see you could hand write and then scan them and then do OCR
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:43.120]   I can't wait to the day we do a Google change log where I say and now Google OCR can understand spend Syrian script
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.760]   That'll be the day
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:53.920]   That we we good pen no the way the way your head is gonna be able to say by Newton understand Spenserian script
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.160]   It doesn't it doesn't understand any script. I
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.920]   Think we can safely say that concludes
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:10.640]   The things change in the change log change log now we are gonna get back to the 21st century in a moment
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.520]   Including I'm curious what you think about this. They have arrested the 20 year old who hacked
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.120]   Merkle and other politicians the Jadi operated alone
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:31.560]   But he called himself God, so we'll talk about that just a second first a word from Express VPN
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.040]   I think if you if you're technical enough to watch our shows or listen
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:41.560]   You know what a VPN is a virtual private network the idea is it first started businesses used VPNs as a way
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:48.040]   For you to log into the work computer from home in a secure way and it was as if you were at the work on
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:55.720]   The work network even though you weren't you were using a VPN it's a encrypted private tunnel very good technology very strong technology of
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:03.360]   Late people have been using VPNs for other reasons for instance if you had a VPN provider you could use them maybe at an open
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.440]   Wi-Fi access pointer like a coffee shop you you turn on the VPN on your machine
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:16.840]   It's an encrypted tunnel right past all the snoops in the coffee shop to the VPN server and then out into the world
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   People also use it to eliminate geographic restrictions
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.360]   So let's say you want to look like you're coming from London
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:29.080]   Maybe you want to watch the BBC or you look like you're coming from France. Maybe you want to watch a French television
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.720]   So there's lots of reasons you might want to use a VPN and of course one of them
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:40.800]   Maybe most important is you might not want you're in it at service providers snooping on what you're doing in your home
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.520]   the number one
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.440]   Best VPN out there and I could say that with confidence express VPN
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.960]   There are VPNs many of them that will insert ads into your stream or
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.400]   worse
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:03.320]   Express VPN doesn't do any of that no logging your privacy is absolutely secure and they're fast running a good VPN network
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.560]   It doesn't slow you down means lots of servers express VPN has a hundred and forty eight

[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:35.800]   So it's not like it's super expensive, but honestly you do want to pay for a VPN

[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:11.600]   Do and I always recommend this read the privacy policy and then the other thing you should look at is where the VPN is
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:19.840]   If it's in the United States or Australia or any of the five eyes countries, that's a bad idea express VPN is
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.480]   Based in the British Virgin Islands
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   No data retention laws no activity logs no connection logs. You are

[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.680]   This one is it is a good price. I just looked at the regular price and that's a much better price
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.600]   Yeah, and honestly, I see all the time in fact we had I
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:49.320]   Want to speak out of school we had a VPN advertiser before that offered a very inexpensive lifetime subscription and we dumped them
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.400]   I didn't want to do their ads because I know what that means
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.280]   The only way that that makes a financial sense is expensive to run these servers
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:02.560]   The only way that makes financial sense is if they're doing something else there up to some other way to make money on you, right?
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.600]   Express VPN
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:13.500]   So can I go to one of my favorite things of the week yes is Facebook's political ad
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:20.400]   Okay, you knew this would be a rattle. Let's get let's get into it man. Well cuz it's it's it's actually fun
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:27.640]   Where is it online is it on Facebook? So yeah, if you go it's it's it's it's in the Facebook run down
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.240]   The link there and so the first that link I put up
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:38.040]   Is a sample search of this is the Elizabeth Warren's campaign, okay, right? So I don't know if it's gonna matter
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.680]   because
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:45.360]   A it says Facebook's advertising tools might not work as expected when an ad blocker is enabled and B
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.200]   I don't have a Facebook account, but let's see. Oh, yes, it does seem to work
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.720]   So these are so this is Elizabeth. These are the actual ads. Yeah, and and you can see ad performance
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:00.560]   So this search is gonna be who bought the ad or this is whatever
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.200]   anything that mentions was with Warren so I
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.400]   I also did a search on wall
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:12.920]   So and it does say by the way, which is great in the archive who paid for the ad who paid for it when it started then if you click on performance
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:18.200]   Okay, the bottom one of those you'll see and inevitably
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   It's a small each one they're doing a B
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.080]   $100
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.320]   Less than a minute precious and then you see who?
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:31.360]   Demographically male female at age got it and then you scroll down you see location
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.260]   So she was buying women in California in California, right? Okay
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:41.400]   So there were trump ads if you just search on Trump, okay, there's tons
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.080]   It's it's also really telling the volume
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.160]   Earlier this afternoon. I looked on Trump and I saw his ads for after a speech last night
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.520]   I had to scroll like 25 pages to get to them today
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:57.120]   It later on a few hours later because there's so many ads mentioned Trump now. These are some of these are
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:03.040]   Pro and positive. Yeah, but it's interesting who's paying for these
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:11.520]   So do we know for instance, it doesn't say this is a Russian for like every town for gun safety
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.240]   Does it say do we know that it's right?
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.280]   But they have a page and you go to that page, okay?
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.200]   and see what's what so I found it I mean for journalists it's gonna be really interesting to see what messages are out there and
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:30.080]   You know who's pitching what so I looked at Elizabeth Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:35.160]   adds about her adds about guns adds about the wall and
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:43.320]   They're very expensive they're very small because they're testing
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.240]   Yeah, and if you think back to even the Russian troll factory
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:52.680]   The Internet research agency didn't spend a huge amount of money. I mean some of those campaigns were tiny
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:57.960]   Well, this is why I hate to say it. This is why I feel threatened by Facebook and every ad-based
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   Content provider should feel threatened from an advertiser's point of view. This is gold
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:08.320]   Yeah, you can target so precisely. Yeah, and there's other targeting here. Of course
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.680]   We don't see that I wish we we saw like what?
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:16.080]   Like we don't see what the buy it's the name of the buy I'd like to see because when you do an ad buy
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:22.760]   You're picking a interest group, right? Yeah, I would like to see what the actual parameters of the ad buy that's what I'm saying
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   Yes, yes
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   and if you look at the at the
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:34.040]   The news this week about about polling data being shared with the Russians
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:40.640]   What's interesting about that is if you could compare the polling data in certain states with what was bought by Cambridge
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.080]   Analytica
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.880]   Right then you start to see whether collusion really exists and you know that Mueller has this yeah
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:54.680]   But even even this story aside much this is if you look at something like wall and you start to see what are the messages that people are buying
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.040]   To try to get across
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.880]   their view
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.920]   And by the way, it's both sides. Yeah, it's both sides
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:08.160]   And so you see money against money you also see people exploiting this issue for their own purposes
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:15.640]   You see media doing it you see politicians doing it you see interest groups doing it and this is
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.440]   I mean you couldn't get this kind of transparency before you could
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.400]   Know this what you and others have been asking Facebook to do this is what the world has been doing
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.800]   This is what they had to do this is the trip transparency. They had to have is this GPR driven? No
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:37.320]   This is this is American election driven. Yeah, I like whatever this group is American AF
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   I
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.920]   I'm American AF
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.760]   Washington a flack jacket
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:55.600]   He was American AF
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.920]   That's hysterical so there there there selling a t-shirt that says if you build it they won't come and it
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:11.040]   Trump yes, Trump. Yeah, that's good. This was all a result of the congressional hearings about the Russian troll factory
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   Oh, this is the this is the the poster that Trump had on the desk
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:21.360]   Or on the table during the cabinet meeting right the wall is coming the playing off the meme
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.880]   the
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.320]   The game with thrums mean wow, this is really interesting it really is interesting and it's great
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.200]   I went into a rabbit hole like crazy for a while. Here's Adam Schiff. Yeah for Congress
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   Harry a Congress
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:41.520]   You see it's a whole hundred dollar box. They're so they're so efficient though exactly he's buying these older demographics
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.640]   Yeah, entirely in California. Well, we can't see as they're doing
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:53.080]   ABs on other interest and other things I would love to see that but good good on Facebook for making this available
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.360]   Yes, I just I just it's it's I mean dr. Matthew
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.120]   I thought of you as I was playing with this I can imagine the stories that you're gonna get out of this
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.960]   Yeah, it's a very useful tool and now so go ahead. It sounds like they're gonna exclude
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.760]   News stories from it at least eventually that was the controversy and there's no there's some media that's here is that if it had a
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:20.120]   political content then Facebook was saying you had to register as a political advertiser and you had to have your ad here the
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.280]   New York Times scream bloody murder, but I
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:30.640]   Facebook just handled it badly because what Facebook should have said at the beginning is we're gonna go for transparency and advertising
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.760]   starting with
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:37.080]   All that's an applicable content that includes everything and what can you object to New York Times?
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.840]   You should be doing this instead the New York Times said we were trying to make us register as a political actor
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.440]   We would object to that a or B. You're not taking our ad because we wouldn't do this
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.240]   So they handle it horribly. She says somebody paid for that nice
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.480]   What are they what are they how well did it do sponsored by scamazon?
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.880]   Fantastic I searched for twit. This is all I found
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:09.240]   So Stephen Miller and that gun-loving attention twit are the same person who to fuck and it's Stephen Miller's face in a
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.560]   Some girls
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.960]   So this is why Jeff you're teaching
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.720]   There was aimed at
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.960]   men
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.240]   Really men and unknown and mostly in Texas, Florida and New York
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.880]   Those are our big population states
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:37.240]   And gun-loving and gun-loving as well. So this is why Jeff you teach
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.560]   data mining to journalists
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.320]   This is yeah, yeah data is very important and the ability to this would be a lot of work
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:51.120]   But presumably there's a methodology you could use to go through stuff like this and make some sense out of it and get a story
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   I don't know if there was an API for this
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.040]   I was gonna ask people I know that what you see is you see
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.760]   30 different ads that are basically the same
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.400]   Yeah, you want to be able to compile that into one and get some sense of what the total reach was
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.920]   Yeah, this is the raw this is the raw raw data and then the reach numbers are all in small ranges
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.600]   I mean it's a limited use yeah when we get to the other story
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.680]   I really want to talk about which is the the kids are all right story
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.760]   If you tie this to that
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.280]   One thing that researchers don't know is what do you what are people seeing in their feeds?
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.960]   what's influencing them in that way and
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:34.600]   This starts to get to answer that a little bit it starts to say what are old people seen?
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.480]   So your medium article
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   Basically talked about a research study from NYU and Princeton
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.220]   Justin
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.640]   Justin out
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.840]   And Andrew guest Jonathan Nagler Joshua Tucker. I knew this about this from Josh
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.680]   So they they I'll explain a little bit first
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.400]   they used a couple of
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.440]   lists of
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.600]   fake news domains one from Craig Silverman of BuzzFeed who we all love plus another one and then they asked
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.440]   Who's sharing that on Facebook and the way they did this they went to you govern they asked people some questions
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:15.440]   What's your political how old are you what's your political bent and so on then they said are you and they're very transparent
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:19.040]   They said are you willing to install an app that will let us
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.760]   See what you're sharing on Facebook
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.680]   and
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.960]   Half the 3500 people they went to said yes
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.960]   So they got a body of people and they saw what are they sharing the in the caveat here is obvious
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.440]   There's a limited body of fake news. So there's other fake news. They weren't looking at but
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:44.960]   I'm not selecting a group of people because they're on you gov to begin with right right?
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:51.520]   So there's all kinds of caveats like that and they first you install and they agreed to do it all of that all of that yeah, but
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.200]   What what came out of this
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.400]   Is is fascinating is really an important first step of research because what it said was number one that
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:08.440]   Very little again. These were the domains that Craig Silverman said were the most shared
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.920]   These were the big ones right okay
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:15.840]   These are the ones that he said were most seen somewhat somewhat overpowering those other factors
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:20.440]   So only 88.2% of people shared any of it
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:26.120]   So sharing was not big more than any per per cent people did not share it, but here is the key point
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:34.680]   The sharing was done by old people people at 65 plus shared seven times more than people 18 to 29
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:42.440]   Which is to say stealing a joke from Josh Tucker the kids are all right grandpa's the problem. Yeah, this age factor stood
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:50.360]   Irregardless of education party affiliation ideology sex race or income
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:55.320]   They say they factored for that and still age was the key factor here
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:00.840]   Yes conservatives ultra conservatives and independence shared more the democrats though
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:07.320]   They the researchers say at this time most of the content known as fake was pro-Trump so that's somewhat self-selecting
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:15.160]   Um, and finally they found that people who share the most on facebook were the least likely to share crap
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.440]   So there's all these things that we think everybody's sharing this stuff everybody's seeing this stuff
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.200]   The kids are screwing up the world and people who share a lot of stuff are messing up
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:29.320]   No, people who share a lot do know the difference between fact and not and choosing not to share this stuff
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.000]   No, the kids are okay. It's old people. So a lot of this talk
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.960]   We have about how we need news literacy for young people because they're messing up. No, we need this grandpa
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:46.120]   Uh, that's the you should also cross correlate this with who votes because grandpa and grandma vote a hell of a lot more than
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.960]   Yeah
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.640]   Some of you
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.040]   So you start to now you know you take this with the facebook
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.440]   thing we just saw
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.120]   And say one thing I want to see is I want to see also what's their media consumption
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.760]   Who's watching fox news who's listening to talk radio who has a same clear station near them
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.960]   If if it's conservatives, you know, does that have an impact?
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.280]   You know that of this is that surprising after all nationalism is essentially nostalgia
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.800]   And it makes sense it would be appeal to older people
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:20.120]   That younger people who are going to be around longer might be more concerned about global issues than national issues
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:24.360]   Absolutely. No, that's not the narrative and media the narrative media has been
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:29.640]   Young people are messing up the world. Yes people who share so much on facebook are messing up the world not the case
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.320]   Yeah, in fact, I think all right matthew
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.400]   He wrote I think young people we got to get young people to vote and that'll solve a lot of problems
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:40.360]   Yeah, go ahead matthew jeff have you seen uh, yo-kai banklors book network propaganda?
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   behind me. I haven't read it yet
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:49.800]   Uh, uh, you read it yet? It's good. It's really good. Yeah, it's good. Um, obviously like he's extremely knowledgeable and so are his
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.840]   Co-authors, but an interesting part of what he's looking at the issue of whether
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:00.760]   Facebook helped swing the election and one of the main true answers that is that old people
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:08.840]   Swung the election and old people aren't on facebook. Yeah interesting. You'd be better off blaming fox news than you would facebook
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   I think so too. Yes, banklors earlier book the wealth of networks i've read and is really really really good
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.760]   Yeah, he's a dancest i mean he's been studying this stuff, you know longer than
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   most of us have
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.760]   And my colleague karry brown interviewed him there. Unfortunately, there's not a tape
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.280]   Um, but uh, but yeah, he's just amazing
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.960]   So I think I think the my only point is that there's a lot of
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:42.680]   Provocative presumptions in media about the state of things and we need research and we need data because the interventions are often the wrong
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:49.480]   The wrong presumptions and and and it's not just the blatherings and media. It's also going to go to regulation and what's done there
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.680]   We got to have research like this and fund more research like this
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:59.400]   Um, it does it does as much as I hate to say mark Zuckerberg was right when his first response was
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.880]   Yeah, you know fake news is a tiny tiny proportion of what happens on facebook
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.520]   And so it's hard to believe it had any impact more and more research comes out
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.600]   Suggest that he might actually have been right about that
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.920]   Yeah, yeah, it just in a pr sense. It wasn't wise to say so
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.320]   right
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.200]   So thank you. Those are my two favorite stories in the week. I wanted to get done because I think a really fascinating how they interlock
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   Yeah, no kidding network propaganda manipulation disinformation and radicalization in american politics. You okay?
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:37.800]   Benkler from oxford university press what he does which is great is he makes everything creative commons
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   Uh, you can download it free if you don't download it for free. Yeah
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.720]   Uh, and I yokai. However, I bought your book. Yeah friends by friend books. Yeah
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.920]   Well, especially when friends agree
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:58.200]   So especially helpful when the friends agree so, um, gosh, this seems like such a minor thing
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.240]   uh
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   annula merkel, uh, the
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:07.800]   Prime minister of germany and many other german politicians were hacked massive data dump
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.800]   Uh released of all sorts of stuff emails chat transcripts photos and phone numbers
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.000]   You know this story broke last week. I haven't seen a lot of embarrassing stuff. Was there embarrassing information?
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.880]   I think the german media has been so cautious about
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.080]   Good on them unlike unlike the dusted emails
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.640]   They immediately went into
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.200]   Worry mode and germany just went through a huge journalistic scandal i wrote about a few weeks ago
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.920]   Uh of spiegel of making up stories and so they're very much a navel gazing
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.480]   Uh mode right now and
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   And immediately they have some
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:49.640]   They have some pretty stringent laws around that's reporting private information as well
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:56.760]   So, uh, the other thing they did very quickly the bk a german's germany's investigative police force arrested
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:02.200]   Uh somebody they say was responsible for this league all by himself a 20 where you're old
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.840]   He's actually confessed
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.800]   Um, and he says i was acting alone
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:13.400]   Notably the only party that he didn't get affected by this was the uh of day the far right party
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.360]   Interesting
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.360]   Suspect and you'll notice that if you look at it
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:23.640]   Yeah, most of what he did was guess passwords and or use social engineering
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:31.080]   So really the issue is more really info set one the one two three four passwords will get you a lot of information
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.240]   Uh
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.400]   Will they never learn well what was pade esta's password wasn't it password or was that a
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.120]   It was something bad. I think it was something
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.160]   No, no, no, no, I remember probably was pade esta got fished. It was fish. That's right. Yeah
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.160]   Is and we said this many times if you are the target
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.040]   uh particular if you're targeted in nation state
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   It's I don't you have to have extremely good operational security. It's I mean, yeah, you have
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:05.080]   You have no chance because there's all sorts of ways they can get your password doesn't have to be one and social engineering is way more powerful
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.640]   Right than just press those planes up to me. Um, steve and absentia
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.040]   Um
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.240]   The google google puts out its insecurity dongle thing. Yeah, right
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.520]   Yeah, thank you. What is again? Matthew?
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.480]   Well, one is a ubiki googles is not it's called the tyke google says their version of a ubiki
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.960]   And so how does and they say that that has an impact on stopping fishing. How does that
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.080]   It's basically two factor
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.240]   So
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:42.680]   It uh, the reason it would help with fishing is I can get you to enter in your credentials with a fishing without this
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:49.560]   But what I won't get is this dongle and this one time password refreshes every 30 seconds
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.840]   So unless the fishing attack is very timely
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:59.080]   Uh, nothing you get from it will help you steal that account and this is going to be harder and harder
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:04.040]   It's going to be harder to convince people. Hey, you should type in the code from your little
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:09.080]   Key like as soon as you ask for that. It's going to be obvious. Right what you're trying to do
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.000]   I think we're getting we're gonna we're gonna get pretty good at this stuff. Uh, yeah
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.040]   And certainly the people who want to can
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.000]   the disadvantage of using a two factor
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:24.840]   Well, I use two factor with google and everybody should and with everything you can use and if
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.160]   If you're willing to use a key like the ubiki or that i'm not sure I'd use the titan
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:35.400]   But uh, I I love ubiko and their ubikis are great. I carry one with me at all times
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.920]   And that's a pretty good protection because
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.200]   Uh, somebody would it's not a phone. They would
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.840]   It's not a text message. They would physically have to get this key from me
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:52.680]   Um, when I put this in a usb slot and press the button it it generates that one time code
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.160]   That's a pretty secure
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.640]   And I was just actually reading about how easy it is
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.280]   To get access to
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:06.360]   The texts even if you don't have access to the person's phone, right you can basically spoof
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.880]   Um
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:13.240]   Messages and effectively get the text with the two factor. So there are two factors useless to you now, right?
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.800]   That's not a usb c though. Was it like, oh
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.160]   Uh, you can just put an adapter on that if you want and the tiny isn't it?
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:23.800]   Google sells does both bluetooth actually I think they do a double uh key
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:29.400]   They do a bluetooth one and they do a usb one and that's because iPhones don't have
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.280]   A way to do a usb thing or nfc
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.360]   Uh, this so they have to use something that uh, that does bluetooth
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.720]   But that's fine and google has a little bluetooth authentication happen all that stuff
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.120]   It the problem is inconvenient
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.200]   You know, you can't lose this
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:51.880]   Uh, it's uh, it also eliminates if you use the strong authentication that google has available at the advanced protection
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.520]   Uh, then there's other things you can't do
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.920]   Uh, so advanced protection was too difficult. So what happens if you do lose that?
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:04.520]   Um, if you're not using advanced protection, you can recover it using a phone number or something like that
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.680]   That's an important point by the way
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:13.240]   Whatever the fallback method is that's the weakest link. Yeah, so if you have a bank that says, oh use a yuba key
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.440]   Or if you use lose your yuba key, you can we can ask for an SMS message. That's what hackers are going to use
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.080]   So that says insecure is SMS
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.000]   So that's important to understand that as well. This is these are complicated things
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.800]   But I think we're getting better at understanding them and getting more
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.240]   I do think banks have gotten better at least i've noticed Canadian banks have with
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:38.840]   Um security questions, so it's no longer mothers maiden name. It's things like who was your favorite superhero
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.400]   You know, what was your
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:47.240]   Those are terrible those similar but they're better than they used to be. Yeah, better than they used to be. Yeah, yeah
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.120]   um
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.120]   Yeah, I um
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:58.920]   Yeah, um, I use something uh, I use strong encryption technologies. I use gpg and
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.840]   Um, you know the yuba key and stuff like that you can get by the way
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.920]   Somebody's saying and it's true you can get you're gonna have multiple yubikis registered with your two factor
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.040]   In most cases. So if you lose, oh, so you can keep one hidden somewhere
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   Wouldn't have all yeah, so i've wanted home this
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:19.880]   Yeah, um, I use key base. I want I should give them a plug. Maybe I do too. Do you I really love these guys
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.360]   Um more and more. I'm using key base for a lot of things
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:31.320]   Uh, I this is a free service, which is pretty remarkable. What do you use it for? I signed up but everything so
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.400]   uh
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.000]   What you do what I would recommend doing is generate a pgp key
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.040]   Locally don't that you can have them do it, but it's not as good
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:45.160]   Do it locally don't give them the public the private key keep the private key to yourself
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:50.600]   That's always the thing you must keep secure in fact you can put it on a yubike if you want if you really want to make it secure
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.400]   Uh, but do give them the private key that way I can follow matthew matthew
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.320]   You can follow me and when I want to send a message to matthew encrypted. I can do that
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.920]   Uh, but there's other things they offer git so I use their encrypted kit to store all my keys
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.720]   But also my taxes things. I want to keep private
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:15.000]   Um, they also have a file system that is an encrypted file system and that's kind of wild if I go to leo loport
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.800]   dot key base
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.400]   dot pub
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.960]   You'll get a file. This is actually what appears in my uh email
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   Signature that can't be changed by anybody but me and you'd have to have my private key to modify this
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:33.880]   And this has all of this is basically a proof of who I am what I do
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.240]   These all these sites the phone number everything those are mine
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.760]   Certified by me and key base and so that's a nice feature
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.680]   I use this as my email signature now because it can't be modified
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.520]   Um
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   I can go on and on key base is is a really good way to use pgp
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.320]   They have chat as well slack style
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.480]   Uh chat I use that
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.360]   Uh, so you and I could have encrypted chat as good as signal. It's the same quality of uh chat
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.480]   See I signed up I signed up a long time ago when I thought it was just you know authentication that thought
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:12.200]   Well, it was just yeah, but I didn't realize I had all this other added so many they have a file system encrypted file system now
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.440]   They have um
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   This encrypted chat
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:22.360]   Uh, they have a believe it or not. They have a uh, crypto currency as well that they're supporting called lumens
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.200]   I'm not sure what that's right. Yeah. I'm not sure what that's involved with
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.760]   and then and then so let me what is your
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.600]   uh
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600]   What is your uh, key base?
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.080]   Let me search for all the matthews with one tea
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.120]   And I can follow you and then that way if you the best thing about that there it is matthew
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.560]   I the best thing about that I already am following you is
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.280]   There you go. You change your key as I do
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.200]   You know once in a while
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:54.520]   Uh, it will check you can change it here. So I'll always have the latest if I'm messaging with you and you change your key
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.040]   It will tell me
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.320]   His key has changed. You might want to verify that he did that
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.440]   You also got to buy all info. Yeah, you should
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.320]   Do jobs that go they work at giga. Yeah
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:10.200]   You I would keep this I use this like crazy. I really think this is and it's free
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.760]   The guys who did this
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:19.800]   Uh, I think made money on another startup. I'm trying to remember their uh, yeah, because free services always make me nervous as they should
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.120]   Um, but they're they're pretty amazing. Uh, they've really done
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.720]   Some incredible those messages in the chat are also exploding you can have exploding messages
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.520]   Nice
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:38.120]   So after you set the timer so after 30 seconds or a minute or an hour like mission impossible the message self-destructs
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.520]   Um
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520]   Yeah, they have teams they have chat
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:49.320]   It's really they've raised money. So they must have some way of I think of monetizing it's fascinating
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.440]   but uh, yeah right now it's completely free and
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.920]   Did you um, maybe this is going off topic, but I
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.480]   Can't do that
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.840]   Oh
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.040]   What I wrote about uh, the internet archive
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:10.120]   Making an appeal to get Brazilian content. Um, it's interesting that
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:15.720]   Uh, obviously they back up all kinds of things on the internet archive and they do it routinely but
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.720]   um
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.120]   Uh, chase is god. I think his name reached out
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.720]   Specifically to people saying look if you have
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.360]   Brazilian content that you think might go away
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.040]   Because there's a new resident and we're about boss in our
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.520]   Yeah, they're worried about censorship and um, and it was just fascinating
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.040]   Uh
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.680]   So they're doing a special run kind of to
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.040]   Backup things in case they disappear
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.680]   You know, new sites information about the country and so on but
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.480]   um, it just reminded me of how much
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.760]   The archive does and
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.440]   Also of how
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.800]   So Jason I think runs something called the archive team
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.640]   And mostly volunteers. I believe and you can actually install a virtual machine
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.520]   um, that will use your
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.320]   spare cycles and
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:16.760]   Um web browser to help the archive. Oh, I'm gonna do that right now. Bro. Yeah, that's awesome
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.960]   Went up and it was really easy and it doesn't use a lot
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.840]   Um, it's not you're not going to notice. I don't think
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.960]   Um, and then it it I mentioned how civil
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.640]   the the
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.320]   blockchain powered
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.680]   Journalism platform one of their sort of pitches was that the blockchain makes
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.360]   um
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:44.120]   Archiving permanent archiving of content right easier because it effectively goes to everyone who participates in the blockchain
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.720]   Yeah, although you really wouldn't want to store the entire internet archive on your normal hard drive. It doesn't scale
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.440]   but um
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.640]   Popular
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.840]   So popular is one of the magazines that's based on civil
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.240]   They published the first
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.120]   uh article that was effectively distributed
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.200]   On the black chain or archived on the blockchain and they also mentioned
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.000]   That this is the rabbit hole. They mentioned that it was
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   um
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.240]   Stored or distributed via the interplanetary file system. Have you heard of that one?
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.960]   Yeah, that rings a bell. Tell me about that. Yes
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.240]   So ipf s is uh, I just love the name interplanetary file system
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.640]   Their ambition assumption is right. You want uh file system. That's
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.960]   Extremely distributed
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   Um that it's open source. No one controls it. It's a little like I guess free net if you remember that one
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.520]   Um, there's been sort of similar
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.040]   Projects, but uh, it's got it's it's got a built-in
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.560]   Um hashing encryption. Um, it's a fascinating. I need to do more
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.800]   Research, but I I thought it was an interesting uh, yeah
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:58.200]   These guys, you know, if you've used the way back machine, I know a lot of our listeners and viewers are familiar with that
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.960]   You you know about uh
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.680]   internet archive. They're saving the entire internet
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:08.520]   And uh boy is this a huge and important thing. I didn't know that I could help so by offering
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:11.320]   Yeah, I didn't know that he's like oh so i'm gonna yeah archive team
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:16.040]   I I want to join the archive team man. I got a few computers lying around
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:22.360]   There's a whole wiki. It's a whole wiki that describes how they do it and you just download a virtual machine and
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.160]   away you go
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.520]   Nice
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.880]   I will do that. I should have saved that for my thing at the end. Oh damn
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.560]   Yeah, we both just gave away our things. Yeah. All right. There's always more
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.880]   I still have my numbers. Are you ready for free samples from amazon?
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.240]   Yeah, please that's really interesting
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.120]   so um apparently
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:52.040]   Amazon wants to use this according to axios. Let me actually quote the axios story
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:57.960]   Amazon wants to use what it knows about what you like what you want to buy to send you
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.240]   Free samples from brands like maybelline
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:07.480]   How about Folger's coffee see there if they send me Folger's coffee. They're making a they don't know as much about me as they think
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.880]   Please don't do that. Please don't i'll take some maybelline but no Folger's coffee
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.760]   This is really interesting because free samples are an age old form of marketing
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.160]   You know, you can't go into a big box store like a Costco or a sam's club without being
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.920]   Having food and other things pressed upon you when I was in advance
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.760]   We invested in a company years ago that would did nothing but this but it was a little too early
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.560]   But uh if I know one piece of data about you and I said you the free sample. It's a great hook
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.720]   Absolutely
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.760]   And that's something amazon says google and facebook can't match
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.120]   They don't really have your address
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.880]   They don't have your physical address
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.720]   Oh that problem, right? Well, maybe they do. Yeah
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:56.280]   That's a point. That's a point. Yeah, I mean amazon's always i'm getting boxes on every day. So yeah
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.240]   Way this box if google said, uh, you know, here's 10 free things all you have to do is give me your address. You're gonna give it your dress true
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.560]   True
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.120]   uh
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.440]   Apparently customers have already acknowledged getting samples of project products from major brands
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.400]   Mascara from lauriol's maybelline brand and Folger's coffee
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.880]   Amazon said one twitter user sent me a random coffee sample
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.440]   Is it because i've liked 15 different types of coffee in my cart?
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.480]   Yeah, maybe
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.160]   They should do I would think are they saying out separate order?
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.160]   They should be putting this in with your order. So you have a
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.360]   uh
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.600]   Easter egg with your orders you have more reasons to want to order because you get something free with it
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.280]   And it's a little a little delight
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:45.080]   I used to always order my audio gear from sweet water because they throw a few candy pieces in the box
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.640]   Well, just like the prepped the like the president brings candy to medium. That's right. It's nothing. I'm always
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.880]   Yeah
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:57.400]   I gave you candy. I wonder what kind of candy he brought though. I do too. I really wonder was it sees
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:00.040]   Warren buffets candy. No
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   Was it cosmic candy with a little uh makes you give it a little buzz, maybe was it made in china?
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:12.120]   Amazon flavored
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.200]   Good and plenty thanks to the decline of apple
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.480]   Amazon is now the most valuable us company first. I'm ever
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:26.440]   At $797 billion not a trillion dollar company
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.600]   Nobody is a trillion anymore apples about 700 some billion
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.240]   So amazon microsoft
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.560]   It was is number two with 785 but amazon passed it on monday
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.880]   And basil is about to lose half of that
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:46.680]   He's going to give it to his wife. I thought that was by the way that tweet from jeff and we i wasn't going to do the story because i didn't think it was
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.480]   You know, i mean, it's not i think it's good. What's interesting is how he did it. Yeah, I thought the tweet was really
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.200]   kind of sweet
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.640]   Yeah
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.680]   Um
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:02.120]   And he did it the way people used to do tweets went before there was 250 characters
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.920]   You'd take a picture of text
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.000]   And tweet it
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.280]   Maybe he hadn't gotten the memo that there's enough room to type that now
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.320]   He announced his uh
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.120]   Divorce from his wife of 25 years, but it sounds like their friends
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.360]   He said if we'd known we would separate after 25 years we'd do it all again
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:28.680]   Uh, though the labels might be different we remain a family and we remain cherished friends. I thought that was really sweet
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.600]   Yeah, if he knew he
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.160]   If he knew he had to give up 70 billion dollars, what do you do that again? Well, you know, I
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:41.320]   I like gossip so I read all the stories and she was right. They met when he he was at shaw
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.680]   Yeah before he even started before he she drove
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:50.280]   him across country they drove across country together while he's typing the business plan for amazon
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:57.000]   She's driving to seattle. She worked in the warehouse. She did fulfill. She worked. She showed. Yeah, she better get half of it
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.600]   She better get half of it
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.480]   And she will and she's I think almost certainly will
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:10.280]   But it but it does point out that that it's neither of their interests for him to uh have to liquidate
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.840]   To pay for
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.120]   Um, and fan is limited to vote together
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.000]   He has what is something like 16 percent of amazon stock
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.800]   Uh, but he has only allowed it a liquid a billion dollars a year liquidated a billion dollars a year
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:29.640]   Yeah, I think they're both their interests to build wealth. Yeah, this way so and to vote together and so on so it's
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:36.600]   Presuming they act like grownups. It shouldn't affect the company in full disclosure as I have some amazon stock
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.960]   I'm sure I do too. I probably do but it's not I never bought it
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.520]   It's in a I have all of them all of the stocks in the s&p 500
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:54.920]   So those are all my investments are index funds and big baskets. So it is by by by
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:01.000]   Millions of miles the best performing single stock i've ever bought amazon is yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.160]   You know it kills me because I look and I watch and I think oh, I wish I could buy some google or apple or amazon
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.160]   then
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.720]   Then you know things happen and I go god, I'm sure glad i'll have any apple stock
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.640]   So it you know, I don't know
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:22.440]   So cramer says I have this in the in the rundown that that there's time to buy all the fangs stocks if he doesn't think netflix
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:27.640]   But he thinks that they're all undervalued though. Well, this is I don't want to make those calculations
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:30.760]   I don't want to have to do market timing. That's why I invest
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.720]   In the strength of the united states economy
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:43.720]   What's that famous phrase? Um, I'm not interested in the return on my money. I'm interested in the return of my money
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:53.320]   Yes, I'd like it back, please or or as I said about my timing stock after I got it my f u money said f u to me
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:59.240]   Um, oh man, there's so many other stories. You want to do the right to be forgotten?
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.560]   Yeah, that's
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:09.080]   Fairly minor, but uh, it's just that it now reaches france's effort to say you can't just erase stuff in france
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.840]   You have to do it worldwide
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.720]   Which google's fighting i'm glad they're fighting it now reaches europe's highest court. So we'll see where this goes
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.280]   Yeah, that's a ridiculous requirement
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.440]   Amen. Well, can't it has been
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.840]   Canada my friend i know i know i know
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.240]   Not that you
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.520]   Gonna break the internet
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.080]   But I mean the whole right to be forgotten thing is broken and it passed it's survived
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.800]   Yeah, it's bad enough all by itself but to implement it in a way or to require everyone
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.520]   To remove it because your country decided
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.560]   It's just hello russia
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:47.640]   You said it you said it president. Yeah, but when I when I say this in europe i get they they go
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.000]   They jumped on my throat. They think right to be forgotten is a raging success
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.800]   The right i mean the way they look at personal information is very different
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:02.600]   Google made a 60 million dollar acquisition that's you know larry page's cigarette money
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.320]   uh, they bought
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:10.440]   an expert community and answer engine called super pod the speculation according to search engine land is
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.320]   It's an acquirer. They just want the
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.960]   found i would imagine it for google assistant
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:22.680]   Although somebody was saying when is google gonna buy or maybe microsoft actually it'd be better by microsoft to buy a stack exchange
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.560]   Which is i mean microsoft snapping up
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:32.600]   They got github they're kind of trying to be the open platform, you know corporate advocate
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.680]   Stack exchange would be a very good way to reach out to developers. I wonder if that's on there
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.480]   On their shopping list
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:45.560]   Um, I don't care about system wide dark mode and android qd. I hate shark mode. I just mind started
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.280]   I turn it off immediately
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.760]   Good
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.000]   Uh, so I won't do the story then so
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.960]   Feelings about dark mode so there
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.200]   Rrrr
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.720]   So all right here's one
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.120]   Um, I know what yes, I know what you want to do, but oh really okay
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:14.920]   Yeah, because it's actually interesting is it the vibrator one. Yeah, so cbs gave it a give it an award to a
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.880]   AI powered smart
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.240]   vibrator
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:25.960]   And then withdrew the award saying it was a moral obscene and decent or profane under its rules, which is
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:31.240]   sexist as hell so now they're getting proper hell because they're because it's a female
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:36.920]   Organism well wait a minute. I mean is there a male orgasm machine that they did give the award to
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.600]   Well, but they're basically saying no
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.960]   Well, are they saying we go back for a minute some they're being what was yes
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:50.600]   You were in cbs in the old days and see yes in the old days you went to one whole hall and what was it?
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.120]   It was nothing
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.880]   That'd be your boo and they moved that out. Yeah, they can they said that down so
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.040]   So well, but ces's roots are masturbation. Come on
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:04.200]   That is not a show title no matter what you say chat room
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.960]   Um
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:15.640]   If we include a historical masturbation then sure you could you could you could you could I think properly say that ces
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:21.720]   Realize that having because what it was is you know, it was there were the rise of the vhs and recorders
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.320]   All of a sudden a lot of the videotapes being sold were adult
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.080]   so they
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.920]   At first they were getting all these people booths with adult videotapes. They put them off in a
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:36.520]   Showman eventually not not much longer after that. They said get out of here go do your own thing
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:42.360]   And then for a while it was it was held at the same time as ces but not related to ces
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.480]   Uh, and was it the avn adult video network expo or something?
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.320]   And now it's I think even at a different time. I think you could say
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.040]   They pushed them out
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.720]   So that's this is more of the same. They know they don't want ces to become
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:05.800]   An adult expo. No, but the interesting but this wasn't this was this was done in partnership with the university of was university of Oregon
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.320]   So here's an update
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.800]   That's kind of interesting an update as of oh, oh yesterday at 3 p.m
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:20.120]   A spokesperson for ces told motherboard the product does not fit into any of our existing product categories
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.320]   And should not have been accepted for the innovation awards program
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:29.720]   Cta has communicated this position to lori decarlo. We have apologized to the company for our mistake
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.520]   So now they're saying it's not a moral just doesn't fit
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.400]   Meanwhile ces has a talking toilet
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.920]   Yeah, I was just gonna mention that it's a $7,000
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.120]   Alexa powered toilet lio soaps that let me know
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.360]   expensive, but yeah
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.160]   A smart toilet for your dog rear features the uh, I didn't
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:57.000]   What could it possibly do? Matthew? What could it so the lights the lights can sync up to your playlist?
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.200]   Uh, if you use, uh, Alexa
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:03.400]   So you danced on the toilet so there's that
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.000]   I swear we saw this last year, but this was a different company. Is that why I mean I didn't
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.160]   I guess there's different smart toilets over here every year. I finally got the total to work
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.880]   Oh, go ahead. I like it hotel
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.880]   It was okay, but a little creepy you get used to it pretty soon you crave it
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.400]   What did you get to work? I'm sorry. I'm so totally to work with japanese
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.520]   But washing toilet. Yeah. Oh, okay
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.400]   Now I don't want to live without it
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.000]   Do you have it?
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   Oh, yeah, there's a sponsor jeff
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:39.320]   You can get an answer to it. Not only do I have one in every bathroom of my house and then oh, I
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.680]   Can see I can see getting placed them because we love them so much is it like
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.680]   Do you add it to an existing toilet? Yes, you can. Okay. Yeah
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.360]   Yeah
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   Because there's one I that my my aunt swears by well
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.240]   There's a total total. I'm sure it's not the same idea of google
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.160]   uh
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.440]   restrooms
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.760]   Really? I've been in google restrooms where there's totos. I think that's very civilized
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.640]   It is. I just find it. I've always found it fascinating and maybe this is a rabbit hole
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.840]   We don't want to go down, but I have always found it fascinating
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.480]   visiting europe how
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.720]   The days are just totally taken for granted and everybody thinks it's weird not to have one and in north america
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.960]   It's it's so unusual that if you even mention it
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   People just think it's such a bizarre kind of yeah, you know, it's my mother's family
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:42.120]   Had some narrative well relatives who went to live in europe for like a year and they came back all european with like bores and accents
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.280]   And in in louis town, Illinois little louis town, Illinois
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:51.000]   They in their house they installed a bidet and the entire town was scandalized
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.320]   Scandalized. Yes. Scandalized. Where did they get it?
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.200]   If it or I don't know it brought it back on the ship. I don't know it gets bidets now everywhere. Yeah
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.680]   Yeah, but in the old days like you literally know
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.920]   Dipper in the rest of the world. We are considered filthy americans for our yeah, sorry
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.320]   Well, though. We also have to provide I want to get through this. We also have to provide automated dog toilet
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.920]   I think that's a good idea. Was that a se? Yes. Oh, yes. Yes. Yeah, well. We have an automated cat
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.640]   Kitty live back. Yes
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.320]   Well, a dog so dogs have to go outside where does it put it?
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   it um
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.320]   It's a giant spaceship
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.400]   Okay, and the cat gets goes in and then there's normal litter there
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:38.040]   Yeah, and then after the cat gets out it senses the cat is as left and it starts to rotate
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.320]   Okay, and then uh, I don't know
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.440]   Pan or something there's a whole thing going on and then you know
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.960]   Just once it makes a mistake and the cat is traumatized it never takes a pee again
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:53.160]   Does it wrap it up in a baggie and like leave it sort of yeah, okay kind of sort of
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:59.320]   Did you cat have any problems adjusting to it? No, no now Lisa wants to toilet train the kitties
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:02.440]   But I think that's inconsistent with the total
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:09.400]   Because we got a big it wasn't automated, but we got a big
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.640]   cat litter
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.240]   Pan with uh
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:19.560]   With a roof on it and all sorts of features and the cat would not go anywhere near it. Yeah cats are funny that way
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:24.840]   Yeah, um, no interesting. Yeah, but I think if the cat gets squirted once by the toilet, it's not
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.400]   Yeah, it's not going back
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.000]   so uh
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   On october 10th
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.600]   The cum
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.000]   Here comes Lisa. I don't know if i'm in trouble or not
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.160]   CES rewrote this award on october 10th

[01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:00.680]   In the robotics my my our ceo ladies and gentlemen lisa loport no
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.640]   Take a bow
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   Right now she doesn't want to be related to you know
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.720]   Uh
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:14.440]   The uh, they were an honoree in the robotics and drone category and that's actually not so far fenched because no
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:22.680]   It was developed, uh, with using eight technology and robotics partnerships in partnership with the Oregon state university product development lab
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:29.240]   Uh, this is the oce personal massager formerly called vella. Oh, I have a vella
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.200]   I didn't realize this was the same it looked the same
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.800]   Well, I I have to review everything sure
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.240]   um
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:42.200]   On october 31st cta email. This is two two weeks later three weeks later
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.360]   Emailed laura decarlos team to inform them the association was revoking the award
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:54.680]   Saying it was a moral obscene and decent profane or not keeping him with cta's image and thus disqualified
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:59.320]   She laura had a company's founder
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:07.880]   Said this is an obvious double standard when it comes to sexuality and sexual health while there are sex and sexual health products at ces
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:10.360]   It seems the ces
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.320]   applies the rules differently for companies and products based on the gender of their
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:18.680]   Customers is what you were talking about jeff mens the issue men's sexuality is allowed to be explicit
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:24.920]   With with well, there's for instance a literal sex robot in the shape of an unrealistically proportioned woman
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:32.120]   And vr porn in point of pride along the aisle female sexuality on the other hand is heavily muted if not outright
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.680]   band she has a point
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.680]   See
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.720]   saying oh wasn't it was a moral but it didn't fit the category which is worse because they're
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:46.840]   That's not what they said. It's in writing that they said it was immoral. So I was not raising this to be
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:52.760]   Perient, period. No, not at all. Yeah, I think there was there was an interesting issue here
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.200]   Meanwhile, there's the self-driving suitcases
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:02.520]   If anybody gets near me one of those in Newark airport, I'm I'm kicking it useful
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.400]   Do you not feel that what we are seeing from ces is exactly what we've seen in years past that there is nothing? Yes
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.760]   Absolute this is just there. I know we saw that
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:17.560]   Lus suitcase last year. Oh yeah in the year before
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:25.160]   It's just oh and now this is oh, this is what gets me by the way. He's not at ces
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:29.960]   I just want to point this out. This is my biggest problem with ces. You guys know about this
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.080]   He's at one of the pre show showstoppers
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:36.360]   So all the products you'll see
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.960]   Because everybody's on deadline and they want it and they're hurrying they're lazy and they like right?
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.880]   Are at these pre events where companies pay $10,000 in more?
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.680]   There are small subset of the bigger companies. There's hundreds of thousands of booths to see yes
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:55.400]   There's there's a hundred at this event, but they feed you and almost all the coverage comes from these
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:58.600]   Mini expos and that's what this is
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:06.920]   Just a few weird tech products. We saw at ces at 2019 at showstoppers or pepcom whichever it is
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.480]   They are weird
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   This is this is that toilet
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.000]   Um
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.080]   Actually, this is from I know I'm confused this has branding all over it from the late show
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:25.160]   And oh, I here's Colbert talking about it. I get it the echo powered toilet
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.880]   Now he's on the show floor. I think now he's wandering the halls
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:33.160]   This is just a full hotel there. Yeah, yeah
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:41.320]   Uh, so what about the um the folding tv screen leon saw it last year any interest that was a little g showed it last year
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:46.520]   They did yes this year. They're saying but we're gonna ship it sometime this year
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:51.080]   This is not new we saw it last year
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:58.200]   And they act as if oh this we saw last year the forward ex ovis suitcase that walks around behind you
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.000]   There's there's valor
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.840]   trained cricket
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.840]   Which is a dumb idea by the way
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.320]   Well, I don't know is it
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:13.720]   I think so you don't get in the way. You don't want a suitcase that follows you around no because i'm trying to get around that guy
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.760]   I'm trying that guy is pissing me off and it do work
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.440]   And then you come to the stairs or the escalator and then it's just there are suitcase man
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.800]   Now maybe i'm confusing with this with the one that you can ride around the airport. Oh, yeah, i've seen that one
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.400]   Uh
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.600]   That one got banned in airports people. Oh, yeah, people
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.920]   People apparently didn't want you ride around in the airport at 13 miles an hour on your
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.440]   student of a bunch of uh
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.600]   bunch airlines a band the ones that have
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:47.080]   Phone chargers in them. Well, yeah, no, you can't in fact this is very frustrating in fact one of our sponsors some some time ago away
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:53.000]   Remember made bags that have batteries in them and they're great. I love my away bag, but you can't check it
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:00.200]   Yeah, yeah, you can only either be caring. So now all of these new battery bags have removable batteries, which if you ask me is no different
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.040]   Than just carrying a battery. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.560]   Yeah, it's again. Take it on my suitcase and put it in my backpack, which was where it was going to be anyway. Oh
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:15.320]   Plus by the way for my my you know now old fashioned pixel 2x
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:21.320]   Um, I never carry chargers anymore. It keeps it. It's fine. I'm good finally
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.680]   First place for the case. You don't play pokemon go
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.440]   True I do not
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.040]   I do not
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.280]   I actually have now invested in we have a
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.920]   Beautiful charging station built for me by the wood whisperer
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:43.400]   It's loaded with portable battery packs so that we can just grab and go one grab and go
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.880]   Playpokey mango. I uh, I paid on kickstarter
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:53.880]   I think it was two years ago and it arrived two days ago and I was like what is this
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.280]   What is this? It happens to you a lot a lot
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.240]   Uh, it says when you pledge that it will arrive November 2017
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:09.080]   I think they missed that date, but I did just get it. This is samsara the world's first aluminum smart suitcase
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.800]   Among among its many I did buy it and I do have it now
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:22.360]   No, yeah among its many uh features are the fact that it's got amazing creation it begins with the clash of oh my god
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.160]   It just goes this got a battery in it right? It's got a battery in it
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.240]   And you feel so embarrassing and the battery powers leds
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:34.280]   Uh, so that when you oh this is the other feature. It's got a flat top
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.440]   So you could put your laptop on it at the airport and it's just like a desk
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.040]   Nice
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.480]   It is aluminum
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:44.440]   They as they say the same material that airplanes are made out of
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.000]   Um, and it has an app. It's the first luggage I've ever used that has an app
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   And the app's chief purpose seems to be to let you know if somebody steals your suitcase
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.160]   Right to track it. Yeah
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:00.520]   Doesn't track it exactly. It's a separation monitor because once they got it and it has a port power bank
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.040]   But you have to take it out
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.040]   And it looks exactly like the ones I bought
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.320]   So I don't know what the advantages of it. Anyway, I did I feel like I didn't miss anything at se
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.320]   Yes, it feels like it's just more of the same
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.280]   Are we in just an amazing?
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:17.320]   Plateau
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.400]   I think in a way we are
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.560]   Yeah, I took the things that we get delivered or get delivered by things like boys
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.520]   Yeah, here's some pretty good news
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:29.960]   And autonomous robo was just gonna
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.760]   By itself driving Tesla
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.920]   I'm just gonna mention that. I'm sure that was an accident, right?
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:43.720]   Uh, it was in vegas sunday night at ses a number of engineers
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:48.280]   We're moving these robots to a display booth getting ready for ses
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.560]   It was a v4 model from promo bot
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:57.160]   These are basically random for $2,000 a day to get people to come to your booth
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.640]   Uh
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.160]   After sunday's collision the firm revealed one of their creations had been killed
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.680]   As the robots made their way to the booth around 7 p.m
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:13.480]   It's straight out of lining into the parking lot roadway where it was struck by a model s Tesla
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.440]   Car was in autonomous mode
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:22.600]   And the model s people could hear it's screaming robots because there can be only one
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:29.080]   Oh the insanity
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.720]   I just that's too perfect
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.720]   That's the problem. It's too perfect
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:40.440]   Too luckily your autonomous toilet king go out in the road and get hit by a car. So you're probably safe
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.000]   So we've had in the past
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.560]   Um
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:50.280]   Those spit test dna companies we had 23 and most recently had tealix
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.960]   Um
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.760]   There has been a kerfuffle a big news story and I don't know if I this worries me at all
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.040]   But i'm gonna run up by you guys 23 and me just did a deal
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.360]   300 million dollar deal with glak glaxo smith cline. Yeah
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:08.120]   They took a big stake they bought a bunch a chunk of it
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   Yeah, the concern people have is that in fact
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:20.440]   Glaxo smith cline admits it that they will use the genetic data in at 23 means database to look for new drugs to develop
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.200]   That's why it's worth 300 million dollars to them. That makes total sense to me
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:28.440]   It will also use the genetic data to inform how patients are selected for clinical trials
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.280]   To me as long as the data is anonymous
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:39.880]   Yeah, who cares? You know what I go in and I answer every single question the 23 and me asked me to
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:46.200]   Yeah, it might be a really important data. Think about all the stuff you could learn about
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.560]   You know lesser known diseases or genetic
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.040]   Difficulties, how are you gonna do research into that if you don't have the data?
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:01.000]   You do sign I didn't notice this when I and I did 23 and me years ago. I did helix more recently
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.640]   You do sign a thing called bio banking consent
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:11.480]   That tells 23 and me that they can keep your spit for up to 10 years
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.800]   That's a fun warehouse
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.880]   So do you consent to them owning the rights to whatever they develop?
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:24.520]   Well, I should have read it more carefully. You can
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.400]   Ask them to delete your spit
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.120]   But yeah, there was a
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.160]   Yeah
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.280]   About
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.360]   China member, um, henry and elax do you remember that story? Yeah, the hela
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:44.280]   Gene that's a that's a shameful story fascinating story yet her genes were used and are still used
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:50.520]   Without her consent permission or even knowledge because she was african-american there's a standard like those genes are like
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.000]   That's the standard. Yeah
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:00.760]   So it's shameful that they abused the kind of used her, but at the same time it's been hugely valuable for research. Yes, so I don't you know
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.000]   This is I think there's a point at which we say that there is a greater good
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.160]   And we haven't figured out how to deal with that yet when it comes to data and information
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.560]   But it's a discussion that we have to have and and and and the reflex response cannot be
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.280]   Share nothing with anyone
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.080]   We have to balance
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.560]   Helix tosses your spit upon request
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.240]   But we'll keep the can keep the data forever
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.880]   I want a video story. Welcome world's largest spitware house
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:34.920]   Ancestry which also does this says we do not will not sell dna
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:42.280]   Without your explicit consent you have to opt in and you can revoke permission. I think that's the case with all three of these
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.960]   You know, I I don't know I guess in fact when we do it when we do the ads
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:55.480]   For both companies people often in the chat room, especially will say I don't know, you know, I don't know if I want to give these guys my dna
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.640]   Uh, and it's you know, I mean it's true that at least right now it's
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:07.320]   For the most part just an amusement because although both 23 me and helix are going to do uh, braca testing
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.320]   Which is a breast cancer gene that is
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:16.600]   Considered by many to be a strong indicator of a future chance of getting but you only get that if you specifically specifically say
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.840]   I want you have to buy it. I think in some cases not to mention there's been at least a couple of cases now
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.200]   I think where police departments have been able to track down
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:31.240]   Okay, you know criminal there was a case in california because of their relationships to people in the database a long dead cold case
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.800]   They got the guy but it wasn't
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:38.600]   This was a weird one. It wasn't they didn't go to 23 and me or helix or anybody
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.280]   There was there's a genetic forum where people share their genetic information
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:48.200]   Intentionally and his relatives had they had a dna sample from some of the murders
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:54.520]   And they were able to figure out these must be the relatives of the criminal and they were able to catch them guy that way
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.000]   So prison yeah, that may be a
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.800]   For warning of something that may be happening down the road in less palatable ways
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.640]   But I mean there again you've got a kind of slippery slope problem. It would be good to catch
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:14.760]   Killers it would be good to catch people who are guilty of horrible crimes
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.760]   but
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.760]   It would be bad if say
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:23.240]   Your insurance company got ahold of some information that they used against you
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:28.600]   This seems to be a conversation we have a lot on this show is you know, the these trade-offs
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.400]   Yeah, yeah, if Stacy were here, she'd have a different view
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:34.600]   Yeah
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:38.840]   I don't know. What do you think should I call uh helix in 23 me and say get rid of my spit
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:44.280]   I don't know. I want you to I want you to revert it into an ink for my fountain pen
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.480]   Ooh, that's a very good idea that when I get an idea. I'll be giving a dna sample
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:56.520]   Lea wink my daughter. That's a cool idea years ago when my nabi was like eight and I took her to an autograph signing
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.800]   Which she thought was the strangest thing she'd ever seen if you lined up to meet her dad
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.120]   I knew an autograph and take pictures. She said why don't you just give them a vial of your spit
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:08.600]   Now I know she was prescient. She was right. Yeah
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.240]   Um
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.880]   It was hard for one of that container though since you gotta get enough spit in it. So you've done it a lot of spit
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.120]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're not worried about it
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.120]   I know for the one where they
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.360]   They publicly tell and your hurt they didn't take you. Yeah, the personal genome project
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.080]   I thought this was a real it was MIT. It was a really good idea
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:32.520]   You pay that the time was thousands of dollars for the genetic assay and then you answer all their questions
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.120]   And they they said we can't promise it'll stay private. So we're gonna use your name
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.320]   And I wanted to do this to Dyson did I wanted to do it
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.400]   I
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.400]   But somebody pointed out and this is the other side of this
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:48.120]   Your dna isn't just yours. My kids have some of my dnh
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.280]   So I had this discussion with ester
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.280]   In fact, and I said well ester. I I don't know now. I've had prostate cancer
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.440]   You know, everybody's gonna know my sons and she said oh get over it. Jeff. Everybody gets prostate cancer
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.880]   Well, that's true. You get old enough if you're a man and if you live long enough
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:04.680]   That's true. You're a prostate cancer. You just unfortunately got it young
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:08.360]   Relatively
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.040]   But there he looks is gonna do APOE which is an Alzheimer's
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:15.560]   Part of the problem is that these markers
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:20.440]   Are not definitive that you will get it. There's a percentage
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.320]   It's a percentage and it has to do with nature and nurture
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.840]   It's the gene that also environment that expresses it and to be fair
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.680]   They do do a pretty good job of explaining explaining they make it very clear
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.160]   This does not mean you're getting x
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:39.000]   Right, but that's the other story in the rundown which is interesting was that AI has I think it was google AI
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.240]   beat
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:46.520]   Diagnoses of Alzheimer's and brain scans by six years. It was better than humans reading the brain scans
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:51.320]   In other words, the google AI was able to see that somebody was likely to get Alzheimer's
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:55.800]   Long before six years before a doctor would have diagnosed it
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.640]   In fact did diagnose it because they this was a longitudinal study and all time is
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.200]   Notorious is difficult to diagnose
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:08.920]   In fact the number one test to confirm whether you have Alzheimer's was done after death
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:13.800]   Right, so they could only confirm at 100% after you die and they look at your brain
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:20.760]   Yes, that's what's really interesting about this right? They had the samples. Yeah, what was interesting about this too to me is that
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:23.320]   You can't query
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.760]   The algorithm and say well, how do you know that? What what should we look for?
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:33.320]   Right? There's there's correlations that it figured out that become knowledge that it can't express and we don't know
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:41.000]   That's we're gonna have to all get used to that. That's that alpha zero is the future of knowledge. Yeah, these ais don't
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.960]   Uh, expressible rules. We're used to rule based logic and programming
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:47:07.820]   Al
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:11.660]   Artificial intelligent able to detect Alzheimer's does not mean it's conscious
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:18.780]   It doesn't mean it has mind and he says there's no real we don't know but there's no real evidence that
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:25.020]   This this path one turns into the other right? We don't know how how intelligence becomes mine
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:30.300]   We don't know what our mind is and we don't and it there's no evidence that it's gonna as you get you know
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:36.940]   Google assistant gets smarter and smarter at some point it'll become conscious. That's a that's a different process entirely I think
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:43.020]   So get make I AI better. That's okay. They're just gonna be passive machines better tools
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:47.740]   Yes, but that's fine. Yeah, that's fine
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:51.820]   And by the time it becomes conscious, it'll be too late anyway
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:48:03.340]   The deep learning algorithm and so this is again one of those cases. This is a study published in radiology at ccsf not google
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:06.300]   uh, what what's interesting is
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:07.980]   um
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:11.980]   The deep learning algorithm achieved 82 percent specificity
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:16.620]   at 100 sensitivity predicting patients final diagnosis
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:20.460]   after by radiological readers after death
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.340]   And on average the algorithm learned
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:29.180]   Six years sooner 75.8 months more than six years prior to the diagnosis
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:33.420]   And as you say this is one of those cases where it's trained
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:36.860]   Makes its own rules. We don't know what those rules are
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:42.860]   Right and they can the more data we give it the better it will be and the better will you know, and of course the problem
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.260]   I was you can't treat Alzheimer's, but at some point
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:50.780]   There will be a front neighbor of mine. Um, well, no look at better example Ruth better Ginsburg
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:53.500]   Right and god god bless get better with
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.660]   um
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:49:02.460]   But uh, they were caught her lung cancer early because she also fell and they took a scan right just chance by chance
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:07.740]   It's the chance and if you there are certain things that if you do uh front neighbor of mine has god bless them
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:13.500]   Um, pancreatic cancer. We thought okay. Well, that's it because you always hear that's it, but by chance it was diagnosed early
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:20.220]   Yeah, that's the key earlier you find out and I think that's true even with Alzheimer's that there are treatments as you can do
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:23.020]   I mean you may not stop it, but you can slow it. Yeah
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:27.660]   I love this story new statesman stop scaremongering
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:31.100]   About kids spending time in their phones
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:36.220]   We of course are constantly worried surrounded by
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:43.500]   as uh, as the new statesman writes doom laden warnings about how smartphones have destroyed a generation
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.940]   But the evidence is very weak royal college of pediatrics and child health
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:52.220]   issued new stream screen time guidelines
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:50:00.300]   Saying essentially there's no evidence no evidence to support the idea that screen time is directly toxic to health
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:05.260]   There is some evidence it can displace other activities like exercise
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:11.340]   But the main recommendations now this is of the uk's royal college of pediatrics and child health
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:18.220]   Simply ask yourselves as a family whether your screen time is controlled or whether it gets in the way of doing things you want to do
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:21.100]   And if it does try to control
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:25.980]   Right leah when I you and I grew up at the time matthew's a little younger right? I think matthew aren't you?
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:32.700]   Yeah a little bit yeah a little bit but but we grew up in a time when the same discussion was made about television
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:38.620]   Oh, yeah, right my parents will only let me watch 30 minutes a night of tv and i'll never forgive them for that
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:40.220]   Yeah
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.220]   Yeah, 30 minutes a night
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:47.340]   We didn't have to be limited because we only got three channels and one was french so
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:51.740]   And the rest was boring
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:56.380]   I'll never forget that night where my parents said we're going out to dinner
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:00.060]   And it was the premiere of adam west's batman
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:07.260]   And I knew I know I knew you were gonna miss it the next day in fourth grade. That's all anybody be talking about
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:14.620]   All anybody be talking about and I was gonna miss it and I had any I know chris funny you should mention that I just saw a clip
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:19.100]   I think it was on facebook and it was uh, it was um
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:22.220]   amalgamation of all the
[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:29.660]   Wall walking celebrity. Yes. Um, I saw that recently too. It was it was hilarious
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:35.180]   That was the cheesiest show and I by the way enjoyed it absolutely
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:46.940]   Oh man, what a great show god. It was what I mean it reveled in its cheesiness. It was intentionally. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, holy cheesy batman
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:54.220]   Yes, it is. But don't be alarmed. We're here. Yes, this is business. Holy human flies
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:59.580]   And by the way, it's so obvious they're walking the camera side was
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:02.540]   I know you
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.540]   Unless new in god, I'm saying
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:11.180]   Is from philadelphia. Did you know you dipped your dip on people from philadelphia or non-fiction
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:16.060]   Where batman robin a crime fighters. Are you a vocal group?
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:22.460]   Stick client value party. I thought you might be a singing duo. You know the the outfits in all that
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:25.340]   No, we're duly deputized officers of the law
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:28.140]   You may return to your business citizen
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:31.820]   It was so cheesy
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:38.700]   Yeah, god was it but I was right everybody in fourth grade was talking about it and you were left out. I was left out
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.260]   There's the green hornet
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:48.780]   It was so good. It was so good. You remember that. So maybe you are of a certain age. Oh, yeah. No, I definitely remember
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:53.100]   There's another there's a twitter account and all it does is post
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:53:00.140]   Images of the goofy things with goofy labels from that batman show
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:01.980]   So there was always
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:08.620]   You know a secret device and it had this huge sign on it with some dumb name and all it does is tweet those images
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:13.180]   Uh, if you thought there were too many shows on tv to watch
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:17.660]   I wish I were limited to half an hour. You were right. You were right netflix
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:24.540]   Released over 1500 hours of original series and movies this year amazing the investment is just a gigantic
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:26.780]   year
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:29.580]   And it's actually I think it's it's accelerated this year
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:33.660]   I think so too. I keep between amazon prime net
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:35.180]   What was that?
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.380]   Hulu
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:38.380]   Yeah, I don't know
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.620]   I missed it maniac
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:42.620]   No, it was rainy act, huh?
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:45.980]   Is that Emma Emma what's her name is stone?
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:50.220]   Yeah, Emma's phone like her. See I love those two people. I didn't even know they were in a show
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:54.380]   This happened to me this happens to me all the time, but it happened to me watching
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:56.700]   The golden gloat
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:54:01.660]   So they would mention a show that had been on for multiple seasons
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:07.100]   Yes with famous people in it and be like I have literally never not only have I not seen it
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.340]   I've never heard of it. I
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:11.340]   Don't even know it exists
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:14.380]   By share of total minutes 66 percent were series
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:17.100]   11 percent documentary 10 percent movies
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:23.420]   5 percent kids 3 percent anime 3 I thought they were all stand-up comedy specials, but only 3 percent
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:25.180]   Yeah
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:27.980]   Please the way that's the problem with netflix's personalizations
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:31.580]   There's just stuff that I I would be interested in they don't show me. I never seen any act
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:37.020]   I didn't even know it existed never heard right same here fact netflix all right. Let's let's acknowledge it is the worst
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:41.340]   Software, I know it's a little different on every platform, but all I want to do is go back to the show
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:45.820]   I was watching last night. Yeah, yeah, good luck finding it. I want you to do that, but
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.100]   They want you to scroll
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:51.180]   No, no, just you know
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:56.380]   Just the first thing should be this is what you were watching last. Yeah, that's all
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:55:00.860]   They're all awful HBO. I can't I've got on the same episode of of
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:03.900]   The affair a hundred times because I can't remember where I was
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:07.980]   And that's a problem with that show because they're all the same you can't tell anyway. Yes, whiny
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:12.220]   I cannot I've tried to watch that show. I watched the first season
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:15.660]   I couldn't believe how many seasons they get out of that
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:21.740]   There's about the fifth of last the longest affair in history. I know it got better. This is crazy
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:29.900]   You know you were you were mentioning the screen time sort of moral panic. Yeah, I actually wrote about that for a
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:36.540]   For cdr in passing, but I noted that the doll maker american girl
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:42.620]   Yeah, it's new girl of the year doll for 2019. Yeah is an aspiring chef
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:45.260]   Who runs a bed and breakfast
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:51.020]   But who also needs help quote finding balance between the digital world and the real world? Oh wow
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:55.500]   My daughter was big into american girl dolls when oh, yeah
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.660]   Same here. Is this the truly the truly me doll?
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:04.460]   It's the girl of the year. I don't know if the they so they announced it
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:09.100]   I guess a week or two ago. That's interesting. She's an aspiring chef
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:15.820]   They all have stories and they they started with historical dolls, which is really I used to read the books to my daughter
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:18.860]   Yeah, they were actually pretty good. I
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:23.020]   Did I tell you this I took abbey to chicago to the american girl doll
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:29.100]   Oh, we've done that too. Oh, yeah, we went to a chicago cubs game and I was sitting I and my buddy
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:36.540]   And our two young daughters. I he and I were sitting in the bleachers at the cubs game with our with their american girl dolls and our laps
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:42.860]   Now just had a picture of that. Oh, I wish you'd been on the jumbo drawing with that. Yeah, that'd be on the internet. That was fun
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:46.620]   There was also I also mentioned in passing this study
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.060]   um
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:50.060]   A psychologist pointed out that
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:53.180]   um one of the pro these green time
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:57.260]   Studies with most of the research is that relies on self reporting
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:04.940]   Yes, and this one did people are notoriously bad. Yeah, that estimating their own usage. I think honestly if we if we think about
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:11.500]   Our experience but I have a teenagers at home. I have adult kids
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:19.100]   It's clear that that is a problem that there is an issue and sure I don't know what the long-term result will be like
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.300]   Are they gonna?
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:24.620]   I'm not actually my adult kids kind of missed out. Uh abbey is born in 92 henry in 94
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:29.820]   They kind of missed out but michael 16 and he's in you know completely soaking in it
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:37.420]   Uh, and maybe that's one of the reasons tim swiney the founder of the developer fortnight made seven
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:41.260]   Billi a billion dollars this year with a b. Yeah
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:48.700]   Well, and and I read an actually an interesting in our article. I can't remember where I wish I could but about how fortnight
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:53.900]   Is a great game and everything but it's also a social community exactly
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:59.660]   That's a secret. It's like second life. It's a place to go and hang out and do stuff. It's not just a game
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:04.060]   Have you played I haven't I haven't got anywhere near it. I mean usually yes. They go you put both of it
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:05.740]   Yeah
[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:12.220]   Uh, it's absolutely about the social it's absolutely about the social which is really interesting. We had a a game
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:17.020]   Expert she does consulting for game companies has done it for years
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:22.540]   And and she has a map of the four quadrants that every game has to appeal to
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:28.620]   One of them is social. You know, they also has to be a reward system and and yeah a certain amount of challenge
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:29.020]   Etc
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:32.060]   There are these it's actually quite interesting to read a lot of companies
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:36.860]   Hire her because she's kind of figured out the psychology of gamifying remember her name
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:41.020]   Um, you know what john her chart is on the uh, is on the wall
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:43.340]   uh over on the left
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:47.820]   Uh in my at the back of my office there and we could I at all get it for you. She's great
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:51.260]   It was a good triangulation cars to my remember he was one of booked it
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:55.020]   But uh, but anyway, it's a fascinating subject fortnight
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:59:00.620]   And I was talking with the other day with a friend of buddy of mine whose kid is a fortnight addict
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:06.380]   He says the greatest thing ever because he uses it as a reward system and he can get this kid to do anything to do end
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:09.340]   He cleaned the house the other day
[01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:15.180]   I think that's illegal. I shouldn't be but the kid gladly and willing he does this is okay
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:20.140]   You could play for it. So this is the four keys to fun. Her name, uh is nichole
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:22.860]   Lizz, uh lizzaro. I think
[01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:26.860]   Um and her uh company is zio design xeo design
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:31.580]   And she actually publishes on there. So there's hard fun easy fun
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:37.580]   Serious fun people fun and the way this is designed they all feed into one another
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:40.300]   So with the people fun
[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:45.180]   Communicate cooperate compete. It's got to be there and it generates the emotions
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:48.940]   She calls, uh, amici or friendship amusement
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:56.300]   Amero and admiration. It's really interesting very thoughtful. It's a good uh triangulation hard for the follow
[01:59:56.300 --> 02:00:01.900]   A game researcher named jane mcdonald. Oh jane mcdonald's great. I love her. Yeah, she's amazing
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:05.500]   She's talked a lot. I've heard her speak. She's talked a lot about the gamification of everything
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:07.020]   Um
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:11.580]   in any event fortnight is one of those unicorns one of those once in a you know in a
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:17.660]   Decade things that just kind of got magically got everything right. It's not an original concept
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:20.620]   They kind of stole it from a player unknowns battleground
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:22.220]   Billions
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:25.740]   Uh, they but they cartoonized it which they kind of stole from overwatch
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:29.100]   They added the social element. It was a little bit of overwatch
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:33.340]   They they they don't charge for the game. The game is free
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:37.580]   All the money is made on costumes and dance moves
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:42.140]   They're being sued by the way by the number of people including was his name carlton
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:44.380]   from
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:47.180]   Fresh prince for stealing the carlman. Oh, right. Yeah
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.140]   Oh, I didn't know the guy who
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:54.380]   Developed and also created the unreal engine. Yeah. Yeah, sweetie's
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:01:01.340]   Basically epic games. He found it in his basement his parents. Wow because the unreal engine is behind everything. Yeah
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:04.540]   Well, if you think about it in
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:05.980]   1991
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.220]   He's playing games in his parents basement
[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:12.860]   You know his mom said what are you gonna do play video games for a living for a living?
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:17.180]   I hope he's bought her something nice. Yeah
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.620]   A house of a basement
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.380]   Wow
[02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:26.700]   I have breaking. I have breaking news. I'm breaking news. It's just in. Oh, it's just in
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:29.180]   Seth mask it
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:29.660]   tweets
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:36.620]   I'm inspired by the bravery of the person who insisted on anonymity when revealing what kind of candy trump offered Pelosi and Schumer
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:38.780]   CNN quote
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:42.060]   The exact candy was not specified but according to a source familiar
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:46.540]   At least one butter fingers was spotted as well as baby Ruth bars and m&m's
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.540]   This is the book
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.620]   He brought them the leftover white house
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:53.180]   Halloween candy ball
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:57.820]   Well, they love fingers are good. I like butter. I gotta get rid of it somehow
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:01.340]   I'd vote I'd vote for a wall if he gave me butter fingers. I'm easy
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.620]   I want to know where they peed at m&m's or not. Oh
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:11.180]   So we'll end with this list. It wasn't supposed to be published
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:17.100]   We can't set it to journalists saying specifically you may not publish this
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:21.340]   But Emma blogger Emma best has released it
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:23.820]   um
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.820]   This is the
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:28.300]   Complete list of the 140 things
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:33.580]   It would be false and defamatory to say about Julian Assange
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:38.540]   And it is uh, you know some of the things you know
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:41.420]   You could kind of
[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:46.380]   It's false and defamatory to suggest he ever met with or communicated with George cattrell
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:48.540]   And they you know to their credit they give links here
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:55.660]   So some of this is exactly what you'd expect the accusations having to do with mannefort and cattrell, but you also can't say
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:58.700]   Uh
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:01.100]   That he has bad hygiene
[02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:07.900]   Uh, he stinks that he lives in a cupboard under the stairs
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:15.260]   That's a joke right that's a harry potter joke, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure he jokes anymore
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:23.900]   Each sentence begins of the of the 140 with it is false and defamatory to suggest that is that some sort of
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:29.580]   quasi-pseudo legalism saying i'll sue your ass if you say this yeah
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:35.500]   It addresses it is false and defamatory
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:39.420]   Suggest suggests that Assange is merely a guest of the Ecuadorian embassy
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:43.820]   He's a political refugee
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:46.540]   Anyway, uh, wow
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:48.860]   I don't I don't even
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:53.180]   Yeah, you should skip over the really serious stuff because the really good stuff is further down
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:56.220]   Yeah
[02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:59.660]   There's a lot of it. These are a lot. These are all things
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:03.980]   Uh, it's false to say he was a member of a cult or his mom
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:06.540]   It's false to say he bleaches his hair
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:10.380]   No, that's that's his natural color. It is false. Mom was a hippie
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:14.220]   Yeah, you may not suggest that julie nessanj's mother is or ever was a hippie
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:17.340]   Or that he is a hacker
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.340]   Can't say it
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:25.260]   It is false and defamatory to suggest that he ever walked into embassy meeting rooms in his underwear never did that
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:28.060]   I have no idea where you got the idea
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:32.220]   Uh, it's false and defamatory
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:35.900]   Suggested Ecuador suggested that julie nessanj did not look after his cat
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:39.980]   He has never neglected an animal
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:42.700]   And then there's a whole list of
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:48.940]   Things you can't call him anarchist racist anti-semit misogynist pita file rapist murderer communist
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:52.300]   I the lady does protest too much me thinks
[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:56.380]   I would never suggest that he stinks
[02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:04.860]   We never suggest that he does not use cutlery that he's ever lived in a basement cupboard or under the stairs. I would never
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:10.220]   Never would suggest that julie and don't worry you're safe with me
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:16.540]   Why do we how do we stand on that julie nessanj these days do we do we really know
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:19.420]   What's going on there?
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:23.900]   Something's going on. We just don't know what's going on. The problem for us in journalism is is you know, we
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:29.740]   We have to defend speech and publication, but it's really hard to defend
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:36.380]   And yet I mean some of the things that he did. I mean, we wouldn't have known about that drone. Oh, that's exactly right strikes
[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:42.620]   And personally I defended wicki leagues in the early early days. I certainly did as a journalistic organization
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:48.140]   And it just pained me to no end to see what has become
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:52.220]   Of what was once a powerful
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:57.980]   And arguably positive thing. It's just I don't even is it
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:05.500]   That he has committed the heresy of supporting Donald trump is that now
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:10.140]   Defacto, you know, it's not as simple as that is
[02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:12.060]   40
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:14.060]   It's that same that he helped
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:16.620]   Manipulated american election
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:20.060]   The pedestrian emails and so on he was he was he was an agent
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:26.140]   That's the issue and I think he was a waiting agent or he's think he was an unwitting agent. Oh, yeah
[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:27.740]   No, I think he was deliberate
[02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:31.180]   Notice how how the the two efforts are from the left
[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:37.100]   To use fake news manipulation in the alabama election is receiving condemnation from the left
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.340]   Yeah, rightly so
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:40.620]   Yes
[02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:45.980]   So it's no, it's not it's about what he did. Honestly who he did it for the fact who he did it for our bonus points, but
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:48.380]   and even what he did that
[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:50.460]   I spoke to
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:54.220]   former members of wicki leaks who worked closely with julien assage
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:56.940]   and they both said
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:01.740]   That they stepped away from the organization because it became all about julien
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:04.140]   and it was all about his kind of
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:06.460]   conspiracy theories and
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:07.900]   So they
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:12.860]   It stopped being about what they thought it was originally about we were recent work conversations
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:13.340]   Matthew. Yes
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:19.740]   Worried after he spoke truth to power about the drone strikes and other things that that he was his name was mud
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:23.900]   And know whatever whatever it took that the the the
[02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:27.980]   Governments in the united states and other countries would get him
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:32.540]   The system they would get him and and I think this is them getting him
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:35.660]   Some of his paranoia is is definitely justified
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:41.100]   But there are lots of things that he's done to himself. Yeah that have not been done to him
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:44.780]   Yeah
[02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:45.820]   so
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:47.980]   And more breaking news. Oh, we're breaking news
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.620]   previous break baby Ruth
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:55.740]   Uh, well kind of so m&m's has three new internationally inspired flavors. Oh
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:59.580]   Thai coconut peanut it's in the run. I put it in the comments
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:03.980]   English toffee peanut, but here's the real news. Here's the scoop. Here's the big deal
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:09.820]   Mexican jalapeno peanut m&m that'd be funny if he brought that to the what do we think
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:13.100]   Well, it's like it didn't come from mexico. I'm gonna say no
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.820]   No, you think no to jalapeno peanut m&m's
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:21.660]   No, you pass more of a traditional it has finally happened and then we're gonna wrap this up with your picks
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:27.340]   It has finally happened a 51% attack against a cryptocurrency
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:34.700]   Yeah, ethereum classic. Yeah, unfortunately, it's not bitcoin, but it does raise the concern that you know
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:37.740]   Some of them bigger
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:40.620]   More I don't know is ethereum classic an important
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.820]   Not really. What is the 51% attack being?
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:46.620]   Well, all I know I learned from silicon valley
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:53.660]   Someone getting your to control of the token. Oh, I see it turns out that this is something that nobody ever really contemplated
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:55.900]   but if if if you could
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:09:03.580]   Control a sufficient number of blocks in a blockchain you could take it over. Yeah, you could make it yours
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:08.860]   And that's what happened with ethereum classic
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:16.140]   So coinbase has halted all ethereum classic transactions withdrawals and deposits if you have ethereum classic
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:19.740]   I don't know what that means. Is it is the money out of your hands? I don't know
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:26.140]   I got the impression people were moving away from ethereum classic anyway. Like that's why it's called classic right
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:30.540]   Like coke ethereum was one of the big egyptos, right?
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:35.500]   It still is yeah, there's different branches or forks or
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:41.420]   So do you gents still think that there's something left in cryptocurrency or is it all turned out to be a
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:44.700]   I definitely do fad I definitely do
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:49.020]   I mean, maybe i'm wrong, but I I remember how skeptical
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:53.020]   People were about the internet and I remember how skeptical they were about
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:59.100]   Lots of technologies that wound up being pretty transformative and I think in the early days you often see
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.180]   The worst
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:07.260]   Sides of something like that. I mean you remember early websites even early social networks. They were garbage
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:08.940]   and
[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:15.500]   Lots of there's so much better. Yeah, so much better now. They're garbage fires. So you wouldn't know Leo
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.820]   You wouldn't know Leo
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:19.820]   I can smell it from here. Jeff mine now
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:23.020]   But you couldn't you couldn't argue they haven't affected our life
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:25.500]   You couldn't argue that they don't they aren't a big right
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:29.420]   You know that they obviously good and bad. It's not that it's going to be
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:34.540]   I agree with you. I think that's the case, but I but but boy the cooties are winning and
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:37.340]   Right now
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:42.060]   Yeah, I mean the part part of the problem is also a lot of cryptocurrencies are essentially pyramid schemes
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:48.220]   It seems like right I think right the fundamental technology of blockchain is fascinating. Oh, yeah, it is it is
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:50.540]   it's being
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:52.700]   theoretically applied to much
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:57.500]   But there are interesting applications the notion of a decentralized
[02:10:58.300 --> 02:11:00.300]   ledger system
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:06.940]   Is I think very powerful and I don't think well, I that's now part of the world. That's not going to go away
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:13.820]   Cryptocurrencies and especially I see o's. Okay. Yeah, so I think that's where you have to distinguish between blockchain
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:19.580]   Which is the sort of technology aspect and crypto currency, which is it's kind of frothy
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:22.060]   you know, yeah
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:26.060]   It's like those websites do remember the one where you could buy a tiny ad
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:32.940]   And the page was just full of like hundreds and hundreds of tiny tiny ads. Yeah, do you remember that one? Yeah, the
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:34.540]   million
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:36.540]   million points or whatever. Yeah, yeah
[02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:39.900]   That got a lot of money by the way
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:41.980]   Yeah
[02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:46.860]   But that's not you know the internet or the web or it's just
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:50.460]   a minor
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:51.660]   bubble
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:52.860]   It's yeah
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:55.260]   It is it's really I think it's very interesting, you know, I
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:12:01.180]   Think as soon as you see people speculating and stuff that then then you're gonna start to say well, that's that's not there it is
[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:05.340]   I mean, don't I was the same and that's the what is that called a million
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:08.460]   million dollar home page
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:13.100]   And sold out. Oh, yeah, he made a lot of money
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:16.540]   And really there was not someone there
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:19.980]   Someone would look at that say the webs a waste of time
[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:22.460]   Yeah
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:24.460]   The times of London thought it was worth buying
[02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:27.100]   Ah
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:30.060]   Well, that's what's so funny. What's friends what brands are
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:34.140]   What's the name? Why there? Why not?
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:37.820]   It's it reminds me of my favorite website of all time
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:41.740]   Which was lings cars calm
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:45.020]   guys
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:48.860]   This is such a good website
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:51.980]   If you haven't been go to lings cars calm, she's apparently
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:57.260]   But did we try to we try to get her on triangulation? I did we ever talked to her? I feel like we did
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:13:00.300]   I think we did
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:02.300]   Long time ago in the brick house
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:05.980]   Lings wings dot com. She is the number one
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:10.460]   Leaser of new and used cars in the UK and I guess she's gonna do
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:17.420]   Something else planes are nice lease airplanes. Yeah, it's just it. It's just this is inspired
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:20.940]   This is the ugliest site with animated
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:22.780]   jiggling and

[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:54.300]   Uh, we I'm pretty sure we interviewed her
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:58.620]   I hope so maybe wasn't an interview. We just talked to her
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:01.420]   She was wearing a yellow
[02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:03.660]   emergency jacket or something
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:07.100]   Some crazy the tech guy 1534
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:13.180]   No, that was me talking about it, but maybe we never recorded it. We may not have made a show about it
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:19.980]   Uh, okay. Did we get everything in here? I think that what what did I miss anything fellows?
[02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:22.380]   Anything
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.740]   Is a million laying man. You kind of hit the that's the end of the internet
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:32.940]   Our show today brought we're gonna get your picks if we can come up with more
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.540]   Are you have it?
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:38.780]   We've used quite a few of them our show today brought to you by this is a great pick digital ocean
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:42.860]   Which is a fantastic platform for people who want to do web apps
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:44.620]   Uh
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:47.500]   Learn about web apps too because it's very affordable
[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:51.660]   Uh lots of businesses about 150,000 businesses rely on digital ocean
[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:55.740]   For their infrastructure used to be in the old days. I remember um
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:15:02.540]   Kevin rose when he started dig I remember he was so excited because they got a colo
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:06.460]   Which meant a network operation center. He bought his server
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.540]   They brought it to the physical fenced in cage in the colo
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:12.380]   colocation
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:17.260]   network operation center installed the software set up dig and that was just one server
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:21.660]   And he was so excited and that's what you had to do in those days if you had an idea like evan did
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:24.140]   For I got an idea for brilliant website
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:27.100]   That's what you had to do
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:30.860]   Then you know by the time we started twit I went to a company in texas
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:36.780]   And I said I need some servers. They provisioned them five days later. They get back to you your server is ready now
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:38.780]   You can set it up and I mean
[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:44.140]   This has become friction-free now and this is transformative in my opinion
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:49.020]   Digital ocean. It's the easiest cloud platform to deploy manage and scale applications
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:54.220]   With droplets those are virtual machines that are a scalable compute platform. You can add storage
[02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:56.700]   Security monitoring, you know what the best way for me
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:01.180]   This is my uh digital ocean page. Let me create a droplet show you how easy
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:05.900]   This is and so affordable too. So i'm going to say create a droplet
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:11.820]   Now the first thing that's going to happen is you can choose distribution so bunto free bsd fedora
[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.660]   Debian sent os you can also choose containers
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:20.860]   Which is a great way to do applications, but i'm gonna i'm gonna be really lazy and do the one click apps
[02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:26.940]   Are you interested in developing on a lamp stack right there? There's a lamp stack on bunto 18.04
[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:31.340]   You want to do python programming. Here's a jango framework my sql
[02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:32.860]   Plus
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:36.300]   WordPress docker git lab. Let's say you want to set up git lab. All right
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:41.660]   Now you choose how much you want to pay the droplets and and by the way it goes all the way down to five
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:46.060]   Dollars a month or point zero zero seven dollars. So that's what point seven cents an hour
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:48.700]   For that you get a gigabyte
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:55.340]   Of throughput you get a cpu 25 gigs of storage. I'm sorry you get a terabyte of transfer
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:17:01.020]   And uh, I guess there's a gigabyte of ram. So i'll choose that and if I need more it's easy to add more you want backups
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:03.100]   Yeah, let's enable backups as a buck a month
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:08.460]   Uh, i'm gonna choose you choose your data center New York san francisco amsterdam singapore london frangford toronto
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:14.140]   I'm gonna choose san francisco too. I always do I use ssh to log in see they already have my key
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:19.980]   So I don't even have to import that I could choose other features and I can name it. Let's call it leos
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:22.460]   git
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:23.340]   and
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:29.420]   Create it now remember when I said, you know, kevin had to go to a co-location install the hardware
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:32.700]   Days later. We are right now provisioning
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:40.860]   A entire git lab install that I can use with a public ip address if I want I can put my stuff on there
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:48.060]   I can manage dns. I could secure my droplets. I can add storage and this is going to get all set up and provisioned
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:50.460]   In the time it takes for me to do this ad
[02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:52.540]   That's digital ocean
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:56.860]   99.99 up time their sla cloud firewalls
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:17:59.660]   Monitoring and alerting so you always know the status
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:05.980]   Full dns management. They've got data centers as I said all over the world. These are using enterprise sst
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:12.940]   A very simple api and there you go leos git. It's at 206 189 that 71 to 46 is ready to go
[02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:16.700]   I can I can log into it right now on the console
[02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:20.780]   And play with it active you this is incredible
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:24.140]   Over 150,000 businesses
[02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:29.580]   Including some of the world's fastest growing startups rely on digital ocean see it's booting up
[02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:35.820]   Ah, there's my login. I'm running Ubuntu 1804 gets already installed. That is so awesome
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:39.020]   Do dot co slash twit
[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:41.740]   This
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:46.140]   You can see my usage fee in the right is zero because I don't have any droplets. I it's easy to destroy them
[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:48.060]   I'll let this one run
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:51.420]   It's not gonna cost me within five dollars a month and we're gonna make it even more affordable
[02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:55.580]   Because you're gonna get a free $100 credit when you go to do dot co slash twit
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:58.620]   That's that could be a whole year
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:01.980]   This is great for students if you want to learn a language
[02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:08.700]   And you know if you're using a Chromebook like jeff or a tablet you can log in you can use blink on an ipad
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:12.620]   Access your digital ocean account and do programming
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:17.180]   Run a wordpress blog do anything you want emax baby emax
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:24.940]   It's so great. I love it empowering the modern world of mvps
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:32.860]   Startups your next unicorn at dio dot co slash twit for a free hundred dollar credit would have been so much easier for kevin to start
[02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:39.420]   Dig and that's what I love about this. This is modern. They have kubernetes now by the way if you are interested in containers
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:42.860]   Uh, docker of course. It's just super
[02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:45.740]   dio dot co
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.740]   slash twit for a hundred dollar
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:50.140]   credit at digital ocean
[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:54.220]   I'm I am legitimately excited about dio because
[02:19:55.020 --> 02:19:59.100]   This is the kind of transformative technology that means anybody some kid in mumbai
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:02.380]   In high school could create the next big thing
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:04.300]   Yep
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:06.300]   So so great
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:08.940]   Jeff give us a number
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:15.420]   I have a number uh, so i found this interesting because moles are dying the seerus is dying
[02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:21.580]   I went to next stuff is dying. There's a mall in san erosa up here. There used to be huge cutting town moles where everybody went
[02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:23.660]   We went there the other day
[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:25.660]   Oh my god, it was depressing
[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:31.340]   Nothing there nothing there and the things that are there are fake stores, you know like with comic sands
[02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:37.740]   Signs right they're made up kind of like they bought it's like it's like it's like it going to an ebay store
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:40.700]   It's incredible. So sad
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:48.460]   So one mall however has found another life as one half million square foot mall plus in west l.a
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:51.340]   Is now going to be google's l.a. campus. Oh, there you go
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:56.060]   So I think it's a good use of a mall if we can think we can just put uh
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:21:02.140]   Uh big old tech companies and big old moles will be fine. It's not the first time reminds me of uh
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:05.500]   That reminds me of the san francisco chronicle
[02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:11.580]   Started renting out space to startups. Yeah. Yeah pretty soon the whole building was started. That's pretty funny
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:13.740]   Rackspace
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:17.420]   Is in a mall in uh san intonie perfect. Yeah, perfect. Yeah
[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:22.940]   I was thinking there's been college campuses. It's like like um, community colleges
[02:21:23.260 --> 02:21:27.100]   Such a great idea. Uh another is uh kind of an old folks home
[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:31.180]   Because of the mall becomes the you know the hill or walking the mall anyway now. It's downtown
[02:21:31.180 --> 02:21:37.260]   Uh, I know matthew. We probably use your uh your pick
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:39.740]   We did yeah
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:43.500]   I was just gonna say if you want to I still think people should go take a look
[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:49.260]   Um if they're interested in the internet archive. Yes, you can go to archive team.org
[02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:50.860]   um
[02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:52.300]   and you can
[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:54.700]   Install what they call the archive team warrior
[02:21:54.700 --> 02:22:00.140]   And it's a virtual machine. You can get a vmware. You can get a virtual box. Um
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:02.780]   Takes no time at all. It took me like 10 minutes
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:05.420]   And you're ready to go and you can help
[02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:07.980]   basically archive the internet
[02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:13.660]   I have a couple of different things I can uh talk about it is the super blood wolf moon
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:16.540]   eclipse
[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:21.660]   Coming coming uh sunday january 20. You know those are all made up right? I know
[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:23.260]   Yeah
[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:25.740]   It's in usa today, dude. This is science
[02:22:25.740 --> 02:22:31.580]   It is a wolf moon because of the time of year, right?
[02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:39.900]   Mm-hmm. Um, it is a blood eclipse because it's uh the moon is passing into the shadow of the earth
[02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:46.780]   Uh, it is super because we are close to the moon. So it's big not that much bigger
[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:50.620]   And uh, did I get all of them super blood
[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:53.500]   wolf moon eclipse
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:57.500]   The super moon I actually looked it up because I was trying to figure out what it was
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:00.780]   And that term was invented by an astrologer
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:05.980]   It's like one degree larger or something. Yeah, very tiny. Yeah
[02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:07.980]   It feels good
[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:09.980]   There will be three super moons this year
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:11.100]   Just in case
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:16.300]   February 19th march 21st as well as january 20th if you like the blood moon idea that I think native
[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:18.780]   Americans have
[02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:22.060]   It's like eight or not eight or nine different moons. Oh
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:30.460]   Native americans called the january full moon the wolf moon because it appeared when wolves howled in hunger outside the villages
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:33.100]   Yeah, there's a blue corn moon and there's uh
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:35.820]   There's a bunch of them
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:39.580]   Okay, not happy about that. How about this every uh year
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:46.140]   Bruce sterling the science fiction writer who I love does his state of the world address at south by this year
[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:53.740]   He's doing it online state of the world or s o t w as it's known 2019 on the well
[02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:56.780]   nice the well
[02:23:56.780 --> 02:23:59.100]   And that's why it's in a
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:01.340]   career
[02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:06.300]   He says he's a great writer the chinese year of the pig 2019 here we are
[02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:11.180]   Uh, we do this state of the world every year out of sheer glee
[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:17.260]   It's a mental hygiene for us a comic relief like taking cleansing squeegee to our grimy apartment windows
[02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:21.580]   Which is something I actually did here just yesterday and I can tell you my views a lot crisper now
[02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:25.100]   the end of 2018
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:33.660]   Well, he says when it's an apotheosis of my live out of a bag 21st century digital nomad lifestyle
[02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:36.300]   He ended up in a beza
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:38.300]   but he noticed
[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:39.260]   that
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:43.180]   He's the same mood was everywhere spread worldwide. He calls it the new dark
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:47.100]   It's gray. It's become it's not a fatal gloom
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:51.500]   But it is a kind of learned helplessness amalès and bill willderman
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:57.660]   It's very much the attitude of people who sign onto facebook because they can't yet figure out any other way to live
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:01.500]   They do that because they must conform to the apparent need
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:07.180]   Despite their vague ox-like awareness that they're being spied on tricked
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:09.980]   and defrauded
[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:15.100]   This is that it resigned melès that fits the post note and internet and tech industries consolidation
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:22.940]   It's the funeral aftermath of moor's law. It resembles a fat sweaty guy on the couch snacking on poisoned cookies
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:25.980]   That's how it is
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:28.860]   State of the world. Yeah, it's a little gloomy this year
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:35.340]   Do you know he lives in turing? Did you know that was all over? He says he's been in a bea bea bea bea bea mosa the year
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:37.100]   turn he
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:40.060]   Yeah, I just know when the ticket around
[02:25:40.060 --> 02:25:44.940]   Yeah, probably he's got money right he's rewrote. I assume yeah
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:48.140]   And get ready
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:52.700]   I want to i'm immediately going to move to the university of pacific in california
[02:25:52.700 --> 02:25:55.820]   Because pepsi is rolling out a fleet of robots to bring
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:58.860]   students snacks the snack bot
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:01.100]   will carry
[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:05.820]   smart food delight popcorn baked lays potato chips pure leaf tea and starbucks
[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:14.940]   Cold brewed drink students will place their order on the ios app and have them delivered to select locations around the 175 acre campus
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:18.380]   How about that?
[02:26:18.380 --> 02:26:24.460]   Do you want to snout soon before they get hacked? Oh, yeah instantly people hate these people are vandalizing the waymose
[02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:31.180]   For crying out loud the Teslas are killing the robots. It's it's crazy. It's war out there. It's crazy
[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:34.060]   That was one begun the robot wars have
[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:36.060]   Are you speaking in yoda?
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:40.860]   Begunned the robot wars have are you speaking in yoda?
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:49.660]   Begunned the robot wars have hey, that's pretty good. Nice. Um, oh and I love this
[02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:58.220]   Uh, atent is putting a 5g star on your phone even though it's just 4g
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:00.860]   Small print not actually that's fraud
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:05.580]   Is just downright fraud. I bet they backed down and now the t-mobiles mocking them
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:13.020]   This atent now has 5g in over 400 markets my atent phone doesn't say that
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:21.580]   5g with little sideways e it's sideways, you know, it's slanted because it's moving fast the e stands for evolution and really it's just
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:24.300]   lt
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:26.380]   Our big
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:28.220]   our big telecomm company rogers
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:31.420]   offers an unlimited account
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:33.980]   Was an asterisk
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:41.900]   And they actually went to court to argue that they can use the term unlimited for an account that is limited
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:48.300]   Because well, it's not it's not unlimited
[02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:52.540]   Yes, it's unlimited in lots of theoretical ways
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:56.940]   You get as many bits as you could ever want. It's just that they get slower
[02:27:57.740 --> 02:27:59.740]   slower and slow
[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:06.060]   Archive team.org i'm going to sign up for that when I get home and i'm going to be home in a minute because we have wrapped up
