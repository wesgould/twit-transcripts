[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.440]   This is Twig.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.040]   This week in Google, Episode 82, recorded February 16, 2011.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.240]   3D phones.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.280]   They come with an aspirin now.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.720]   This episode of This Week in Google

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.360]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840]   This week in Google, the show that covers everything
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.240]   in the cloud, really.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   But the Google is the majority of a lot of the cloud.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.000]   These days, Leo LaPorte out vacationing.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.280]   He is winging his way back from Antarctica.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.080]   Actually, he's not winging.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.920]   He's on a boat.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200]   So he's floating his way back.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   Water winging him.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.640]   He's water winging him.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440]   He's swimming with water wings.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.600]   So it'll take him a while.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.800]   But he will be back for next week's this week in Google.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.600]   Tom Merritt here, glad to be filling in for him.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.760]   Joining us, as always, glad to have Gina Trapani.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.960]   One of the treats of being able to do Twig
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.680]   in Leo's absence was being able to host a show with Gina
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.080]   and Jeff.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.680]   Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.520]   How's it going?
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.400]   Great to be here.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.160]   Missed Leo, but Tom, it doesn't really mean Leo impression.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.600]   I won't hold of you at the same time.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.480]   This is the slow way around.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480]   By mean, you don't mean cruel, right?
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.120]   No, no, no, I mean like skillful.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.040]   Thank you.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.600]   Also with us is Jeff Jarvis Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   Good to have you along, Jeff.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.960]   I know you weren't sure if you were going to make it in time.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.400]   My mind is retired.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.520]   Yeah, you just flew into Canada.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.120]   I'm in Victoria, BC.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.920]   Go Lions.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.880]   I haven't seen a thing.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   Oh, Lions, what are those?
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.720]   That's the CFL team.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.920]   I said, I wouldn't know that.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.120]   Wait, see your face.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.720]   Not a real man.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.960]   I wouldn't--
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.560]   The Canadian Football League.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.040]   Oh, ah, right.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.560]   OK.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.960]   Go get out of the window.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   I think it's fine.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.080]   And also joining us this week, NELI Patel, managing editor
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   at gajit.com.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.120]   Great to be on the show with you again, NELI.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.400]   Hey, Tom, I was going to say I'm chasing you around the Twig
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.640]   cottage, it seems like.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.720]   Yes, I know.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.680]   I go from one show to another, and all of a sudden,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.040]   there's NELI.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.920]   Hey, I'm not leaving.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.840]   I'm not hanging up the Skype columns to the membership.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.280]   In fact, NELI is going to be on Tech News today this Friday,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.120]   and I'm not even going to be on the show.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.160]   Yeah, I'm actually replacing you, and we need to talk.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   How was your Leo invitation now, NELI?
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   Oh, mine?
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280]   Well, not as bombastic or as authoritative.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.920]   So it's very nervous, and I'm not very good at it.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   I'm working on it, though.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.320]   I spent a lot of time in the mirror.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.440]   I do too.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.960]   Just in general.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.120]   All right, we got some good Google News break.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   And today, the Texas Attorney General
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.280]   is spilling some secrets.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.200]   He's asked for-- well, he wants to spill some secrets.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.680]   He's asked for a list that is 13 pages long.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.680]   I guess this list was actually asked for last summer,
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.400]   so we don't know whether Google has complied or not.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.520]   But it includes 39 different requests for documents
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.200]   ranging from those setting forth Google's policies
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   for calculating AdWords prices to what they think
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.040]   of their competitors.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920]   Jeff, have you got a chance to review this?
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.680]   I looked at it briefly, and it's this weird thing
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.520]   we have in America.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.400]   We want you to be big.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.800]   And when you get big, then you're too big suddenly.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.880]   And I don't know what the definition is.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.520]   I don't think Google has done anything in an antitrust manner.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.360]   Microsoft was worse than even Microsoft.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.440]   It was a silly fight against them.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.520]   And so the problem here is that when a WikiLeaks area,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.120]   God knows what can be revealed from this
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.560]   about business secrets that could have an impact, including--
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.520]   and we'll talk later, I think, about spam and quality--
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.280]   how the system operates.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400]   I think Eric Schmidt, when I interviewed him for my book,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.360]   said-- and we can fight about this,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.680]   and it's worthy of discussion--
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.000]   he said that he believes Google is as open as it can be.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.880]   That means that, of course, you're
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.240]   not going to reveal your algorithms.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.680]   Of course, you're not going to reveal the things.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.320]   He says that policy is that when something goes on,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.840]   he tells people to write down what it is we do
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.480]   and make that public and hold us to that.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.080]   And he believes the company is very public.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.800]   What do you think?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.880]   I think the company is trying to be public,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.760]   although there are areas that I don't think
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.160]   are antitrust whether or not.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.040]   Like, for instance, getting help with unstarring
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.760]   that stupid slash dot article from my Google reader that's
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.600]   been stuck there since December 17.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.200]   I can't seem to get anybody to answer that.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.400]   I don't think that's an antitrust problem
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.000]   when you're talking about how they actually
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.920]   process their advertisers and all this sort of thing.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.160]   A lot of the stuff that they're asking here
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.440]   seems to be trade secret type stuff.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.440]   It does.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.040]   So this is a really standard discovery request.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   In a lawsuit, both parties try to get as much information
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.320]   from each other as they can.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.760]   So in terms of what does this look like in a lawsuit,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.040]   this is pretty normal stuff.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.320]   I think the antitrust issue comes up.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.640]   And the reason Google is always tripping over these lines
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.680]   is because nobody knows how they actually
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.760]   use their monopoly to make money.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.480]   And that's actually a really important question.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.000]   They have a huge monopoly on search.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.560]   And they have competitors that--
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.480]   Well, but, dude, hold on.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.760]   Hold on.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.120]   They have 65% penetration in the US.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.720]   They have a near monopoly in Germany
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.440]   where they were more anti-Google words 98%.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.880]   But here in the US, it's more like 63%.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.280]   I wouldn't call it a monopoly on the advertising side.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.480]   But that definition of monopoly--
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.800]   there's no fixed number.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.960]   The government doesn't have a number that's
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.000]   for a court to decide whether or not
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.640]   your specific share of a market affords you
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.160]   monopoly status.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.600]   And that's a fair question for the governments
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.960]   be asking about large companies.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.040]   Have they achieved the monopoly?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.520]   Hold on.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.160]   I'll say again, just that if the monopoly--
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.080]   even if there is a monopoly, the monopoly was not reached
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.400]   illegally, then it's not illegal.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   No, no, no, no, but you've got it backwards.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.120]   I mean, fine.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.720]   Yes, you can reach monopoly illegally.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.200]   That's not the question that's being asked here.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.280]   This is the classic antitrust question.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.600]   Are you using your monopoly in one market
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.680]   to unduly interfere or influence a separate market?
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.280]   Are you tying things together?
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.920]   So the Microsoft case was you have a monopoly in operating
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.680]   systems, and you're using that to unduly influence
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.840]   the browser market.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.120]   And that's an argument.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.680]   I mean, obviously, it got resolved over a long period
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.400]   of time.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.240]   I think what Texas is saying to Google here
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.880]   is you have a monopoly in search,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.440]   or what appears to be a monopoly in search.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.040]   And now it's very clear that you're using that to influence
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.240]   not only your basic text link ads business,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.040]   but you're going after the display ads business
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.520]   in a very serious way.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.040]   And we want to know, A, how are you influencing your search
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040]   results on your page?
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.360]   Is it just algorithmically?
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.840]   Have you had discussions inside Google
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.120]   about manually moving pages around?
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.520]   Can people buy page positions?
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   How do you-- your ad rates?
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.400]   What are your ad rates?
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.600]   How do you generate them?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.920]   These are like-- they're trade-secretary business questions.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.760]   But they're also-- they go right to the heart of the tie,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.080]   which is you have a monopoly in search.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.680]   How is that affecting your business in this other arena?
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   And are these people--
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.640]   But that is two things together.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.000]   Much of that is known.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.800]   Google says you cannot buy a position,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.280]   and you can take them to the word or not.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.200]   You can choose to get them under oath
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.000]   and argue that they have perjured themselves.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.360]   But they've said straight out, you can't buy a position,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.760]   but you don't do that.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.280]   Right.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.840]   The rate setting is seen in public.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.360]   They have now announced-- early last year,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.200]   they announced what their split is on AdSense and AdWords
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   with their customers.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.640]   Most of this is-- no.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.400]   Sure.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   That's fine.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.640]   I don't think anybody's arguing that you
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.800]   have to take the government side or Google side or whatever.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.240]   The government's job, in this specific instance,
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.320]   is to regulate the market and make sure the market's
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.520]   working effectively.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.800]   And the market doesn't work effectively
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.600]   when you have a monopoly player that is using that money.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.000]   I wish to how they do it against AT&T, Varan.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   You can argue that.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.360]   That is the goal in the heart of net neutrality regulation,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   is to say you have this monopoly in access,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.160]   and you can't use it to affect all this other stuff.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.320]   I think we have a government that is trying
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.000]   to be as activist as a can.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.760]   And this is the difference between the SEC
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.200]   and a federal organization.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.680]   This is a state attorney general.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.160]   And whether or not this state attorney general
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.320]   can have any influence outside of the state of Texas
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.320]   remains to be seen.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.280]   But in terms of this discovery request,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.080]   and this narrow thing, we want to know how your company works
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.880]   and what you're doing with your monopoly,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.240]   this is pretty standard business.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.600]   I mean, this is one of those moments where my fiance
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.080]   and I are both attorneys, and we laugh about how people
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.400]   freak out at discovery requests.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.680]   But discovery requests are supposed
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.320]   to be hugely broad.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.000]   But they're so dramatic.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   They're so dramatic.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.080]   We want every machine you own, every Twitter account
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.040]   you've ever touched or seen.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.800]   There's a problem.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's like, can you guys face this?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You ask how everyone can be a business attorney.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I wish I'd say that the judge will give you them in the press.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.080]   And that's the issue that I really have here,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.400]   not to become Google fanboy, but the role I play and do it.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.000]   That's what I do.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Well, sure.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.760]   But it's-- there's a certain--
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.640]   especially with attorney generals and political figures,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.960]   there's a certain amount of grandstanding.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.560]   But in the context of this is discovery,
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.200]   why wouldn't you ask for every single thing you can get?
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.440]   And wait for the other side to say, this is too much.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.280]   Judge, please make them back off.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.960]   I mean, that's just the game.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.760]   The question they're after here is
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.240]   whether Google favors its own businesses and advertisers
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.880]   in results.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.960]   That seems to be-- yeah, there's a few other questions.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.560]   But that seems to be one of the central questions.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:01.960]   Gina, do you--
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   I always bring this up.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.480]   I always bring this up when that comes up.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.360]   Is the I-Sat in meetings with Yahoo,
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.680]   when they were number one?
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.720]   Oh, those were the days, my friend.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.880]   We thought they'd never run.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.920]   When Yahoo would proudly say, we throw our fire hose at things.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.840]   AOL said the same thing.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.800]   The New York Times--
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.280]   They almost told us.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.920]   --votes in one slot.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.480]   I mean, that's part of the advantage of being in business
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.160]   is that as you do that and Google does it less than others.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.640]   It's the advantage of being in business when you run a curated
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.160]   home page, right?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.880]   So right now, I know an AOL's home page links
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.400]   to an Engager article because it shows up in our stats.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.240]   And I can see it.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.400]   And actually, it's funny, AOL, when that counter goes off,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.960]   the home page is pointing at us, it's actually marked in red
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.720]   because that's bad traffic.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.640]   It's not organic and gadget traffic.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.480]   So we know, and we're very aware of when
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.080]   we're pointing curated links at something.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.160]   Google is supposed to be running a neutral business, right?
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   I mean, the whole point of Google is that--
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.520]   They don't have to do that.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.600]   They don't have to.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.560]   You don't have to.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.760]   But that's the best tell the consumers that they're doing.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.680]   It's reinvented that.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.520]   Right.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.080]   That's what they tell consumers they're doing.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.600]   That's what they-- they're not curating their search results,
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:10.760]   right?
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.440]   They're not doing it in a way that--
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.000]   I don't know, say, Mahalo does it or whatever, right?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.840]   They're not running a portal.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.120]   They're running a search site.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   And you're ranking in that search site
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.760]   as dramatic economic impact in business.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.120]   Now, if they want to say, well, we're
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.560]   going to start curating search results.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.120]   And you can pay to be higher or lower.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.320]   Or this is how you game our algorithm.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.040]   That's different.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.600]   And I think that would be perfectly bad.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.200]   But right now, to say, these are neutral search results
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.040]   and Google Health is at the top of the list.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.560]   I think that's problematic.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.040]   That's how in WebMD is lower, because we're competing against them.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.720]   And so we're taking our monopoly in search
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.160]   to promote our other tangentially related business.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.960]   I can't see how that's anything but problematic.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.160]   Jida, do you think that's problematic if Google--
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.160]   I mean, Google says that it's not doing this.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.280]   But even if they did, do you think that would be an issue?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.680]   If they said, well, you know what?
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.800]   We're going to put Google Maps up at the top,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.520]   because we run Google Maps and we believe in it.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.440]   I mean, I think it depends on the situation.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.520]   Generally, I do think that would be a bad thing for them
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.400]   to put them at the top of the search results, not the ads.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.840]   At the same time, when I search for a business,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.400]   I get their place page, which kind of brings together
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.560]   a bunch of the Google Map and reviews from various sites.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.840]   So they are kind of doing that a little bit.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.160]   But they say that they don't favor their own properties
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.360]   in terms of ranking search results right now.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.720]   And this is an interesting question,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.480]   not to skip ahead in our list of stories.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.280]   But given the JCPenney Google story
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.840]   that the New York Times ran recently,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.320]   that JCPenney was showing up really high-end search results
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.480]   and that they were using sort of blackout SEO methods
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.160]   to do that.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.120]   And they had-- the spam team had flagged them
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.920]   for cheating kind of a few times before.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.280]   But at one point, the author mentions
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.680]   that JCPenney is one of Google's biggest advertisers
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.800]   and is it possible that they treated them a little differently
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.480]   or not as harshly or not as quickly because of that.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.800]   I don't think that Google is doing that.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.600]   Well, I think we also have this big problem right now
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.960]   with Google quality of search.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.800]   And I'm not sure-- you know, Matt Cuts,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.680]   on last week's show, said that the search quality is better.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.880]   But there's still a PR issue.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.040]   I just added to the rundown of it before the show,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.320]   if this is new, that Cuts just talked about a new Google Chrome
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.760]   plugin that lets you blacklist-- make your own blacklist of sites.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.120]   Yes.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   Basically a content farm blacklist.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.280]   So you can take demand media sites
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.360]   and cut them out of your personal search.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.800]   And what's interesting about this, too,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.760]   is what Google's going to do in this case
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.400]   is watch what gets blacklisted by individuals
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.520]   and see whether or not that is a good indicator of sites
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.200]   that they should affect differently.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.680]   Clearly, there's no such thing as neutral search.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.600]   We don't want neutral search.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.960]   Neutral search would be-- would treat the spammer the same way
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.840]   it treats the New York Times.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.240]   The search algorithm is going to try to give advantage to quality.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.560]   And there's going to be some way to define quality.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.760]   And the problem in commercial sites
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.760]   is that the SEO guys are galloping ahead
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.200]   and Cuts is running as fast as he can.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.040]   But there's a perception where there's true or not, I have no idea.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.920]   I don't have any facts or figures.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.040]   There's a perception building in discussion online
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.960]   that Google's fallen behind the spammer.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.400]   And the content farms.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, I don't want to-- this is completely anecdotal.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.880]   And I don't want to complain too much because I love Google
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.200]   and I love Google search.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.360]   And I agree with you, Jeff.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.800]   I think there's a perception that Google's falling behind.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.600]   And I think the reality is that Google search is still pretty good.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   But I can tell you that a lot of times I will see content
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.240]   scrapers rank above end gadget in Google search.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.480]   And all they've done is scrape our content.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.400]   And that's maddening.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.920]   And I don't know how to stop it.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.720]   It's like I can call Google and be like, places higher.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.280]   It's what I want to do.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.960]   Well, they have two things too.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.720]   That doesn't help any.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.200]   Exactly.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:07.320]   And so I think there's a need for a D-Day here on this issue.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.520]   Or there's an opportunity for another business for competitor.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.440]   That's what's that other new search engine that's trying
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.240]   to do all Yahoo like with humans, which I don't think
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.840]   is going to scale or work.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.800]   But there's an issue here.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.200]   The spam problem is bad.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.560]   And if you define spam broadly as those kinds of aggregators
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.400]   and as spam blogs and as content farms,
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.720]   then we have a crap problem.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.480]   The other problem there-- this is very much a double edged
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.160]   sword for Google, because there's content farms and demand
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.720]   sites and all that stuff.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   A lot of them make money on Google ads.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.840]   And so Google is the one who's serving them the money
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.480]   by incentivizing them to gain SEO, to game page rank,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.760]   to do all those things.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.680]   I think Google needs to fight this battle on two fronts.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.520]   First, they need to obviously improve their algorithm
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.800]   and figure out how to weed out scraped content,
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.440]   demand content from actual curated premium content.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.960]   And second, they need to stop essentially paying the bad
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.640]   content to be produced.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.960]   That's a really good way.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.360]   That's a philosophical question for them at this point.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.520]   It's also kind of a meter question, right?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.360]   Because I used to consult for about.com.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.240]   And about.com is pretty darn good.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.000]   Only by the New York Times company,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.120]   what demand did was turn their human actions
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.360]   into algorithmic actions to just make a cynical factory out
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.000]   of it.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.960]   And basically follows the same thing.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.920]   It's just worse.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.040]   AOL has seed.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.560]   They're trying to do a better version of what demand is doing.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.200]   So what it becomes is highly qualitative, highly
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.560]   matter of judgment of is this a crappy article about how
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   to fix the toilet?
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.720]   Or is this a good article about how to fix the toilet?
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.800]   And the old page rank way of saying
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.040]   that we, the people, would give the answer to that
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   is kind of falling apart because I don't know why.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.320]   Gina, you told me.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.480]   Well, because you have--
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.080]   I mean, in the JCPenney case, you have blackout SEO places
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.400]   paying people who want to make a little extra money
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.520]   to put these links, dresses linking to JCPenney.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.680]   I mean, these aren't humans making web pages linking
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.200]   to these sites in good faith.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.520]   I mean, there's several different ways
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.760]   to game the algorithm.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.320]   We don't know all of them because we don't really
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.080]   know the algorithm, which is part of the reason why
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.160]   the algorithm needs to be a secret.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.400]   You can't be transparent because it would just
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.000]   make it easier for people to game it.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.680]   But it is a little bit like a snake eating its own tail.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.320]   You want to run the links in your site
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.920]   to make the money from the Google ads,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.200]   but then that misses a page rank.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.480]   And then it's just people linking to crappy articles
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.440]   to raise their rank and make money.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.280]   But then everybody--
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.920]   So what would you do about it?
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.280]   What are the creative solutions?
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.360]   If this idea of crowdsourcing in the bad sites
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.080]   is somewhat interesting, but I don't think it scales very well,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   what's the creative solution for the creative solution
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.640]   company to do?
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.080]   I mean, you need a better algorithm.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.640]   They just have to keep doing what they're doing,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.040]   which is to make the algorithm better.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.840]   I think when you look at these sites that just link
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.440]   to places or getting paid to link to places,
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.920]   these link trading deals, it's very obvious to humans
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.640]   that these sites are basically blank pages
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   with nonsense content, with just links.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.840]   I think that Google needs to figure out ways
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.520]   and maps working on this.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.000]   And the Google team is working on this figure out
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.640]   how to determine how to rank those sites lower
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.360]   and detect that activity.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.880]   And it's an arms race, though.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.440]   I don't think there's one silver bullet solution.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.040]   And there have been a lot of articles posted recently
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.400]   saying that Google is actually better at blocking
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.440]   these things than they used to be or anybody used to be.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.200]   It's just that we've gotten so comfortable with getting
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   good results that when we do get the bad results,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.280]   we get angrier than we used to.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.560]   Right.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.320]   And it is still possible to game them.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.840]   This is not safe for work, folks,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   but the Rick Santorum problem, if you followed that.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.720]   You're talking about the alternate definition?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.600]   Yes, exactly.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.440]   That's been around for a while.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.840]   It's good old Google bombing, and Google bombing still works,
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.000]   which I think is funny, but probably a problem
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.560]   for Google.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.440]   Well, yeah, as long as Google bombing works,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.600]   there's something wrong with the algorithm.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.680]   It shouldn't work, right?
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.000]   It's like a test case.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.960]   And Google bombing and link farms are not the only problems
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.640]   they face, Business Week, Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.520]   Do we call them Bloomberg Business Week every time?
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.280]   I don't know.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.840]   Every time I link apps to them, I end up writing both.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.640]   And I feel very--
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.320]   I still call the Pan Am building in New York, so scroll.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.480]   All right.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.760]   So whatever they're called, have a report
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.320]   that Google has cut in half malicious software,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.800]   affecting users of its search engine,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.440]   driving out the hackers, like cockroaches
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.600]   into the neighboring buildings.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.000]   They're apparently going to Bing and Yahoo and Twitter.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.800]   I love the visual on that.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.520]   Hackers targeted Google 38% of the time,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.320]   as of December 31.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.200]   That, according to a report, to be released later this month
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.320]   by Barracuda Networks.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.560]   Google accounted for 69% of the attacks
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.080]   in a sample conducted around June, so that's a big decline.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.120]   Are they-- I mean, are we going to see the same sort of reaction
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.720]   of, well, yeah, it's gone from 69 to 39,
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.040]   but they're still at 39%.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.520]   It's unsafe to use Google.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.880]   We don't see that reaction.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.600]   It seems to be all the angers against content farms.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.080]   So I'm just catching up here in the story.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.600]   I hadn't actually seen it.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.040]   You know, this is like a crazy problem for Google to have.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.080]   Is it not only do you have bad search results in their search,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.640]   but they have malware in their search.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   And--
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.440]   There's malware on the internet, right?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.920]   There's malware on the internet, and Google's
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.600]   finding it and surfacing it, right?
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.200]   And now these guys are not targeting, being, and whatever.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.360]   All this points to is the fact that every search engine
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.480]   has an algorithm.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.240]   And apparently, every search, they all
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.200]   need to be talking to each other on ways
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.840]   to weed out the crap from their algorithms.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.640]   And it's beyond like a competitive situation,
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.200]   where--
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.360]   That's an anti-trust issue.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.440]   Or is that a necessary good for the whole kind
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.720]   of collaboration that can occur?
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.560]   Is there a search good guys?
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.520]   Well, something so here the antitrust issue
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.400]   would be our Microsoft and Google collaborating
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.920]   in their search results to the detriment of some other market.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.200]   And the market would be the market for malware.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.880]   And I don't think the government is going to prosecute
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.920]   detrimental effects on the market for malware.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.120]   Well, but at some point, does demand media come in and say,
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.440]   listen, I write stories about how to fix toilets.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.480]   You may not like them, but if people like them, it's fine.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.080]   And if you all gang together to try to destroy my now
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:42.000]   public business, I would say go after them.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.800]   But Google, these are a lot of lawyers for that one.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.040]   You and your wife have come up.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.200]   If Google and Microsoft do band together
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.160]   to de-wank and demand media sites or other sort
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.760]   of associated content or whatever, yeah, that's problematic.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.960]   And I think those companies would have a fair case to say,
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.520]   now you're affecting our business,
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.400]   you're colluding to affect our business.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.240]   But if it's like the users are demanding
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.120]   that these search results gets filtered,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.640]   and we're sharing best practices across companies
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.600]   to exclude things like malware, then I don't know
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.320]   that there's enough of a problem.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.600]   I don't know that it's a prosecutable sort of thing.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.640]   - I've lost it.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   The one area where I think Google does have a monopoly
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.760]   is it's decision to decide that you're a bad site
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.400]   and we're not gonna let you advertise and make money here.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.080]   And so there've been cases against them
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.100]   where an aggregation site says we're not a spam
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.480]   iteration site, we're a legitimate directory
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.360]   and you heard our business.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.840]   - How are they monopoly in that case and not another case?
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.400]   Isn't it the same argument of the amount
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.120]   of market share they have?
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.720]   - Well, the problem here is it's unlike the ad rates
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.000]   which are set by a fairly open marketplace.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.120]   In this case, Google does have dictatorial views.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.480]   And I've said that if I were Google,
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   I would come up with a jury of peers,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.400]   of other ad sites and other users
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.600]   who can rule on these things, kind of separate from Google
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   because it's in their interests not to have the crap in here.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.280]   And if they say this is crap, then sorry, guy,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.320]   the jury of your peer says you're crap, you're out.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   - Well, that's how you would like
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.480]   what that Chrome extension is.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.200]   - Sorry, Jeff.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.280]   - Sorry, Jeff.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.800]   I was gonna say that that Chrome extension
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.080]   where you can say don't show me these results again
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.960]   sounds like a step in that direction
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.920]   of Google taking signals from users
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.320]   who curate the results.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.720]   I'll be really interested to know if they use those blocking
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.120]   signals to help them make decisions about what to demo
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.960]   and what not to.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.120]   - All right, whole, how many of you would actually use it
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.440]   and block things?
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.840]   - I've already using it.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.560]   - You are, I was working.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.880]   - All right, I mean, it's fine.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.720]   I mean, you know, it's, I feel bad using it
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.080]   'cause I feel like I have to see everything
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.760]   just based on what I do, but it works.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.920]   I mean, it's taken out some of the crap
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.080]   that I usually see that I don't wanna see.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.200]   - I have it installed and I always forget to use it.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.920]   - I'm actually not gonna use it
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.440]   because I feel like I wanna see all the results
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.280]   just because of what I do.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.840]   I wanna see what sites come up.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.680]   - Yeah.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.600]   But that does it, but not the target.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.440]   - Are you like me?
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.120]   I'm assuming you're like me, you run 15 browsers, right?
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.120]   I run like five browsers a day.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.320]   So I feel like, okay, Chrome is like my safe place.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.160]   - Right.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.000]   - That's my happy place.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   You know, I've got all this other stuff going on.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.640]   (laughing)
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.520]   - When you're at the doctor,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.560]   they ask you imagine you're in Chrome.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.960]   - As they put you under.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.280]   (laughing)
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.840]   All right, we're actually having even got
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.320]   to the biggest news of the day.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.040]   Google CEO Eric Schmidt was presenting in Berlin
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.160]   with a number of publishers,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.440]   a new program called OnePass.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   Publishers will be able to set their own prices
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.840]   in terms for digital content.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.800]   They can maintain direct relationships
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.880]   with their customers.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.560]   Anybody who's heard about Apple's publishing system
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.280]   probably can tell where this is directed at.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.960]   Publishers with existing print subscribers
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.360]   can give those subscribers free access.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.160]   There's a single sign on across all platforms.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.400]   That means whether you're on an Android app
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.440]   or you're on a tablet or you're on your computer,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.520]   you can sign in with one Google login
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.000]   and get access to that news.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.960]   There's also a single sign in across news organizations.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.360]   So if you're a subscriber to say the New York Times
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.840]   and the National Review,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.640]   you can sign into both with the same login
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.840]   as long as your subscription's up to date.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.280]   And Google is only taking 10% versus Apple saying
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.640]   we're taking 30%.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.000]   Now, Apple yesterday said we are going to require you
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.280]   if you sell a digital subscription outside of our app
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.600]   to also offer it inside the app at the same price or less.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.440]   Google says today--
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.760]   - Our Apple takes a 30%.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.800]   - Right, and Apple takes 30%.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   Google today says one pass also offers payments
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.000]   in mobile apps in instances where the mobile OS terms
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.320]   permit transactions to take place outside of the app market.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.880]   Definitely targeted at Apple there.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.120]   So who wants to go first?
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.960]   Gina, as a developer,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.400]   if you're choosing between iOS and Android,
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.120]   does this make a big deal
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.960]   if you're a publisher of content?
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.440]   Of course, I'm going to go with the 10%.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.800]   I mean, 30% is a lot.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.640]   I actually think that the Apple terms are fine.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.680]   And I think it makes sense.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.440]   And I'm sure they're going to create a really great
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.120]   one-click buy experience,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.880]   but 30% is a lot.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.160]   And I'm worried about what's going to happen
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.520]   to Kindle and Pandora and those apps on iOS.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.840]   So if it's confirmed, is it confirmed
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.280]   that Google's only going to take 10%?
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   Or I thought that was a rumor.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.800]   I wasn't sure if that was official.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.640]   - No, that's good point.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.520]   It's a moco news is reporting
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.560]   that they have a source who told them it was 10%.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   Google itself hasn't clarified that.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.400]   - Okay.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.280]   So as a publisher, I'm going to go, obviously,
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.600]   I'm going to go with the company
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.800]   that takes less of a giant cut.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.520]   And also because it sounds like
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.800]   you're going to be able to get this content
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.720]   through the web browser as well.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.640]   I mean, if I go onto my iOS device
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.040]   and just go to the website and it's usable
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.200]   and kind of read my content there
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.640]   without using an app,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.840]   then I might go that way.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.160]   But iOS is a really huge market share
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.000]   and a lot of publishers really love it.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.560]   So I don't know if this is going to affect,
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:27.920]   I don't know if new publishers will choose Google over Apple
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.280]   for that reason.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.000]   - You know, I get the sense in talking to Apple,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.400]   we spoke to them a little bit around the Sony reader stuff.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.040]   I've had some other little conversations
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   that I'm hearing there.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.560]   You know, I get the sense that they're rolling this stuff out
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.400]   and they've already talked to the publishers
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.360]   and they've already talked to Amazon
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.120]   and they've already talked to, you know,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.960]   Wall Street Journal and all of that.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.440]   - Really, they didn't talk to Rhapsody.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.800]   - Yeah, I think they have a pretty contentious relationship
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.640]   with Rhapsody.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.480]   But you know, I think they've talked to their big players
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.840]   on their store and they've said this is coming.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.160]   You know, I just get the sense that
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.920]   Apple knows its market is so huge
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.760]   and its users are so much more likely
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.040]   to spend money in the store than Android users.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.560]   That they really, I mean, this is the classic,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.320]   we'll make it up in volume argument.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.720]   Whereas Google has a lot to prove with Android Market
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   when it comes to users paying for stuff.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.800]   So Google could take a 0% cut.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   If nobody's buying anything,
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.960]   it doesn't matter to the publisher.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.960]   Whereas you have a proven track record
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.120]   and a proven history of iOS users paying for content.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.720]   And I think that's why Apple is very comfortable saying,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.040]   "We're taking 30%.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.600]   "Now, you know, I agree with you, you know,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.880]   "if I'm a publisher, you know,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   "my first instinct is to go to the lower,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.200]   "it's the higher revenue split in my favor."
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.640]   But I think the secondary consideration there is,
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.840]   you know, I want to go out and build the best experience.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.960]   I want to target the devices that are already there.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.560]   And, you know, until the Zoom comes out
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.640]   or this new HTC flyer or any of these other Android tablets
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.320]   we saw in Mobile World Congress,
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.680]   you know, the only game in town for tablet publishing
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.360]   is the iPad.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.360]   And I think that really plays an Apple's favor as well.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.760]   You know, Rupert Murdoch launched The Daily was,
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.480]   he said, "For this year and next year,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.160]   "we believe that the only competitive device
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.760]   "will be the iPad."
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.400]   And that's really saying a lot,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.320]   considering how many devices are coming out this year.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.640]   - It's also Rupert Murdoch saying.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.760]   - Well, I mean, he's saying what you will about him.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.480]   He's proven that a pretty good media business.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.680]   - Oh, go, go, go, go, go, he's thrown in.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.880]   I used to work for whatever's got in to disasters
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   on the internet.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   (laughing)
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.600]   Don't fly, he's in my space, but did I say more?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.800]   He's thrown, he's thrown,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.600]   with zillions of dollars after internet failures
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.520]   and not gotten there.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.600]   So, you know, say which will, yeah,
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.320]   I respect him in terms of a lot of his publishing smarts,
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.560]   but I'm not sure that it's transferred over.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.560]   You know, I think part of the,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.120]   I think this is very related.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.480]   There's a problem here,
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.840]   which is that this is,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.600]   these are, this is the E lotus for publishers.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   Just as the iPad has lured them into thinking,
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   "Oh, good, we have our whole world of control back.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.720]   "Now, one pass is gonna roll them into thinking."
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.440]   Finally, people will pay for our content
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.720]   'cause it's wonderful.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.080]   And it's gonna have them go down the wrong path
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.320]   for longer in my view.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.240]   Again, I'm not against charging for content.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.280]   You can hold my book, I wanna sell the book, it's great.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.920]   But in a world of,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.120]   of absolute abundance, that's a problem.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.800]   I wrote a post this week arguing that the problem
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.840]   David Carr wrote a post in the New York Times,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.280]   or a column, we used to call them columns,
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.960]   complaining about the Huffington Post
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.440]   and how, you know, they're on the slave ship there,
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.600]   working away.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.000]   And he made fallacious assumptions, I think,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.880]   which is that value is in content and content has to be work.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.200]   And if you go to Huffington Post,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.720]   you'll see that a lot of the value in there
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.400]   is in the community, is in people talking,
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.560]   people getting attention and other things.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.880]   And the old formula, I don't necessarily work,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.400]   but publishers never would have started Huffington Post,
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   wouldn't buy Huffington Post
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.160]   'cause they don't understand that.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   And so now comes a payment scheme
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.440]   that I think is gonna make them go down a road that says,
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.040]   "You must pay for our content."
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.240]   And people are gonna say, "You know, demand's not that bad."
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.600]   - Demand media or demand for--
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.720]   - Yeah, demand media, right, right,
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.120]   media, you know, you're gonna charge me
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.640]   for your toilet fixing article.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.240]   And that's when good enough takes on
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.800]   a very big market appeal.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.840]   - Actually, I prefer it when you say crappy toilet
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.680]   fixing article.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.960]   Because of the joke.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.800]   - Touche.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.640]   - I was not intentional, but I'm glad you had it.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.760]   - I'm in a strange position here, right?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.440]   I mean, I work for a company that just bought
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.600]   the Huffington Post.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.080]   So yeah, I think they're great.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.840]   (laughing)
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.680]   They're awesome.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.600]   But I also, you know, I run Engadget every day
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.920]   and we spend a lot of time
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.320]   making sure that we're writing the best content that we can.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.560]   And sometimes we fail
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.360]   and sometimes other people outdo us.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.200]   And, you know, but whatever,
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.600]   I think a lot of the time we come close to succeeding.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.360]   - You get rewarded for that.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.120]   - And we're extremely rewarded for it.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.720]   Our traffic is doubles every year, right?
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.560]   And it's not just 'cause more people have cell phones.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.040]   I think we're actually competing and winning
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.000]   against some of, you know,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.040]   there's a lot of demand tech coverage out there,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.920]   you know, demand style tech coverage out there.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.400]   And I think we're beating those guys in a real way.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.560]   Whether that translates into you should pay
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.240]   for the Engadget app on the iPad or any of that stuff.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.760]   And, Jeff, I'm with you.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.240]   I don't think anybody, I don't think I could charge to pay,
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.120]   you know, for Engadget's core content.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.720]   I've often thought that we could charge
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.160]   for some other premium content.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.120]   Like additional value ads on top of the site.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:40.960]   - And here's the problem.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.800]   That's sort of what's gonna happen.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.280]   - That's gonna happen as well.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.160]   - Well, what's gonna happen is that old style publisher
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   is gonna come along and say, "Aha, now I can charge for,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.000]   you know, the San Jose Mercury News can suddenly just say,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.520]   we're gonna charge for our tech coverage."
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.920]   Well, it hasn't been worth anything for 10 years.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.800]   And they're gonna think that's their salvation.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.120]   And rather than learning how to do content in new ways
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.640]   and add value in new ways and the values of curation
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.120]   and the things that you do, I'm afraid.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:07.960]   And we'll see.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.160]   But I'll just bet you, we're gonna hear a whole chorus
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.760]   of saying, "God bless Google."
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.920]   Now, Google doing this, I think is potentially,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.440]   and I've felt this for a while,
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.360]   there's a soup soul of cynicism here
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.080]   that is, you know, publishers all hate us.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.720]   This is our way to Brown knows them.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.400]   And they felt trapped by Apple.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.560]   We're not gonna make anybody on this.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.400]   So what the heck?
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.600]   10%, 15%, 5%, who cares?
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.000]   There's no money here.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.120]   So this is Google saying,
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.800]   we're gonna make nice with publishers
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.320]   and make them happy with us.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.640]   But I think that there's actually danger here.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.680]   Well, Robinson.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.920]   - And I think Rupert Murdoch does have a point,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.960]   at least for this year,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.560]   that iPad is the dominant platform, right?
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.200]   So if you're a publisher out there
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.160]   and you're looking at this,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   you say, "Well, obviously I wanna go with the 10%."
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.440]   Like you said, Gina.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.160]   But right now, 80% plus of the people
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.640]   who are gonna read my stuff, at least on tablets,
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.520]   which is the preferred form factor
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.720]   for reading this stuff,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.080]   are on iPad.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.320]   So I'm gonna develop the book.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.000]   - There are browsers there.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.160]   There are browsers there
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.800]   that the numbers have been very hard on that,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.640]   that it's browsers.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.360]   And again, look at the numbers for the paid apps,
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.640]   wired from 33,000 down to 28,000,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.800]   glamour 2800 down 20% a month,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.160]   even as the penetration is hockey sticking.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.880]   So this idea that people are paying for content
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.360]   on the iPad, granted the models have just changed.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.440]   But still, it wasn't going with the right direction.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.800]   - Right, but so I think here's my counterpoints of that.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.640]   And I agree with you.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.560]   I mean, I have the daily on my iPad.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.880]   I'm never gonna pay for it.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.320]   I assure you it's not gonna happen,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.280]   unless something dramatically changes.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.760]   But we have an Engadget app on the iPad.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.240]   We have an Engadget app on the phone
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.840]   and on Android and WebOS and all this other stuff.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.080]   I think we even have a BlackBerry one,
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.680]   which is very strange to me.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.080]   - Oh, aren't you generous?
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:02.920]   - You are.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.600]   - It's very aggressive.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.400]   - We have eight people use our BlackBerry app.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.200]   But I think there is some sort of value
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.840]   to the experience, right?
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   - Yeah, I'm not sure what's that.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   - But I think that's really important.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.640]   And I think if you can add additional features
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   to an experience, the New York Times
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.600]   comes to your tablet in some form,
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.040]   and then you can pay a dollar a month
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.520]   for additional New York Times features
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.280]   or additional access to archives or stuff like that,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.120]   you do need a payment system for that.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.720]   You do need some sort of recurring billing model
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.640]   and centralizing it for platform is not a bad idea.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   - I just don't think so.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.120]   - I mean, meanwhile, again, what we're doing
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.480]   in our business is it's all about old wine and new casks.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.920]   Meanwhile, this last week, I don't know
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.760]   if you've followed Andy Carvin, ACAR, VIN on Twitter.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.880]   He's the head of social strategy at NPR.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.880]   He's been doing an unbelievable job.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.600]   I recommend everybody go follow him.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.800]   He curated Twitter for Egypt.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.840]   He's doing the same now for Bahrain and so on.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.680]   And it's great.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.920]   Now, there is, but my point is, that's a new form of news.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.800]   The daily is not a new form of news.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.880]   The daily is, you know,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.760]   - It's a new presentation.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.840]   - Light news. - Model.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.640]   - You know, it's funny about the daily.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.040]   I don't want to harsh too much on it,
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.360]   but it is very much the New York Post on a tablet, right?
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.080]   I mean, that's what Robert Murdoch made.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.360]   And since it launched, I have yet to see one link
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.920]   to a daily story where someone's like,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.960]   you've got to go read this.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.560]   Outside of that Tumblr blog that links to all of them, right?
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.400]   - Exactly.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   - The daily index.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.040]   You know, that's actually their problem.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.880]   Their problem is not philosophy or design
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.280]   or presentation or packaging.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.880]   It's a content problem.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.080]   And you know, I'm with you on all this stuff about new models
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:51.000]   and new ways of distribution and, you know, Twitter,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.600]   I think in itself is just a wildly new way
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.920]   of distributing content.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.120]   But at the end of the day,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   you've got to have something good to read.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.640]   - Oh yeah. - Good to look at.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.080]   And I think that's where all of these publishers are sort of,
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.960]   you know, they've got old media, like literally old media,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.880]   like old print style journalism that doesn't translate
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   to any new sort of online format.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.480]   And that's really the problem.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.560]   - What if we just have publishers developing HTML5 apps
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.880]   and they boom, they can charge whatever they want,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.640]   nobody gets a cut and they're on every tablet?
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.240]   Will users use that?
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.360]   Or is there an app mindset now that's,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.720]   that just even though there really isn't a difference,
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.320]   they have to have the little icon?
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.080]   - You know, there's a huge nexus between HTML5,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.400]   like web apps like Chrome apps and iPad apps.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.760]   I actually ran a really long post about this
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.560]   when Chrome OS was announced in CR48 came out.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.080]   A lot of the Chrome apps are essentially
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.800]   just repackaged iPad apps.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.680]   And the wrapper around the iPad app is just, you know,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.080]   so you can buy it as an app.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.240]   But inside it's a web view to an HTML5 application.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.680]   So I mean, Google, you know, it's Google.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.080]   They do everything.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.880]   They're clearly going down that road as well with Chrome OS.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.920]   - Gina, what do you think?
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.320]   I can, do you think that people will go for web apps?
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.000]   If the industry did go there,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.720]   which is not where it's going right now, but.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.080]   - Yeah, it's a tough question.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.920]   I don't know.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.760]   I mean, the native app experience is a really good one,
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.080]   but you know, that your point was absolutely true
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.080]   that that's basically HTML5 apps basically do look like iPad apps.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.040]   I mean, I would love to see a place,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.440]   I'd like to see Android and iOS
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.000]   and all the mobile operating systems get to a place
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.240]   where they can run HTML5 apps the way that, you know,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.560]   Chrome does on the desktop.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.320]   And once that happens, you know, have that kind of easy install
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   the way you can with the Chrome store
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.480]   or the Chrome Web Store right now,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.320]   just say, "Hey, add this to my home screen."
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.360]   If you could have the kind of benefits
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.560]   that you get with native apps that you could just, you know,
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.800]   I purchased this thing, I installed it, it's on my home screen.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.040]   If that could be a more seamless experience, perhaps.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.160]   But you know, this app model has worked really well.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.440]   It's, you know, turns my phone into a cache register.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.080]   I mean, does anyone else feel like all your computers
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.760]   are just turning into like cache registers?
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.200]   Like, ways to send money to someone?
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.280]   Oh man, I just did my, I just totaled up my taxes
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.520]   to get ready to do, to file.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.880]   And I looked at how much I had spent on apps,
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.560]   so it's a ridiculous amount.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.360]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.200]   It's just so easy.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.240]   I mean, between the Mac App Store and the mobile App Store,
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.080]   it's crazy.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.040]   But, you know, just talking about one last thing
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.400]   about OnePass versus the Apple subscription model.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.560]   I mean, the one thing that Apple did really well,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.440]   and I wish that Google had done,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.040]   was to let consumers opt in to sharing
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.480]   their personal information with publishers.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.720]   You sort of alluded to this, Tom, you intro the story.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.800]   You know, that whole Google saying
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.560]   that publishers will have a direct relationship
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.360]   with their customers means, as you kind of alluded to,
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.600]   that personal information will get shared with publishers.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.000]   If I never receive another piece of spam
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.840]   in my physical mailbox, because I subscribe to some magazine,
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.280]   I'll be happy.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.000]   So I really liked that Apple did that.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.280]   I wish that Google had done that.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.160]   It felt like a move toward, like Jeff said,
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.760]   Brown knows in the publishers versus trying to do the right thing
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.360]   by the consumer on that one.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.160]   I do support, I mean, I understand that the newspapers
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.760]   are used to having a certain amount of information.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   They want to continue to have that.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.240]   But I do appreciate Apple drawing a line there.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   That's not right.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.400]   You know what, you can't have this much.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.880]   I mean, there's too many companies go the other way.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.080]   Right, but that's because they've abused it.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.880]   You know, you go back to...
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.920]   Huffy and Post once more.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   I don't need any...
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.480]   Guilty content.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.280]   Yeah, I don't mean to, you know,
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.960]   now it's like Huffy and Post.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.920]   But Howard Kurtz talked about just the same story
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.280]   that existed on Huff Po or on The New York Times.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.480]   And Huff Po is so much more of a social experience.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.240]   They recognize the value of the relationship.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   And publishers don't.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.320]   And the value of the relationship isn't to spam you.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.840]   The value of the relationship is to give you relevance
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.800]   and to use signals to give you more value,
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.920]   which certainly is what Google and Facebook understand
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.640]   that publishers don't.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.440]   They think once they have your name,
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.600]   it's a chance to sell you to spam you.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.520]   All right, well, we haven't even touched
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.800]   on mobile world Congress yet.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.960]   We have a ton of Android news to get to.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.160]   Before we do, I want to thank one of our sponsors,
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.400]   FreshBooks, the easy online invoicing service.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.680]   If you're doing any kind of freelancing,
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.960]   any kind of contracting,
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.400]   if you run a small business and you've been dealing
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.600]   with having to use a word template to make invoices
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.960]   and print them out and send them out
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.800]   and then keep track, who paid me what,
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.640]   how much, when this is something you want to try out?
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   FreshBooks.com, go try it out for free,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.520]   quickly and easily create and send professional looking invoices
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.440]   right from within the service on the web.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.560]   Talking about web apps, here's one for you, web service.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.720]   Your clients can then download a PDF of the invoice.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.440]   You'll receive payments for your invoices,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.720]   your clients can pay you either by PayPal
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.440]   or 11 other electronic payment services.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.680]   They can just use their credit card to give you your money.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.160]   You can also opt for additional options
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.480]   like late payment reminders, invoice by the hour,
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.920]   time tracking, all kinds of good options.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.120]   In fact, they even offer, for those clients are like,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.600]   I don't like, I don't want to use the computer,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.280]   they will print an invoice and mail it
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.600]   with your return address on it to a client
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.360]   for $1.39 per invoice.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.440]   Try it out for free today.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.280]   They have three different levels,
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.440]   but the free one allows you to use three clients.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.240]   So if you only have three clients, that's all you need.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.960]   It takes about a minute to set up an account.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.880]   Go to freshbooks.com, you sign up,
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.200]   and when they ask you how you heard about FreshBooks,
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.840]   'cause you get it free whether you're a twig listener or not,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.480]   but when you ask how they heard about FreshBooks,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.840]   do enter the code twig, T-W-I-G,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.440]   and you will be signed up to receive possibly
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.560]   a free birthday cake.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.640]   They draw a name every day for the entire month
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.040]   and it doesn't even have to be your birthday.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.440]   They turn it into your birthday, actually,
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.120]   by sending you the cake.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.960]   You might get two birthdays this way.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.800]   - I'll take the cake, but I don't want the birthday.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.520]   - You take the cake, Jeff.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.840]   - You already do take the cake.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.600]   - Take the cake, leave the birthday.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   You don't get older, you just get another birthday.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.440]   - That's it, okay.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.800]   - All right, try it out, freshbooks.com.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.760]   - That's better, say that.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.840]   - Enter the call for code twig,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.640]   and we thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.600]   All right, so mobile world congress,
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.240]   let's start with Eric Schmidt getting up on stage.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.200]   This was an opportunity for me to remind people
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.360]   he's actually still the CEO.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.320]   When does he step down?
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.640]   - When he's stepping down, I saw him.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.320]   - When does he change his status?
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.520]   - I think it's the middle of the world.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.280]   I saw him in Davos, he went through his list
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.840]   of responsibilities and basically being the public face
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.200]   because Google remains the one it is.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.400]   - So we're gonna still see him doing his stuff.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.040]   - He's leaving, he will no longer be the CEO
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.880]   as of April 4th.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880]   - April 4th, okay.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.600]   - And I think we're gonna see a lot more of Larry Page
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   when that happens.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.200]   - Yeah, we're gonna have different kinds of appearances.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.040]   - Right.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.560]   - Meanwhile, Google did have a keynote
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.720]   at Mobile World Congress, and I'm curious
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.480]   what you all think of these things.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.320]   Google showed off a movie studio for tablet,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.800]   video editing app.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.960]   They, Eric Schmidt mentioned that they were trying
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   to get Nokia to use Android and they're still open
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.760]   to the idea.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   And the rest of it was stuff that I'd heard before.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.520]   Gina, did you have anything new here?
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.200]   - We were joking that Eric Schmidt has the science
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.760]   of delivering an extremely boring keynote
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.280]   like perfectly investor.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.360]   - He's the un-job.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.760]   - He knows exactly what to do to make us sleepy.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.520]   You know, it was a lot of stuff we heard
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.760]   about Android, a lot of lofty stuff about Android.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.280]   You know, these two bits that you're talking about
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.200]   and Gingerbread and Honeycomb being combined
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.000]   and the Nokia stuff, that actually came during the Q&A.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.840]   It didn't happen.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.680]   - That's right.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.520]   No, that's a good point.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.360]   - You know, it got tough.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.200]   So we had to, so many of you have to be prompted
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.840]   for this interesting stuff.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.480]   You know, it's funny, and in the movie studio
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.920]   is very interesting.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.000]   It's a video editor for Honeycomb.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.080]   They demoed it on the Zoom.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.680]   It can do video editing stuff.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.480]   You can cut clips, there's a timeline.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.920]   You can add a soundtrack.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.320]   - Well, what's funny about that is it was long ago leaked.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.680]   We realized that TechCrunch actually posted it
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.080]   in their hands-on of the Zoom like months ago.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.560]   And everybody, everyone just assumed it was part of the OS
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.520]   and nobody gave it a second thought.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.560]   So really fundamentally in the keynote itself
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.160]   there's nothing new.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.000]   I think the Nokia thing is very interesting.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.680]   It seems like Google really tried to get Nokia on board
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.560]   with Android and simply just could not offer them.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.440]   I think two things.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.840]   One is assurance that, you know,
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.920]   Nokia has this huge IP portfolio.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.000]   And I don't think they want to use it defensively.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.040]   You know, they're just doing Apple, they're doing all this stuff.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.400]   I don't think Google could offer them IP assurances
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.240]   around Android.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.720]   I think that was actually a big deal for Nokia.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.080]   And second, I think Microsoft was like,
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.120]   well, basically cut the license rate
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.000]   to Windows 7 to zero if you give us access to services.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.320]   And Nokia saw that as a huge differentiating factor.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   - Aren't they paying Nokia to take it almost?
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.360]   - I've heard the money.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.800]   - No, no, no, no, no, that was a rumor
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.240]   that spread for some reason.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   - Okay.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.560]   - Chris from our site sat down with Stephen Elop
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.600]   and straight up asked him,
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.520]   which direction is the cash flowing?
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.400]   And Stephen said, you know,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.640]   we're not gonna disclose that exactly,
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.400]   but we will tell you that on balance it is neutral.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.840]   So it feels like, you know,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.280]   it's essentially, you know, on paper
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.440]   they might be paying a royalty,
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.760]   but Microsoft is paying them back
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.160]   for use of OV and stuff like that.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.000]   And I think Google just couldn't offer them that stuff.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.960]   They couldn't say, well, we'll pay you to use OV
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.120]   when we run Google Maps.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.280]   And so I think, you know,
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.560]   Google made a real big pitch in Nokia and ultimately failed.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.360]   But you know, he sends a certain amount of arrogance
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   around Google and Android right now
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.680]   where Eric Schmidt was like,
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.080]   well, the door's still open.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.800]   And Vic Condotro is saying, you know,
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.880]   two turkeys do not make an eagle.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.960]   You get the sense that they think
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.200]   Nokia and Microsoft are gonna fail
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.840]   in a very serious way and know he will come back to Android.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.640]   - What do you think?
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.480]   - I don't know.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:13.120]   I'm still, I'm dealing with like Nokia fanboys
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.280]   writing a new gazette every day
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.000]   saying that we ain't Nokia thick.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.040]   Now, I mean, there's a lot of blame the message.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.520]   - You are fault, Patel.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   - Just trying to get through the day
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.600]   without getting shot.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.760]   But no, you know, I do think it's--
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.600]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.120]   There are Nokia fanboys.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.680]   - Oh yeah. - Oh my God.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   - You don't say something mean about Nokia right now, Jeff.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.080]   You'll be interested. - I just did.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.320]   - Yeah, no, I mean, on the scale of fanboys.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.160]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:39.680]   It's like the circle of fanboy hate for me.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.520]   Everybody accuses me of hating their thing
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.720]   and loving the next thing.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.880]   So, Android fanboys always accuse me
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.280]   of being an iOS fanboy.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.120]   Nokia fanboys accuse me of being an Android fanboy.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.600]   And Windows fanboys accuse me of being an iOS fanboy.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.640]   So, it's like a good circle that I exist in the middle of.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.560]   But, you know, I do think that,
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.800]   you know, Nokia choosing Windows 7
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.840]   has put a lot of momentum behind that platform
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.080]   and a lot of renewed attention on that platform.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.680]   And that's nothing but a good thing.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.360]   And honestly, you know, this two worst race
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.880]   between iOS and Android isn't good for consumers.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.600]   You know, we're waiting on two companies
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.640]   to do interesting things.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.720]   And, you know, HP is making a huge bet on WebOS.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.080]   They're putting a lot of money.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   And that's where I was last week, right?
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.520]   It's a multi-million dollar event for WebOS.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.960]   I think it's good for everybody
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.480]   that there are all these huge companies
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.840]   doing what they do best or trying to do
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.720]   what they do best to push the market forward.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.720]   And so whether or not Nokia and Microsoft succeed,
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.400]   that obviously remains to be seen.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.760]   Two huge companies do not have a track record
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.280]   in this space over the recent period.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.200]   But is it good?
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.040]   I think it's great.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.120]   I think it's better to know if you're becoming
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.520]   yet another Android manufacturer.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.320]   - Well, in every popular announced phone
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.120]   at Mobile World Congress this weekend,
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.200]   all the press events started on Sunday,
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.560]   finished up yesterday.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.640]   Every one of them was Android.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.040]   - Yep.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.840]   It's dominated the show without question,
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.280]   except for the Snowgate announcement,
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.760]   which has been on the tip of every song.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.320]   So, you know, and really crazy announcements too, right?
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.120]   Like the PlayStation phone officially announced
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.200]   and PlayStation gaming is happening in Android.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.520]   Can you imagine that from Sony?
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.600]   Like that is mind-blowing for Sony to be doing something
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.720]   like that.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.760]   You can see that Google's changed the market in that way.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.480]   But I don't think it's good for every manufacturer
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.760]   and every, from Microsoft,
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.080]   like screw it, we're doing a Windows phone
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.760]   like Android for now on.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.800]   I don't think that's good,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.200]   because then you really only have one open system, right?
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.640]   And if the only open system is Android,
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.040]   there's no competition between hardware makers,
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.080]   there's no competition between, you know,
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.680]   some middleware vendors and stuff like that,
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.040]   that you need to have a universally good consumer experience.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.680]   There's just Apple and it's one device
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.520]   and Android and everything else.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.000]   - Didn't this devalue the value, you know,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.800]   you make money otherwise, we have a number somewhere
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.880]   in the realm we'll make from each Android user.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.080]   The operating system itself is now worthless.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.600]   - $9.85 per year in 2012 is the estimate.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.360]   - Which ain't bad.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.680]   - And it'll only make it better.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.360]   And so what's interesting to me is how an operating system
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.320]   becomes value less.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.360]   It becomes a door to other value.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.120]   - By its platform.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.040]   - Yep, go ahead, Jim.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.120]   - Which is the, you look back at the Microsoft days
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.720]   and you see how much that world has changed.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.760]   I just find that, I think we're at an interesting point.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:37.640]   - Gina, do you think, what do you make of this statement
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.560]   that Android is going to combine gingerbread and honeycomb
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.320]   and start arriving on a six month cycle?
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.800]   I think a lot of people thought they were going to go
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.480]   to tracks and he basically said, no,
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.600]   we're going to keep it on one release
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.320]   that will be useful on both platforms.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.200]   - I'm pretty happy about that.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.640]   That was definitely the announcement
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.280]   that was most interesting to me.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.720]   - I'm happy to hear that there's going to be
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.480]   a six month cycle, that's good,
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.840]   because it seems like the Android releases happen
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.400]   fast and furious and it's so hard to keep track
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.040]   of what phones run what.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.280]   I actually thought that honeycomb was going to run
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.720]   on both phones and tablets,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.520]   but so there is going to be that sort of temporary divergence.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.000]   We're not really sure for how long it sounds
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.280]   like it'll be a year, right?
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.520]   So like if honeycomb and gingerbread come out,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.160]   what do you do the 30 out?
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.920]   - I would like to see a clearer timetable.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.440]   I would just like, I would like more clarity about this,
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.880]   but it's nice to hear that they're going to merge
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.400]   and together an ice cream sandwich
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.000]   or whatever it's going to be ice cream sandwich.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.320]   - Yeah, this goes right to Jeff's point, right?
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.000]   That the operating system to Google is worthless.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.920]   What's worthwhile to Google is people looking at ads.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.760]   And that's I think why you have such chaos
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.080]   in their timeline, that you have gingerbread,
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.800]   which is out, but no one phone that runs it
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.880]   and phones upcoming that may run it, but are skinned,
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.600]   you have phones coming out right now with 2.1 in them,
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.440]   not even 2.2, you have the Galaxy S phones and states
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.080]   that have yet to be updated to 2.2, they're huge sellers,
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.400]   but they don't have even the second to last version
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.000]   of Android on them.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.880]   And now if you're going to have these tablets,
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.480]   and the most interesting tablet at MWC was the Flyer,
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.560]   the HTC Flyer that has the Intrigge touchscreen
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.640]   that supports pen input, and that's running 2.2.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   So you're all over the place if you're Google,
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.120]   and it actually behooves you to try to combine everything
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.920]   and make everything work together.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.480]   But their big problem is that the manufacturers
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.400]   aren't running stock Android.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.360]   Google isn't out there updating HTC Sense to work
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.640]   on Honeycomb or whatever HTC wants to do.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.600]   They're not out there updating touchwiz
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.240]   or MotoBlur, all this stuff.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.000]   So there's this huge delay between what Google does
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and what Google wants and what the manufacturers actually do,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.800]   and it appears that Google is completely comfortable with that,
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.920]   because to them it's just page views,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.840]   it's mobile advertising views.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.080]   And then you look at Microsoft or Apple or HP with WebOS,
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.800]   and if you ask them that operating system
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.320]   is extremely valuable, it's the key to their product,
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.840]   and they want everybody to be on the same page
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.400]   when it comes to updates and apps and all this stuff.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.680]   So that's why I'm saying I think this Windows Pen 7 News
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.480]   is really good for the market,
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.240]   because it provides that sort of operating system consistency
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   and sense of value and cohesion to a broader market,
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.560]   so that Samsung and HTC and whatever else,
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.280]   so Nokia obviously, they're all running an operating system
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:28.280]   that the vendor feels has inherent non-commoditized value.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.600]   Maybe that's the wrong way, maybe Google's still gonna win,
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.040]   but I'd like to see that fight take place in a real way
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.000]   as opposed to Apple's as the iPhone
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.200]   and everybody else has Android friends.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.440]   - Well, the other-- - I think you're right.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.360]   - If it's not just ads, it's also,
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.240]   my view is where this goes, is a couple things.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.680]   First and foremost is signals.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.960]   That Facebook and Google are an award
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.080]   to be the better generator of signals about us,
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.080]   so that they get more relevance in targeting.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.520]   The other thing that I argue is that in mobile,
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.880]   that really becomes local and scaling local sales
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.200]   is the big effort.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   And there you have Google versus Facebook versus Groupon
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.800]   versus Patch and AOL, salute your flag.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.160]   You know, these are still open wars
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.120]   that become very interesting.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.520]   - Well, you know, I'm launching the local tech news site
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.720]   in Patch tomorrow, so--
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.160]   - Are you really? - No, absolutely not.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.920]   - I wouldn't put it back. - That would be, no.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.440]   - Are you launching the geeky,
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.040]   how have you been posting your app?
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.360]   - Yeah, how have you been posting tech?
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.080]   That's actually, we're taking a gadget down
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.160]   and we're just gonna roll that in.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.000]   It's gonna go.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.320]   (laughing)
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.400]   - Oh, the wonders. - Sorry,
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.240]   do I sound a little too jaded?
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.080]   I should probably stop.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.560]   - Oh, internal politics.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.200]   What, before we get Neelive fired,
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.680]   what was your favorite Android phone
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.760]   that you saw coming out of Mobile World Congress?
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.280]   Jeff, start with you.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.160]   - I haven't seen enough of them,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.880]   so I don't know, I'm glad that we're seeing more tablets.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.240]   I think that the, you know, I'm a fan of my Galaxy Tab.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.920]   I don't really wanna 10 inch,
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.120]   but I hope that I'm glad that Samsung stay in
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   and the Tab business,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.600]   and I'm just interested to see more Tab choices coming out.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.640]   - You're not excited about 3D?
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.980]   - No.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.920]   (laughing)
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.760]   - I actually have to admit,
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:21.280]   I'm a little excited about Glass's List 3D on the LG phone.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.480]   I think it's mostly a gimmick,
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.320]   but I'm actually curious to pick that thing up
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.720]   and play with it and see if it wows me in some way.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.040]   - I feel a headache coming on.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.760]   - But it's lenticular.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.120]   - Yeah, I mean, it comes with acceptors.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.320]   - It is a great word.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.720]   - It's a really nice word.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   - It's a ridiculous word.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.760]   - Have you used the Nintendo 3DS yet?
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.640]   - Yeah. - I think gave me the demo day,
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.680]   that thing gave me a headache.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.520]   - Did you really say,
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.520]   "Now, that's why I'm positive about the LG
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.120]   "is 'cause the 3DS actually didn't bother me."
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.240]   I didn't think it was a very crisp 3D,
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.880]   or at least not as crisp as I wanted it to be,
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.360]   but it didn't give me a headache.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.600]   - I think that part of it with the 3DS
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.640]   is that I used like 50 different demo units
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.360]   in 20 minutes to play a game.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.080]   And they were all calibrated differently,
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.920]   so you know how it's like actually getting one of my hands,
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.800]   but seriously, after 20 minutes in that demo room,
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.040]   I was like, "I walked out, I was like,
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.680]   "I need to lie down, this is terrible."
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.520]   - What about you, Nili?
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.920]   - What was the favorite of the phones that you saw?
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.440]   Which ones knocked you out?
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.920]   You mentioned that the flyer
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.560]   was probably the one you liked the best.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.800]   - As far as tablets, I think the flyer's most interesting
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.040]   'cause it's the first really serious attempt
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.560]   to do stylists that we've seen in a long time.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.080]   So very curious to see how that works.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.400]   As far as phones, I think Sony Ericsson
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.680]   made a big splash this year at WWC,
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.760]   particularly because of the PlayStation stuff.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.120]   I'm a little biased because we broke that story
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.960]   a long time ago, and we actually,
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.240]   we had a leaked prototype on the Engashit Show
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.360]   like last month.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.200]   So--
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.080]   - Yeah, I mean, you guys broke, smashed, ruined,
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:52.920]   and finished the phone,
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.240]   so when Sony actually announced it,
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.600]   everybody's like, "Yeah, I know, we've seen it."
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.680]   We've seen it all over the internet.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.520]   - That's what we do.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.200]   We're here to steal your thunder.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.520]   But you know, it's like really exciting
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.320]   to think that Sony has finally made this product,
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.200]   and its users have been begging for for so long.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.480]   And it's not some janky, like we made our own PlayStation OS,
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.640]   you know, you're locked into this environment phone.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.560]   It's an Android phone,
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.040]   and a pretty good Android phone at that.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.960]   You know, it's gonna be running Gingerbreads,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.360]   gonna have all this PlayStation Suite,
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.960]   they're extending PlayStation Suite
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.200]   to other Android phones.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.160]   I think, I mean, in terms of products that are,
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.480]   you know, have the capacity to be revolutionary,
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.440]   this is one of them.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.120]   Now, I've held it in my hands, I've used it,
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.400]   I can tell you it's a little bit chunky,
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.720]   and I don't know how the gaming is actually gonna work.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.600]   And I don't know if people are gonna slide this thing up
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.880]   and say, "Why isn't there a keyboard here?"
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.840]   But I think there is a huge segment on the market,
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.480]   it's gonna be like, "Well, I loved playing PS1 games,
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.200]   "and now I can do that on this phone that has controls."
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.080]   And that's gonna, you know,
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.640]   I don't think you can discount that market.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.560]   So, I gotta say, in terms of phones,
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.080]   it's definitely the PlayStation family,
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.760]   or the Xperia Play, I guess it's real name.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.720]   - Gina, what about you?
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.120]   Is one of these stick out as something to caught your eye?
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.000]   - I'll be really honest, I'm a terrible gadget reviewer,
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.320]   and all of these sort of look,
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.360]   they all sort of run together,
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.920]   and I haven't been able to play with any of them yet.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.480]   I'm still using my Nexus One,
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.920]   and like hoping that the OTA Gingerbread update
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.240]   is gonna come sometime this week,
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.960]   which there's a rumor that it is gonna be this week.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.240]   And I'm also kind of more on a market for tablets,
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.440]   so I'm excited about the flyer,
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.040]   though not excited that it's not running Honeycomb.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.200]   So, what's up with that?
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.040]   - Right, it's 2.2.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.040]   - You know, it's really crazy about this end of the sea,
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.320]   speaking of the Nexus One, Who Away,
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.280]   which is a Chinese company,
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.800]   put out a phone that will be $200 off contract,
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.520]   so it's $200 that has the exact specs of the Nexus One.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.120]   And so that mean, just over the course of what a year,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.600]   Nexus One has last CS,
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.560]   over the course of a year,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.000]   price pressure, supply of pressure,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.480]   has brought the highest end specs down
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.200]   to $200 off contract, which is just wild.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.440]   And I think that goes only so I get it.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.200]   - Well, we had the report, you know,
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.320]   what about three weeks?
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:04.360]   phones with no commitment at $75,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.040]   which is you get to the point of world changing,
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.720]   you get to the point of the next million people
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.680]   coming on with smartphones and the internet,
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.320]   and that gets really exciting.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.360]   - We also just got word today from Motorola CEO,
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   Sanjay Jaa, that the Motorola Zoom will be $799,
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:27.080]   unsubsidized for the 3G version and $600 for the Wi-Fi,
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.360]   so the rumors are true, still too expensive,
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.760]   as far as I can tell.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.680]   The $600 is actually about right, it's 32 gigabytes,
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.360]   so it's the same price as a 32 gigabyte iPad,
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.400]   and it's a year newer,
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.080]   but it's about $70 more for your 3G version.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.840]   And I think people sort of expect these things
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.720]   to be starting to get cheaper now.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.160]   - Yeah. - Yes.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.280]   Yes, it should be getting cheaper.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.640]   Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna do this.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.720]   - It's too rich for your blood.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.360]   - That was really sad, no, it's too--
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   - You know, first generation, I've heard that it just,
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.280]   you know, it feels kind of light and doesn't feel,
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.440]   it just doesn't feel as good as the iPad.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.840]   I'm definitely gonna check it out, but I don't know.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.240]   - You just can wear it as your tablet
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.080]   for your retirement party the way you're going.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.560]   (laughs)
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.880]   - I know, I gotta make a move eventually.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.160]   - Well, the big question for Google is,
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.080]   are there gonna be apps for this thing?
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.000]   In the iPad launch, it had a fairly limited selection of apps,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.280]   so those were the first modern tablet apps,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.640]   and people went crazy for them, and they bought them,
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.120]   and it's only grown, accelerated.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.560]   Google's gotta prove that, you know,
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.640]   the first way that the Android tablet apps
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.800]   can compete with what is now, I would say,
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.160]   the second or third generation of iPad apps,
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.960]   I don't know, I haven't seen anything.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.600]   And I think that's actually a big problem.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.960]   For 600 bucks, you know, you're getting, you know,
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.080]   this new OS, you can do multitasking,
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.240]   and widgets, and all this stuff,
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.360]   but you need to have apps to multitask,
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.440]   you need to have functionality to the device
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.000]   that's beyond the built-in functionality,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.360]   and those questions have not been answered at all.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.960]   But in terms of sheer price, 600 bucks,
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.680]   yeah, and I'll buy that, but, I mean, I buy everything,
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.760]   so I guess I'm not a good case.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.640]   - You're an A-typical user.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.840]   - I'm addicted to my seven inch size now.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.520]   I do not want a 10 inch tablet.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.920]   The ability to thumb type and carry around my pocket.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.000]   - So it's the portability that you like?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.440]   - I really do, I really love it.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.920]   And, you know, so I look at the Zoom, I saw it, Davos,
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.200]   and, yeah, so I get the video wall on Honeycomb.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.720]   You know, I haven't seen anything yet
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.840]   that screams at me that I have to have Honeycomb.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.320]   In terms of the apps, things work pretty well.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.120]   My New York Times app on this is very good.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.720]   The Guardian on web is very good.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.520]   You know, I don't know that I miss it a lot.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.160]   I'm not a gamer.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.560]   - So you're basically just running the browser
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.000]   on your Samsung and your Galaxy tab?
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.120]   - No, no, no, look, there's a New York Times app for it.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.440]   It's very, very good.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.080]   - So how many apps do you have on a thing?
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.560]   - Oh, I don't know, not many,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.000]   but I don't have on my phone either.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.800]   I've, you know, I listen to Gina, I listen to Leo.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.000]   I download all kinds of apps.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.800]   Then I don't use, so.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.640]   (laughing)
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.480]   - Aw.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.320]   - It's one of her apps.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.640]   I love you guys, but, you know.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.960]   - Fair enough.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.120]   Hey, just install what you use.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.920]   - Gina, how many apps would you say you have on your phone
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.340]   and what's the proportion used weekly?
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.840]   - I pretty aggressively uninstall apps
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.000]   that I don't use.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.080]   So I probably have, I would say I use,
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.760]   I have eight apps that I use on a very regular basis.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.600]   - What are you guys?
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.240]   How many do you regularly use?
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.440]   - I have 155 apps on my phone.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.360]   (laughing)
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.520]   Which is probably ridiculous.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.360]   - Show off.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.840]   - I don't know, I mean, in terms of how many I use,
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.720]   I would say I use all the apps in the first two screens,
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.400]   like very regularly.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.320]   So I guess that's what, 32, there's 16 on the screen.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.160]   Right.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.560]   32 apps I use regularly,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.240]   and then everything else is in folders I call up as I need.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.160]   On my Android phones, I don't know,
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.080]   they all have different numbers of apps on them,
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.040]   but they're all pretty high.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   And then I might, you know, on the tablet, on my iPad,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.560]   there's whatever number of iPhone apps
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.920]   and then all kinds of other crazy apps they use on there.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.200]   A lot of games.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.520]   I just think, you know, the Galaxy tab, I love it.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.760]   I love the size, I'm totally with you.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.040]   That 7M size is great for a tablet.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.920]   You know, it's very much easier to travel with it,
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.720]   but Google hasn't shown them
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.200]   that they're building Android tablet apps.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.880]   You know, Samsung is less with the Galaxy tab
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.000]   at that size in a void.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.800]   And now, you know, there's a different screen resolution.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.120]   There's a different OS.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.520]   Samsung has sort of promised
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.920]   that they're gonna bring Honeycomb to the Galaxy tab.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.040]   Don't know if it's really gonna happen
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.120]   given their track record bringing other iOS updates
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.040]   to their phones.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.920]   This is a story that Google needs to make better.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.600]   And this is, I think the inherent weakness with Android is,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.040]   there aren't apps that people wanna buy.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.320]   They're apps that are ad supported.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.920]   And now there's this tablet
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.760]   and we just don't know what the app's doing for tablets.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.280]   - Well, this goes back to the paywall thing too.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.800]   And even lab, even journalism lab,
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.480]   which is an excellent blog covering my wonky part of the world.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.160]   I just saw a tweet from somebody I know arguing that
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   the one pass is really aimed at great measure with the web.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.880]   And so I think Google is putting more emphasis
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.000]   on the web than apps that could be by accident
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.840]   or laziness or lack of strategy
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.920]   or it could be on purpose.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.760]   I don't know.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.640]   - Yeah, I think it's Google being one thing
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.560]   that they're very smart about,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.000]   which is not working themselves into a corner
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.920]   and saying, you know what, we want this to be available
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.080]   in as many places as possible
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.160]   because we don't know where it will succeed the best.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.360]   And it may be on the web.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.080]   Whereas Apple decides we've decided
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.600]   this is the best user experience
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.200]   and we're going to limit things to fit into it
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.600]   because we know in our infinite wisdom
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.920]   that's the way it's gonna work.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.480]   It's the two different ways of going about things
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.320]   the way I see them.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.760]   - I've got 92 apps.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.640]   So I'm behind Neelai.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.880]   I'm gonna have to-- - Aren't you embarrassed?
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.720]   - Yeah.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.000]   It's a little embarrassing.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.520]   And I know, I'd probably say I use about eight or nine,
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.360]   not counting the browser and the iPod, you know, those,
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.680]   but like of the ones you download,
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.120]   I'd say I probably use about eight or nine.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.960]   - I like to use this haiku method.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.160]   - The haiku method?
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.120]   - The haiku method being like cut out everything extra,
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.840]   like uninstall anything you don't need or to use.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.840]   - You have to send.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.640]   - You mean she uses five apps one week,
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.440]   then seven apps the next, and then five.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.680]   - And then five apps the third.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.400]   - Can I throw out a plug for an app our readers developed?
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.720]   - Sure.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.040]   - We're on both iOS and Android.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.960]   We have Engadget podcast Bingo apps.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.120]   So our readers play Bingo during the podcast.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.960]   - That's brilliant.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.800]   - We need that.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.960]   - We need to steal that ID.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.800]   - It's a whole late Bingo app.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.720]   (laughing)
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.880]   - Yeah, it'd be great.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.840]   But yeah, so best apps on the other platform,
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.440]   I have to say, these two reader developed apps.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.120]   It was super funny because A.O.L.E.G.L. got wind of it
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.800]   and tried to shut them down at first.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.680]   And I had to have like the most insane phone call ever
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.000]   being like, I need you to pull back the cease and desist
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.400]   that you sent about the Bingo app.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.840]   Can you please retract the Bingo cease and desist
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.480]   and give them a trademark license so they can use apps?
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.320]   - Nice.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.760]   - It was one of the more surreal phone calls
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.200]   that I've read with this corporation.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   - But great, the app for that,
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.520]   they got licenses, everything's fine.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.360]   - That's cool.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.200]   At least they got the license.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200]   - That's very cool.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.360]   - All right, again, we did hear from Steve Balmer
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.800]   at Mobile World Congress, but they just talked about
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.200]   forthcoming updates to Windows Phone 7
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.960]   and their deal with Nokia, that we didn't really hear
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.440]   about any new Windows phones.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.480]   But we did hear about Facebook phones,
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.080]   but they're running Android.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.920]   These are the HTC Salsa and the HTC Cha Cha,
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.800]   and then of course at the end of last week,
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.120]   and also at Mobile World Congress,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.840]   we heard about INQ's CloudQ,
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.960]   and what was it, I can't see the name of the other one,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.680]   but the CloudQ has the QWERTY keyboard,
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.640]   the other one doesn't.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.080]   And these are all phones that have Facebook integrated in.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.560]   Now the INQ has Facebook right off the top.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.800]   It is the interface.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.080]   There's four buttons for Facebook across the top.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.440]   Your news feed is the first thing you see when you go in.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.760]   The salsa and the Cha Cha have a Facebook button.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.480]   So when you're, and it's also integrated
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.440]   throughout the sense UI, but as you're using the phones,
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.320]   the Facebook button will start to flash
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.120]   when there's something that you could share.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.880]   - It's very nice to let you know.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.360]   - So the INQ phones, these are the second generation
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.000]   of the INQ phones, and everyone seems to have missed
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   the first generation.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.400]   - They had a generation that were Facebook integrated
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.600]   before this.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.320]   - Yes. - Oh, no, yeah.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.800]   - I missed that too. - This is what INQ does.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.800]   So, you know, Facebook's making this mobile push.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.920]   The INQ stuff is like, that's what they've done,
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.440]   and I think they're gonna continue to do that.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.920]   Those are like feature phones,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.720]   and I think that's great for Facebook.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.640]   I think they can't be dependent on people paying $30
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.080]   a month for data.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.920]   They need to somehow get around that
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.880]   and doing feature phones and have Facebook functions
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.960]   is a great way for them to do that.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.800]   - The two HTC phones are just the craziest things
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.640]   I've ever seen.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.000]   I mean, if you wanna guarantee that your phone
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.280]   won't get Android updates, I think having an HTC
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.040]   Facebook into the system and put a button on it
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.240]   that lights up and you're doing something
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.120]   that's Facebook compatible is maybe the single best way
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.560]   to guarantee that you will be locked on Android 2.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.800]   Whatever for the rest of your life.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.040]   - Android 2.3 for the salsa and the cha-cha.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.920]   - That'll do it too. - That's the end of the road
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.440]   for you, no Honeyco, no 2.4.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.760]   I mean, I can almost guarantee that people
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.920]   will be waiting and updates for those phones forever.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.840]   Whether that's good or bad remains to be seen.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.160]   Maybe all they wanna do is press the Facebook button,
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.240]   but why don't you just run the Facebook app on those phones?
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.400]   I don't understand what the push is for Facebook
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.000]   to put a button and everything.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.120]   - It reminds me of those buttons used to get,
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.800]   Jason Howell has actually mentioned in this.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.360]   Those buttons used to get on your keyboard
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.680]   when you'd buy an HP or a compact back in the 90s.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.720]   And it had a little mail.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.600]   So if you wanna email, you press the email button.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.440]   - Right.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.160]   Well better yet, that was gonna be real estate that was sold.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.520]   I have a couple applications.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.680]   I have a museum of dead media technology in my office.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.000]   And next to the cue cats, I have this pad.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.680]   It's about the size of a Galaxy tab.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.720]   And it has buttons on it because type it in this URL
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.800]   is gonna be just way too hard for people.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.320]   And so this is gonna be really valuable to be hooked
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.120]   on your computer and you just hit the Wall Street Journal button.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.360]   And that was gonna be really gonna sell key cap space.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.240]   (laughing)
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.080]   - Right.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.920]   - That is ridiculous.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.520]   - And you'd be on, you wouldn't be able to reprogram them
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.360]   yourself, right?
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.640]   - No, no, no, no. - They'd be too user friendly.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.480]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.720]   This Facebook button thing is really gimmicky.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.000]   I do think there is something to be said
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   for integrating Facebook into a phone,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   but Neelai brings up a good point, Gina.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   Does that obviate us from getting on the Android upgrade
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.920]   trainers their way these two who don't talk to each other
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.480]   and are in constant battle can cooperate?
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.400]   - Yeah, I think the point is great that you probably
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.640]   will be locked into that version that's probably
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.160]   fastest way to stay locked in.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think that Android's current,
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.600]   I mean, I guess I have to see these Facebook phones,
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.800]   Facebook integrated phones, but if you install Facebook
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.840]   and Android right now, the integration is pretty good.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.000]   I mean, it's not front and center, but you merge your contacts.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.280]   I can see my friends on Facebook.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.040]   I can say, take all my Facebook friends' phone numbers
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.480]   and put them into my contacts.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.840]   Now, there's some, there's some where integration.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.120]   I never want to phone with a Facebook button on it,
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.800]   but maybe my 15 year old nephew might, you know, I don't know,
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.200]   but it does seem gimmicky though.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.280]   Definitely I would say that making the app and doing
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.000]   the software integration seems a lot smarter than adding.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.520]   - Also, it's called the HTC Chacha.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.200]   I mean, you like, no.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.040]   - And the salsa.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:08.960]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.760]   - Now, AT&T is going to bring these kinds of phones
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.720]   to the US, but it's not clear that there'll be the salsa
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.360]   in the Chacha, so we may get even better names.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.680]   - Oh, no, it'll be the T-Mobile Chacha 4G with Facebook.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.360]   - No, it'll be the AT&T, so it'll be the AT&T.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.200]   - Oh, very AT&T.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.600]   - Totally unintelligible name.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400]   - I'm reminded of the old Bobby Slaton joke
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.920]   that you cannot possibly order a patty melt
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.480]   and still sound masculine.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.440]   (laughing)
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.880]   - Hey, hand me my Chacha.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.240]   - Salsa.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.960]   - But as well as all this, where's my salsa?
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.800]   - Salsa.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.640]   - Or the Chacha or the Jibotle phone, actually,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.560]   with the Chacha, it would work.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.120]   - Yeah, there you go, exactly.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   - Yeah, it'll be the HTC Chacha Protelet 4G on AT&T.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.760]   - And there was also,
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.480]   Jamalto is making a SIM card that has Facebook
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.520]   built into the SIM.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.080]   They're making a big deal about this.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.880]   And as far as I can tell, it's just
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.840]   integrating SMS features for feature phones.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.240]   This is not a Facebook app.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.040]   - We looked at this, we didn't cover this.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.200]   We looked at it, this is just,
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.560]   I mean, you can put dumb phone apps on SIM cards
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.840]   and you've been able to form a verb.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.200]   And this is just a tiny little bit of Facebook.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.520]   I mean, they already have this.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.360]   - Yeah.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.200]   - They're just using it.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.040]   - They're just marketing it.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.800]   - I mean, Facebook wants to be ubiquitous
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.120]   and they want everybody to be constantly dumping
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.440]   in information on what they are
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.320]   and what they're doing in the face.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.160]   - Dumb thing is the one.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.240]   And they're just, they're going to try to do everything they can.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.880]   I know that Zuckerberg says you're not going to do a phone.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.320]   Eventually the incentive to actually do a phone
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.360]   and market a phone directly to the users
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.920]   is going to be too great for them.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.280]   I mean, they can't stick around,
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.760]   waiting for HTC to put out the cha-cha
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.400]   and have that be their mobile strategy forever.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.160]   I think it's going to be apps and all the platforms
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.000]   and major platforms
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.880]   and then they're going to do their own dumb phone.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   And it makes a lot of sense for them to partner
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.840]   with Verizon and do kind of what the kin was supposed to do.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.120]   Where you have this dumb phone in space
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.800]   we can integrate it in the data plane is, you know,
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.360]   $8 a month.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.440]   That makes perfect sense for them.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.080]   And I would not be surprised to see them
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.720]   try to do something like that.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.400]   - All right, one more story before we get to tools
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.520]   and tips and numbers and such.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.720]   MPEG-LA is starting a patent group.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.040]   This is nice for WebM for VP8.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.200]   So although Google has said that's patent and encumbered,
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.880]   if anyone does have a patent,
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.200]   they can go to MPEG-LA and join up
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.040]   and then they'll be able to license
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.760]   all these patents to Google in one go.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.840]   - Not to Google.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.160]   - Well, it wouldn't be to Google.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.320]   It'd be to people who do use it.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.200]   - It'd be to anybody who wants to use them.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.800]   But then you would think that maybe Google
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.520]   would want to buy this up
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.040]   so that they can continue to give it out patent
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:51.880]   and encumbered.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.640]   Was that even possible?
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.360]   - No, you know, patents never make use themselves.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.120]   So you'd have to, they're not willing to sell that.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.720]   - Google can't pay the license fees for everyone?
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   - Well, they could.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.400]   It would be round about, right?
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.680]   So like, I don't know who would be using the,
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.520]   so Mozilla would want to use VP8
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.240]   and Google would pay for them.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.480]   But Google couldn't pay
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.640]   and then we transfer that license.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.480]   - I'm thinking about like when you go over the toll bridge
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.400]   and you pay for the toll for the guy behind you.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.640]   - Yeah, we'll just pay Mozilla's license.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.480]   - Yeah, here you go.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.000]   But they would actually do the transfer
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.360]   on behalf of Mozilla.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.160]   Google couldn't just buy the license
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.480]   and say, okay, VP8's free again.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.320]   - Right, right.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.280]   - Do you think that--
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.520]   - I've actually been writing this really long.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.440]   - Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.960]   do you think that MPaGLA is doing this
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.760]   because they know people who are ready to join?
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.360]   - You know, I've been writing this really long post on this.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.440]   It's taken me way too long to do it.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.880]   And that's my fault.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   But, so, you know, I think there's two things here.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.120]   I think this is both good for VP8 and bad.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.760]   You know, it's bad because it's supposed to be patent
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.280]   on encumbered.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.800]   You know, Google wants it to be free,
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.120]   Mozilla's fully behind it
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.520]   'cause it's not to pay any fees, all this stuff.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.320]   And then, certainly, you know, it's bad
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.280]   that all of a sudden the MPaGLA is making a patent pool.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.360]   On the flip side of that, you know, video encoding is hard.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.480]   I think I've said this maybe on the show in the past.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.360]   You know, video encoding is really hard.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.120]   And the idea that you can create a codec
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.360]   that is not impacted by any video encoding patent ever
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.880]   is virtually nil.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.360]   So there's a lot of uncertainty about the liability
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.320]   that VP8 creates when you use it.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.920]   And that uncertainty is gonna prevent people from using it.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.840]   It's gonna prevent wide adoption.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.720]   That's why H264 has been widely adopted
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.840]   because it's certain.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.440]   You say, I'm gonna pay the money
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.320]   and now I'm protected from patent liability
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.160]   because I have licenses to all the essential patents.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.800]   So, you know, this is what MPaGLA does, right?
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.680]   They provide you with protection, you know,
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.200]   it's a protection racket, right, from patent liability.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.160]   They pool the patents.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.920]   They say you could buy a license and now you're good to go.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.120]   And so on that, the flip side of it is
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.080]   if they do put together a comprehensive patent pool
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.040]   and they say, well, this is what it takes to use VP8.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.320]   I think you'll see broader adoption.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.040]   People, you know, companies will be able to say,
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.000]   I pay X amount of dollars, I can support this codec
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.440]   and I'm not worried about it.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.360]   And then last and until Google says,
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.160]   we will indemnify every user of VP8 against patent liability.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.200]   This is the only way to protect yourself.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.680]   And I don't see Google rushing
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.560]   and protect everybody from patent liability.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.200]   So it's a really, you know, there's two sides, it's coined.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.960]   You know, it's bad for freedom,
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.960]   but it's good in market reality,
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.400]   which is you want people to use this codec.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.680]   And we'll see, you know, we'll see how that balance
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.800]   shakes out over time.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.840]   - And meanwhile, MPEG, not MPEGLA,
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.080]   but MPEG, the people who made MPEG,
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.880]   are talking about making their own patent unencumbered format.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.560]   - Yeah, they're gonna do a format that,
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.480]   you know, because they have all the patents.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.320]   - Yeah.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.840]   - So they, so you think they could pull,
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.200]   they might be able to pull this off
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.840]   because they're more aware of what they own
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.960]   and own a much broader set than Google does.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.920]   - Right. And so they can get their partners together.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.680]   And it's a long list of partners.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.920]   You know, there's hundreds of companies.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.760]   It's not Apple and Microsoft.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.880]   It's hundreds of companies.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.720]   It's spanning entire range that have patents in this pool.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.560]   They can get their members together and say,
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.000]   this is what we need.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.840]   And, you know, I guarantee you at the end of the day,
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.760]   that codec will be of lower quality than H.264,
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.760]   but it'll be the free codec.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.280]   And then VPA will have a much bigger,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.600]   I mean, then the competition for VPA
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.800]   will be much greater because the certainty
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.200]   around patent liability for this other codec
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.040]   will be there and VPA won't have it.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.500]   And you'll have to pay for VPA when you could just pay
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.480]   MPEGLA and be certain about patent liability
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.320]   and instruction.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.000]   It's, you know, it's a very,
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   it's a really aggressive move for them to do this,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.520]   but I think it makes sense for them in a lot of ways.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.360]   - Jeff, Gina, do you guys have any stories
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.680]   you want to talk about before we move into tools and tips?
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.760]   - I just want to mention one thing,
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.400]   the aforementioned Andy Carvin just said on Twitter
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.320]   a little bit ago while we were talking, interestingly,
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:01.960]   that the report is that URL shorteners
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.720]   are now being blocked in the ramp.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.680]   (laughing)
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.960]   - So I guess my I.ran URL shortener is not a good idea.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.800]   - Not anymore.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.720]   - And shout Bitly when Libya goes up in flames.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.560]   - Right now.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.720]   - I guess because you, is it because you can't see?
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.080]   What's on the other side of it?
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.320]   - I think that's what it is, yeah.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.520]   Yeah, so they're suggesting people should use
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.120]   very obscure URL shorteners.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.800]   Gina, anything before we go to tips?
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.760]   - Quick story that, you know, Google launched
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.160]   the Google Public Data Explorer, actually,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.000]   they, they, they, which is a tool
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.600]   that lets you explore different data sets,
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.600]   but they actually defined a standard for defining data sets
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.400]   and you can upload your own data and look at it.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.760]   So I'm actually looking at the official Google blog
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.080]   right now, it was posted earlier today.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.440]   You can, you know, kind of visualize
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.880]   and explore different data sets like unemployment stats
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.720]   and labor productivity and gender balancing government,
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.320]   but now you can also upload your own data.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.920]   So this is a pretty, pretty neat tool
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.000]   and carve out some time to click around
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.680]   some really cool graphs,
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.320]   'cause some really nifty data is going on here.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.560]   - Yeah, just the stuff that they have in here
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.120]   is really fascinating.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.440]   Things like, like you're talking about
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.720]   unemployment figures, population statistics.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.480]   Do you, can you think of a good example of what someone could do
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.400]   to make good use of this with their own data?
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.160]   - Yeah, I mean, I think if you're working
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.200]   on any kind of project that has, you know,
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   that generates interesting data,
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.200]   I mean, I think that it's worth uploading to this tool
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.240]   just because you can publish and share and visualize it.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.880]   I mean, it really depends on kind of what you're,
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.720]   what you're working on.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.920]   I've definitely been thinking about ways
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.880]   that we could maybe use this in ThinkUp,
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.200]   which is the project that I work on,
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.480]   which is less kind of numbers and numbers based
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.240]   and more kind of, there's more natural language,
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.400]   natural language processing going on in the ThinkUp stuff
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.600]   because it's, you know, it's text.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.720]   But definitely something to brainstorm
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.000]   if you work with data or if anything you work on
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.600]   produces data, check this out.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.880]   Easy way to visualize it.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   - Excellent, yeah, I could have used this recently.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.720]   I poll Twitter and Facebook actually at the same time
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.560]   for ideas and data about what people think is popular
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.840]   for the show I do called Top 5.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.120]   And then I always have to paste it into a spreadsheet.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.440]   (laughs)
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.560]   And I'd like to get some more views on this
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.600]   so I could see maybe using this as well.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.080]   Niele, we always finish up with tips and tools
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.400]   and Jeff always has a number.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.520]   We did, I don't know if we prepped you to have a tip.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.520]   If you have one, you can share it.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.240]   If not, we'll carry on.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.080]   - I don't have a tip repair, right?
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.760]   You know, a plug-in and gadget post.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.040]   We broke the Sony S1 PlayStation tablet this morning.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.360]   It's gonna be an Android tablet with full PlayStation
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.960]   compatibility in this kind of crazy design
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.200]   where they've shifted the weight
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.520]   into the left side of the tablet.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.080]   So you can hold it like essentially like a folded over
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.800]   magazine feels in your hand.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.920]   I think that's gonna be really cool.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.000]   So you should go check like that.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.720]   - Yeah, I saw the, it looks like a patent drawing
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.720]   sort of illustration that you've got on that post
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.000]   and it's really odd looking.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.200]   - Yeah, we heard from a sort, you know,
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.800]   that's sort of like, that's a mock up basically.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.840]   It's not a patent.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.400]   But yeah, we heard from a source that it's gonna be,
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.080]   you hold it in your hand, you know,
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.960]   it's gonna feel comfortable in your hand to hold
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.520]   unlike an iPad, which is kind of uncomfortable.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.120]   And it's gonna be a gaming centric
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.720]   Android PlayStation tablet.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.520]   - But there would only be one way to hold it.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.680]   - Yeah, I mean, that's, well, you know,
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.120]   the other thing is when you've got that hinge on the side,
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.520]   you can turn it to landscape, put it down
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.800]   and type on an angle, which I think is a cool feature as well.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.880]   - Interesting.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.120]   All right, let's get to the tips then, Gina.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.880]   What do you got for us this week?
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.200]   - Google is rolling out two-step verification
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.960]   for Google accounts right now.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.080]   I'm actually, I don't have it in my account yet,
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.160]   but when you get it in your account,
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.240]   maybe you do have it already, set it up.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.360]   Two-step verification basically says,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.560]   "Is a way to tell Google this device
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.080]   is a device I authorized to access my Google account."
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.280]   When you enable it in your account,
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.320]   I believe you've just got a account management setting.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.480]   You'll see two-step verification link.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.960]   When you log into your Google account from a new device,
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.480]   a new phone or a new computer,
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.960]   it'll ask you to enter, in addition to your password,
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.680]   a second code, which you can have sent to your phone
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.240]   or you can have them call you and read it to you.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.480]   And this, in the two-step verification basically
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.440]   secures your account.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.320]   So you know that no one is logging into your account
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.600]   from devices that you don't know,
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.760]   no one's getting into your account without your knowledge.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.540]   So there's totally just security thing.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.600]   Once you have a two-step verification turn on,
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.480]   I think everyone should turn on,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.480]   I think it should be on by default to be truthful.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.520]   - They have really gone to town.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.840]   We talked about it with Steve Gibson on security now,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.960]   this morning as well,
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.360]   with all, thinking through all the scenarios that could happen
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.080]   and making sure that you have lots of different ways
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.560]   to access the account, lots of secure ways
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.680]   to have a backup in case you don't have your second factor.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.520]   - I was worried about that, I'm good.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.840]   - So it's really well done.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.080]   - It is well done.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.840]   - I haven't got it in mind yet either.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.360]   I just checked again, I was hoping to see it,
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:59.040]   but well done on that, Gmail.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.280]   All right, Jeff, what's our number this week?
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.120]   - No big deal, 'cause I was just flying into Victoria here,
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.360]   so I had to scrape for one, but out of the air,
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.880]   Schmidt, you know, we'll milk that cow.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.920]   120 million people using Chrome browser right now,
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.280]   up three X in a year, which I think is pretty impressive.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.880]   - Yeah, that is, well, I'm one of them.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.720]   - I am too.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.600]   - I mean, I'm actually like you, Nili,
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.080]   and I use like six different browsers at once.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.480]   You know, I've got Opera and Safari
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.040]   and Firefox going right now along with Chrome,
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.160]   but I live in one more often.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.000]   And recently Chrome has become the one
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.600]   that is sort of my home base, which is good.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.720]   Actually, I'm enjoying it.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.640]   It actually brings me to my tool,
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.360]   my last tool before Leo returns.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.560]   I learned about this on security now this morning.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.840]   A guy named Jerry wrote in about it called Ghostery,
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.520]   G-H-O-S-T-E-R-Y.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.160]   If you go to ghostery.com, you can learn all about it.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.880]   It's a Google Chrome extension that protects your privacy
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.880]   by, it comes with a list of tracking objects
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.440]   that you can block right from the get-go
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.520]   so that you're not tracked by any of those.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.200]   And then it will also look for things on pages
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.080]   when you're surfing around and say,
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.240]   "Hey, we found this element that looks like
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.120]   "it might be tracking you.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.280]   "Do you want us to block it?"
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.120]   So it will scan pages and make suggestions.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.040]   When it sees something, a little bubble comes up.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.240]   It's got a cute little ghost icon up there
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.960]   in the right corner.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.520]   So if you're not wanting to wait for all these,
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.280]   do not track systems that Google and Firefox
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.760]   and everybody are putting together
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.040]   and want to take matters into your own hands,
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.680]   I think this looks like a good extension.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.200]   I just installed it this morning.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.320]   It's easy install, easy configure, very simple.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.080]   So check it out, ghostery.com.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.480]   - Looks like it flags Google Analytics
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.880]   and Facebook Connect.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.880]   - Yeah, basically it doesn't flag them all as evil.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.040]   It's part of a company that a friend of mine runs.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.880]   - Oh, really?
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.640]   - Now that is trying to come up with new ways
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.400]   to do compliance on the kinds of ad and privacy things
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.680]   that will be coming out.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.920]   And this is one feature so that you can see
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.080]   what's tracking you for good and bad.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.320]   The caution I have about do not track,
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.800]   I'm speaking at a Canadian security and privacy conference
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.720]   tomorrow and I'm going to warn them to know good
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.480]   of unintended consequences.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.520]   We already have do not track.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.720]   We have the means to turn off cookies
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.400]   and erase them into all kinds of things.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:33.320]   If tracking is severely hampered across the web,
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.200]   it's going to severely affect the economics of the web
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.640]   and talk about the whole Huffington Post discussion.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.400]   It's going to have severely effect
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.000]   what can be paid for content.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.640]   So, beware the unintended consequences, my friend.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.920]   When you reduce your value to good sites
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.400]   like the New York Times,
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.360]   you reduce what they can make
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.080]   and how they can pay for this.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.240]   - I think that's a really good point.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.480]   And that's one of the reasons I like this
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.560]   I'm going to add on is it lets me see
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.720]   and takes control over it rather than some blanket.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.000]   I'm going to stop everything from happening.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.760]   And it does do on exit.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.280]   It will, you can have the option to have it exit cookies,
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.000]   even silver light and flash cookies as well.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.280]   So, good stuff.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.320]   - And a good caveat there, Jeff, absolutely.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.520]   Not all tracking is bad.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.080]   You just need to be able to know
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.000]   who's tracking you and why and get to choose.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.520]   - More transparency is good.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.360]   - Yep.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.120]   - Tracking is not necessarily bad.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.760]   Same with content.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.680]   - Farm.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.760]   - This was good content today.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.600]   This was a good content farm.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.040]   (laughing)
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.440]   - Moo.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.040]   - More of my fingernails dirty.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.320]   - That was awesome.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.240]   - Thanks everybody.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.080]   For being on the show,
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.280]   Leo Report will be back on this week in Google next week.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.200]   Jeff Jarvis, anything else to add
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.040]   before we get out of here?
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.840]   - I'm trying to find a Chipotle in Canada.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.880]   I'm told they exist.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.720]   - Wow.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.040]   Okay, the great Canadian Chipotle Hut continues
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.840]   for Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.600]   Gina Trapani, I can't let you get out of here
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.320]   without telling you once again how much I love ThinkUp.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.440]   I am looking at my graphs right now.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.080]   By the week, by the month,
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:04.880]   follow our accounts.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.920]   I love the most retweeted,
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   the chatter boxes and deadbeats
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.120]   sort of follower categorizations.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.320]   Great stuff over there.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.480]   - Awesome, thank you.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.760]   Thank you so much for using it.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.840]   Thinkupapp.com, that's my little plug.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.640]   - All right, and Neelite Patel.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.880]   Always great to have you share your wisdom.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.600]   I can't wait to see your post
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.480]   that you're writing up on MPEG-LA.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.320]   - Oh yeah, to be good.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.240]   It'll be on HuffingtonPostTech.com.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.080]   (laughing)
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:29.920]   Later this week.
