[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   It's time for this week at Google. Stacey Higginbotham is back. Yay!
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.720]   Jeff Jarvis is here. So is Ant Pruitt. We're going to talk about the meltdown and the Google
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.600]   Stort, a little bit about the Google Pixel 6 and why we're all buying one. The silly event
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.280]   Samsung had this morning. Well, it's a nice feature. And the dead end street that's driving Waymo
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   Crazy. It's all coming up next on Twig. This is Twig. This is Twig. This week in Google,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.840]   Episode 634, recorded Wednesday, October 20, 2021. Russian Touchdown.

[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   the show we cover the Google versus the Facebook versus Twitter versus all the other versus.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.040]   And we say hello to our panel. We welcome back Stacey Higginbotham,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.280]   who I'm sorry to say that all the words were used up by Corey Doctorow last week. Stacey,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.680]   so you're just going to have to sit there. There's nothing more to say.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.360]   It's fine. Stacey, you're right. Corey Doctorow replaced me last week.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   Yeah. If you haven't heard of it, it takes Corey to replace you.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   If you haven't heard of the show, Corey is brilliant and hilarious.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.000]   And hilarious. I was thinking about some of his metaphors and things and I was thinking that was
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.880]   funny. That was really funny. Also with us, Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen, I bring out the
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.080]   good book so that I can sing his praises, the Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic innovation at
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.320]   the Craig, no more. Graduate School of Journalism. We need to get a choir in here at the City
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.240]   University that would be fond of New York, maybe, maybe for our thousandth episode.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:08.480]   Wait, is the Utah Boys Choir on Cameo? Oh, is it? Oh, my God.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.680]   Like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I don't care any choir.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.280]   I think they're on there. Oh, let's go to Cameo right now. Before I do that, let's say hello to
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:23.200]   Aunt Pruitt, host of Hands on Photography. Now I'm going to be... Wait a minute, we do need to check
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.440]   this out. No, we can easily put that on a tricast. Let's see. Here's the chairman.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.400]   Sorry if I startled you with my way. I searched for choir and I got Chirica May, Tricia Fukuhara,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.960]   Big E at WWE Superstar, Amy Phillips, television personality.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   It's unavailable. Brandon Evans, an actress in P Valley. I'm not sure I want to know what that
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   show is. Pepper. Oh, that's a great show. Chrissy Teigen's culinary mom, Tyler Oakley.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   I don't think people can't sing. I don't see choirs. Benny B's a hip hop artist. We could do the
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   hip hop version. That would be no. Search on Mormon, maybe. He really, really, Jeff.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.160]   Just Abernacle. Yes, let's search the tabernacle.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:20.400]   There's only two tabernacles and neither one pops up. Really? He's a preacher and hip hop.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:32.400]   Wow. I think Camio's got a search problem. Mormon, tabernacle, or maybe everybody's busy since
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.360]   the pandemic slowed down. It is the holiday season, so they're probably rehearsed. This is what I get.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.160]   Ricky Moore. This is very strange. Very strange.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.320]   Those are just all the people available. You know what I do when a search doesn't work on a
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.600]   site. I just do Google. Let's search for Camio. Choir. Wouldn't it be funny if...
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.760]   Or you know where we could do is we... Here we go. Oh, these are gospel. I wonder if
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.480]   Randy Travis. Randy Travis? Wow. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.720]   Oh, my gosh. I wonder if Travis does sing something to my dad and I dance to him.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.840]   Here we go. Here we go. From our own very own producer, Jason Howell. He says, "Go to Fiver."
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.680]   Let me click this link here. Fiver. Have a choir. I will have a choir. Sing your name, jingle or
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:38.160]   message. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. For 15 bucks. Make it so. Oh, yes. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:46.000]   Golly, gosh, Irino. Commercial use. I guess this is commercial use, but it's only 35 bucks to add an
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.680]   orchestra. Only $15. No, no, no. Let's not overdo it. Okay. Let...
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, I will do this for... I won't be here next week, but I will do this
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.400]   for our next... For your return. Yes, for my return, I will have a specially commissioned.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:12.880]   Meanwhile, we could put a challenge out on TikTok. Oh, yeah, we could get that guy who sings and
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.560]   drinks. Greg Greg Greg. So, show a hand. Okay. First of all, yesterday, Google announced the
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.760]   Pixel 6 and I'm seeing Jeff Jarvis and Chad as Jason and I are doing the show,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:36.240]   crumping. You were trying to order one and then... I... For the minute I could, I put together
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.840]   the cart. I had it in the cart during the entire presentation, your entire presentation.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.800]   I'm just refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, refreshing, the entire
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.680]   hour. I got to get this because I'm in line here. I've been in the very first minute and then finally,
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.920]   it's, "No, we took it out of your cart." "F you," said Google. Me. A number of people got the
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.480]   response. We were sold out, which was apparently spacious, spurious, and fallacious.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.600]   Well, it is because they don't have them. They're out of stock. They're sold out now. I ordered...
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.000]   Got one. I got one. It's coming... Did you order the pro? Tuesday. No. Well, so, yes, I ordered the
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.160]   pro, but I didn't get the... I only get the sunny yellow and under 28 gigs, which is fine.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.440]   That's actually... I got the black and 128. And you were able to get it. I wanted the black and 256.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   Of course, I've never satisfied the O. You're not going to need all that storage.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.720]   Oh, thank you. What did you get, Jason? I got the normal... The Pixel normal.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.760]   You got the amateur, huh, Stacey? Oh, you're... The reason why is because I had a choice between
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.520]   giant and gargantuan. Oh, but it's not about the screen. It's about the camera.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.320]   Amros. It's all about the camera. I don't care. I can't wrap my hand around it.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.400]   I can't... I can't own it. I hate how big it is. You need bigger hands. Maybe if you used a
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   catcher's bed. I'll work on that. Let me stretch out my fingers.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.640]   And which one did you get, Ant? The Twit card got the 6 Pro in white.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.280]   The most important thing from my point of view is that you have the cameras,
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.000]   because you're... That's what I wanted to play with that and see how it competes with this iPhone.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   How big did you get at the OIS? I went with the 6 Pro.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.360]   How big? How much memory? 128, I'm sure. Oh, 128. I don't... I'm not one to do the
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:41.040]   large S. I've got the 64, 3A XL. It's fine. I had to run it out of memory from 64, you might.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:50.240]   This is the 4 XL. This 64. And it's totally fine. I don't keep that much on the phone, I guess.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.600]   If I don't need it, I get rid of it. Stacey, you weren't worried about the camera that you
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.400]   didn't... Aren't gonna get as good a... You're not gonna get that third lens, the 50 megapixel lens.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.480]   Yeah, I don't care. I mean, like, I actually... I'm like everybody else in the world.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.640]   I actually delete my photos. I don't take that many photos. You don't even storage then.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.720]   Yeah. I'm just... I'm a bad mom, really.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   No, you're not. Because if presumably you have Google Photos and so it's all getting uploaded to the
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:28.000]   cloud... Once it's uploaded, I just delete. So let's give some context for anybody who may not have
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.640]   watched the event. The Pixel 6 was the new phone. It's 5.99. The Pixel 6 is smaller, 6.2...
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.200]   6.1, I think. 6.1, less of a camera. I know, no third camera. No ultra wide band. I'm very
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   sad about that. And your option was also the Pixel 6 Pro for 8.99, bigger screen,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:59.680]   6.2 inches. But this is confusing. So explain this diagram. 6.2 inches tall,
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.480]   6.4 inches... Displaying maybe? Diagonal. Diagonal. Diagonal.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.000]   Okay. So it's 6.4. That is really a strange way to talk about it, but okay.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.840]   What color did you get, Stacey? I got the coral hoping it's less pink and more orange.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.080]   That's why I didn't go with it because I'm thinking it didn't look like this Pixel 4.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.800]   It was really fun. Well, I put a case on all my phones, so it doesn't really matter.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.240]   No, 5.99 is, by the way, I should point out, I think a very good price for a flagship phone.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.880]   Excellent. Super competitive. Yeah. I mean, it's half what the iPhone would cost.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.080]   So I think that's good. I think that's good.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   Millimeter wave, I don't know. I wouldn't. Now here's what Scooter X is saying. So
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   you could have it if you got it from Verizon or AT&T.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:12.000]   And it would cost... Yeah. Right. The version from the store is... 5.99 does not include millimeter wave.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   So... Okay. But Stacey... There's no millimeter wave in your neighborhood, is there?
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:25.920]   Okay. The ultra wideband millimeter wave is for finding things. It's just like...
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.560]   So we're talking about two different things. So there's UWB and there's millimeter wave.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.040]   So you're saying, I didn't know it didn't have you. I didn't even know it had UWB.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.920]   So it doesn't have... I need background on both of those. The millimeter wave is that 5G
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.480]   that they talk about that's super fast. Oh, that's the 5G millimeter wave. That's three blocks.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.560]   That's three blocks in New York and then one block in Philly and, you know, it's not very
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.120]   widespread and certainly nothing near you. So now let's talk about UWB because I didn't even
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.920]   realize these phones had UWB. Apple phones have... You promised us. Okay, interesting.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.400]   But I don't know if you're going to worry about that if nothing supports...
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.720]   No, the latest tiles have UWB on them. They just came out and I could really use the ability,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.360]   not $300 worth. There's going to be a theme throughout my thing today, which is like,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.280]   I want one feature that costs an exorbitant amount of money and I'm like, I'm not going to pay for it.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.080]   Yeah, $300 more. 8.99. This is the cheap Stacey show.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.240]   For the cheap Stacey. Stacey. That wasn't... So isn't that gonna be all...
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.000]   These friends cheap Stacey? I think it was.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.560]   Oh no, I'm sorry. That was cheap dates Stacey. I've got it wrong.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.920]   Oh, so rude. So rude.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:44.160]   Pixel 6 Pro is 8. I'm so sorry. I wasn't thinking of you. I was thinking of Barbie's friend.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.400]   There is a Stacey doll. There is. And she's awesome and tentately savvy and works for NASA.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.000]   There you go. As is the case when I grew up with Stacey dolls.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.120]   There you go. So Stacey, it's a Stacey Barbie, one of Barbie's younger sisters.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.240]   Light strawberry blonde hair, green eyes. She's a preteen and the most athletic of the Roberts.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.720]   Did you know that Barbie's last name is Roberts?
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.360]   This is her last name.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.600]   According to the Barbie, she was shared. According to the definitive Barbie wiki,
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.480]   Stacey Roberts.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.440]   Sporty Stacey. She's the Sporty one. Yeah, released in 1992. She's a tween doll.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.160]   I know she's believed to be 10 years old.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.360]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.840]   But the source has refused to confirm. Where did I?
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.640]   Well, a woman never tells her age.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.360]   Well, and she spells an Enronk, so we don't... We don't...
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.520]   People often confuse, by the way, Stacey for Tootie, the twin sister of Todd,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.920]   before Mattel discontinued her in 1971. Tootie was replaced by a girl named Kelly in the 1990
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.120]   wedding day midge gift set as the flower girl. Kelly's the cute tiny one.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.000]   Yes, Kelly became Todd's twin sister until Mattel renamed her Stacey in 1992. So you used to be
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.400]   Kelly. Who says the internet is an awful place? It's a place where people go to the
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.160]   effort to build the Barbie wiki. I mean, geez, what more could you ask for in society?
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.000]   Oh, Lord. Todd was discontinued in 1996. That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.280]   Nice, we're all out the Todd bold.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.520]   Oh my God, poor Todd.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:39.360]   Anyway, back to Pixel phones. You know who has a Pixel phone and talked a lot about it
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:45.040]   last night on all about Android? Google provided Jason Howell with both the Pixel and the Pixel.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.680]   That was a great reveal during the presentation. You know, funny, I was watching the presentation
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.600]   today rewatching. Two things really bug the hell out of me and I want to apologize to everybody.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:02.560]   At the beginning, I didn't realize this at the time, but Jason's trying to tell me he has it.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:10.000]   And I'm going, "Here comes Rick and I'll go to the other." So I feel, I'm sorry, Jason. I should
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.360]   have let you talk. I didn't know. Okay. The other problem is I was so irritated that I couldn't buy
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.600]   it, that I really wasn't paying attention. I kept interrupting by saying, "I can't buy the thing."
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:27.120]   I apologize to you. That was very... Jason just slowly moved it up into the frame.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.800]   It was very funny. He had it. It was like a jaws movement. Yeah. It was kind of great.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.160]   So it was quite joyous just watching you and Mr. Jarvis try to buy it. Try to buy it.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:45.840]   He is. Jason is embargoed on a full review and the most thing I'm most interested in is images
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.480]   until next week. So next week's all about Android. He'll have a full review for you, but he had a
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.000]   reveal and was able to talk about it in kind of general terms last night and all about Android.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.840]   Are you going to be allowed to take one little to Mexico? Well, it's so funny you should ask
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:07.760]   because mine arrives the day I leave. After. So which is a week from today. I won't be here next
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.640]   week by the way. I'll be in Mexico and Jason's going to take over the show.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   You got it. Sorry. But it would be perfect to bring with me because I'm going down to
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.240]   Oaxaca for the day of the dead, which will be... I mean, that's his photo James. You can get, right?
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.960]   And it would be wonderful to have that phone. Lisa's going to have the iPhone 13.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.120]   So I thought we could have a shoot off, you know? Yeah. And become a phone.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.160]   Lisa's will be better. If you had your phone, I was going to say, "Is she a better photographer?"
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.520]   She's a better photographer. I was going to say, "Give it to her."
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.200]   Yeah. Maybe I should take the iPhone 13 and let her have the Pixel Pro.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.880]   Wait, maybe you should just send Ant. Yeah. Or just send a real photographer.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.040]   I'm going to bring the Pixel 6 Pro if I can borrow it from Jason. But we got to check with
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.240]   Google because it's loaned out to him. He signed paperwork and stuff. So if that is possible,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.960]   I might do a swap. Otherwise, I'll have to wait. Mountain View may deliver our phones pretty quickly,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.000]   sir. I wish if anybody at Google's listening, I paid full dollar. It's not like we didn't
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.960]   order it. Apparently, some people... I tried to pay full dollar, but you wouldn't take my money.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.320]   So you still don't have one in order? You still don't have one? No, I have one, one 28, but I wanted
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.880]   the two of the six. Oh, you want more. So mine has delivered October 27th, the 28th. The funny
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:26.560]   thing is I also ordered very shortly thereafter the case, the Golden Globe case, and it is now
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:33.920]   pushed back to February 18th. I went to Amazon for my case. Yeah. So I said, I'm going to get one
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.920]   Friday from Amazon. It's like, "Oh, geez. I just went to the Google Store page.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.200]   They think they are a phone company. Due to high volumes, we may experience long wait times
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.280]   for customer support. We greatly appreciate your patience." Hey, Google, for God's sakes, people,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.760]   you had the hubris today. You could do anything. What happened to you? So you can't run a store?
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:01.120]   Google sold only about three and a half million of these last year. Total. And including, I think,
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:08.720]   the 5A, they ordered 7 million of the Pixel 6 this year. Double, that's the rumor. Double their
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.360]   sales figures from last year. So they're very bullish on this. Jason was saying during the
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.120]   event that they have spent and plan to spend even more, a lot of marketing money on this,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.520]   that they're really going to push this phone. But it's interesting because even if they sell 7
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.600]   million phones next year, or between now and next year, that's like one week's worth of my phone.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.960]   I mean, it's a tiny number compared to Samsung and Apple.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:40.400]   What do you think Google's ambitions are here? I mean, even their most optimistic projection is
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.920]   still a fraction of the competition. I think it's showing off the new chip and what it can do.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.200]   Yeah, seems like that would be the most important thing in this story. It's just their capabilities
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   for AI and all of it being on their own silicon. So are they happy if you don't buy one, but just
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   that you see people with them and you see the ads and you get that general glow around Google.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:09.440]   A couple of phones, right? It's just the services of Google versus the services of having a Pixel
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.480]   device. So are we weird? And by the way, it's not just us. It's Paul and Mary Jo on the Windows
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.560]   Weekly. I mean, we all bought one. We all like one. I got to get it. Is that just like,
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.960]   are we kind of outliers? Lemons? We are definitely outliers.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.320]   Okay. Normal people are clamoring. But it was, I mean, this could be like an apple. I mean,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.560]   the thing is what pisses me off is if it's like an Apple store where they create the fake lines,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.840]   then we're manipulated. But maybe they just had amazing sales. Maybe it surprised them. Maybe
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.480]   people liked it and wondered it. And part of the thing too is that because it was not a surprise,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.680]   people didn't have to think and wait, they knew everything they needed to know. They were ready
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.480]   to buy the minute it was available. That's actually a very good point. Also, if you order by the
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.640]   end of the month, you get Pixel Bud's A series, just what you always wanted, Jeff.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.960]   I paid for the damn things because of Jason Howell. I got them. And then
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:10.880]   now I have two. I have four of them. Oh my. Well, one for each year. Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.760]   And other Orifices.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:24.080]   So I wonder if this jam at the website, I mean, look it, there's no way Google wanted this. They
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.200]   did not create artificially, you know, this this bog down website because they sell internet
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.160]   services. They sell web services. It doesn't reflect well on their capabilities. There's no
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.400]   way they're going to besmirch their reputation on purpose. I wonder though why they weren't better
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:50.240]   prepared. It's not their forte still. It is that but that's the point it is they
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.920]   claim to be a czar with a networking company. We don't know if it's like shopping sites.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.760]   Shopping. That could be something. I mean, there's a lot.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.960]   If there's a lot that goes into hosting a. Oh, I understand. But
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:10.160]   shopping site that Google doesn't do normally. They've had a store for years.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.560]   Yeah, but I don't know how many did you all at the same time?
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:21.440]   Size to three of us, four of us. We all just jammed the store. That's all just the three of us.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:27.120]   But still, actually, I didn't. I waited until the afternoon. Pretty quickly.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.280]   When are you getting yours, Stacy? Delivery October 30th through
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.160]   number second. So I guess there was there was no real rush.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:40.320]   Really, the problem it sounds like was not a rush of people but bad software because
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.240]   they were saying it was sold out and it wasn't. They were saying it would be delivered in February
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.640]   than it wasn't. People are already starting to get new emails saying, oh, no, no, we're going to
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:55.680]   have it next week, not next year. I think Google might have had a software issue as much as anything
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.280]   else. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they had a database that just didn't update or something.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.520]   Maybe. Well, first, the entire site was down. We got 500 errors.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.800]   And then you finally got the page load very slowly. And then it was difficult for the process.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.160]   And then those of us who got to a cart and many did not. I was afraid I was a human
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   DDoS because I kept on hitting refresh. And it would give it an R real one error.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.880]   R-O-15. And then go back and back. And then finally, when I got to the next stage,
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.280]   that's when it said, oh, sorry, shmuck, gone. Yeah, this sounds like a software problem.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.920]   But interesting, your choice, the cloudy white version is already out of stock.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.160]   Not even delayed. Did it? Yes, it did. The others you can get. Let's see if I decide.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.720]   That's under your five page or is that I think it's not a stock more than that on the regular.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.040]   This is the regular page. Really? Let me see if I can get a 256 gig. I do not want to trade
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:08.960]   in my phone. I do not want any of this stuff. Look how nice and smoothly the software is working.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:15.360]   Let's just say add to cart. Let's go to the cart. Let's just buy this son of a gun.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:23.600]   Hey, check out. Why can't I do that? It's like it's saying for me. It's out of stock and it's
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.000]   been removed from your cart. Yeah, yeah, that's a little late to tell me that.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.240]   It is right. Why did you go that far? It tells me when it's not available.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.360]   No, it was right away. Right away.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.280]   Oh, now I'm feeling like maybe I should have gotten sort of C-phone.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.800]   What happens when you have the green is pretty? It is kind of pretty. It is kind of pretty.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.880]   It is pretty. Sort of C-phone sort of pretty. It's the kind of phone Stacey Roberts would have.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:59.760]   Wow. See, and I'm actually having seen. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I like this actually. You're right.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:05.040]   It's pretty. I do. I'm glad colors are kind of Stacey colors. They're good Stacey colors. Yeah.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.680]   Actually, I wish I had the accents on the button. It's like the previous models too.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:16.400]   Yeah. I love my little orange buttons. Oh, that was fun. The two tone. Yeah.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.720]   Well, really ultimately what it comes down to is is this tent sword ship going to be as
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.840]   everything Google's talking about is are the cameras going to be as good as I hope so too.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.680]   I had the images processing the I mean there's a lot of stuff in here that looks and it would
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.320]   be great to bring it to Mexico because of the translation. Did you love it? They had Marie
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:45.840]   Kondo on the event translating her and it sparked joy and I thought that was kind of cool.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.400]   That looked great. She's like throw away your own phones. Yeah. So I'm curious because
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.520]   let me ask you, aunt, did you know who Marie Kondo was? I did because of the grapevine.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.720]   I never watched a show though. Yeah. I wonder. It maybe a lot of people do. It seems to me that
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   if Google's having Marie Kondo in their event, it's almost a way of saying look how
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:17.200]   not geeky we are, right? Kind of how I get that. I get that more. I feel like she's the Google
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.360]   of cleaning though. Like she is the uber geek of cleaning. Like her method is pretty. Yeah,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.040]   she's a low CD, isn't she? Yeah. Yeah. And when you go into like target is a target now that all
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   the Bri condo products, it's kind of the container. She's very mean. She's the she's the Ariana of
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.840]   throw it away. And stream. That's the word. Yeah. Or the Martha Stewart Martha Stewart. Well,
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:43.760]   the steward brother, the steward I mean. Well, you're talking about me, baby. I don't know who
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.160]   you're talking about. All right.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:54.240]   Thurman is playing Ariana Huffington perfect in the zoom. I mean, the uber movie.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.680]   Wait a minute. There's a movie about uber. There's there's a series about uber.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:06.720]   Yes. Kind of like about Steve Gibson. Really? It's it's in the rundown. Are they calling it
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:17.360]   a halt and catch fire? Actually, it was called a great line. 132 sir. 132. Let's jump down.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:24.240]   Big O way to the end of the show. This is a story from deadline. Super pumped. Uma Thurman
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:30.080]   joins Showtime anthology. His book. Oh, it's from Mike Isaac's book. Good for you, Mike.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.200]   Super pumped. The battle for uber. Showtime's super pumped. See, I think people are going to
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.080]   see that title and think it's something else. It sells the story of the ride sharing company.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   Wow. Pivoting live it. Kyle Chandler from the billions co-creators, Brian Kalman and
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.120]   David. Oh, this is going to be good. Gordon Levitt plays Travis Kalinek. Wow.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.840]   And this is going to be something Thurman's going to be board member Ariana Huffington.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.760]   Elizabeth Shoe, Carrie Bichay, John Bass. So good cast. Yeah. And I love, I mean, you know,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.840]   this is a good team. Billions is a great show. And they're very good at showing how rich people,
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.480]   how the other half lives, which seems to be a thing now on TV.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.240]   Well, you know, I was thinking today, where's our so we've got a spire. Yeah, something to look
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:28.160]   forward to as we it was we declined. Even this is all dystopian, right? Where's our
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.800]   Hill Street blues are, St. Elsewhere, our West Wing, our hopeful shows? No, it's billions
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.480]   and succession and super pumped. It's all everybody's a mess. There's head lasso.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.720]   Yeah, Jason today is going to be on Saturday Night Live Saturday to 10.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:50.080]   Lasso is awesome. I haven't watched somebody said that to me on Twitter. I have not watched
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.760]   it. I confess. Okay, Jeff, I can't imagine you. I imagine you throwing things at the time.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.800]   Oh, yeah. That's the girl. I was going to make him cranky. Yeah.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.960]   It's got nothing like a soccer. It's not about soccer. It's a it's about it's a
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.640]   saccharine sweet homilies. It's a more channel. Yeah, it's a hallmark channel. Oh, no. He makes
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:19.440]   a hallmark channel. He makes butter cookies. Okay, he gets a divorce. It's a life lesson.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:26.320]   By the way, he's depressed for like one second. And then he just goes on and makes more butter
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.680]   cookies. So I don't know if he's that. No, he has a panic attack. Oh, he does. Okay, good for him.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.760]   Good for him. Really? Did you just say that?
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.680]   By the way, we were a little concerned because this was a tough week. We got Apple
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:47.280]   on Monday announcing new computers. We got Google announcing a new phone on Tuesday.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.000]   And then this morning at seven a.m., Jason, Helen, are going back and forth. Should we get up at seven
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.040]   a.m. for the Samsung unpacked to event? You have both decided the day before not to.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:04.960]   We have decided not to. No, that was the decision. And I'm glad we didn't because the entirety of
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:12.160]   the event was now you can customize your galaxy Z flip three in colors. It's like the
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.920]   motor. That's all they announced. The motor maker. I have that, but I have it in a boring color.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.080]   Black. Well, do you think that would be better or worse than the pixel?
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.800]   No, no, I'm getting the pixel six for one reason, the camera. But I do, I am interested in what
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.400]   they'll do with the tensor chip. The galaxy flip is a great little phone, but it's just another
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.640]   phone. It's not, you know, world beating. And cameras are good, not great as maybe it's the
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:48.400]   photographer. But as Ant pointed out, the white balance is off. Still hurts. Still hurts, Ant.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:59.600]   I'm not gonna lie. I'm sorry for the standards. Distinger. Oh, God. Oh, okay. Sorry, I have
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:07.760]   standards. What can I say? Well, okay. And tomorrow is Google's smart home summit.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.320]   Tomorrow at 10 AM. Oh, now tell us what should we watch that? What should we do with that?
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:19.840]   I don't know. That's their smart home event. I don't. Will you be watching it?
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:26.400]   So at 10 AM, I will be getting my face shut up with Botox. Oh, well, there are important,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:32.080]   more important things. There will be live streams of it. So we could watch it. If you're
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.800]   interested, but I'm just letting you know that that is also coming. And I'm hopeful that we'll
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:46.960]   hear about matter. Matter is the joint venture between Google Zigbee, a bunch of other home
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:53.120]   automation apples involved in matter. Everybody Apple Amazon Amazon's in it too. All right.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:00.640]   Amazon Google smart home summit live stream. Michelle Turner. Or no, I'm sorry, Mikaela
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:08.480]   Turner. Michelle. Michelle Turner will share our vision for the home and preview upcoming
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:14.320]   tools and features to build your next devices and apps using matter and thread.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.720]   Yeah, I don't think it's it's not a it's for developers. It's for devs. It's a developer event.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:27.440]   Yeah. Well, it's going to be long. It's not two hours is two hours and 17.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.600]   So what 10 AM to 12, 17 PM.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:42.880]   So you might have time to get your face shot up and come home after you get your face shot up.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.680]   Can you watch TV or do you have to go to bed? No, no, I can totally watch TV.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   So I write a newsletter after it. Oh, that must be the fun newsletter.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:02.560]   And another thing about IOT. It's just one talks in my. I know I feel like it should make your
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.320]   brain freeze up or something. Yeah, it kills things. Your brain isn't freeze up. Okay. And we
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:14.160]   should say not that it's anybody's business, but Stacy isn't doing this for vanity. It helps with
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.560]   migraines and it's a way you do this every time. Yeah, because I don't want people to think
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.680]   you're doing this for vanity. Hey, you could be do lots of things for vanity. Okay. And I'm okay
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.600]   with that. I have to say your your slash syrup, your brow is completely unfurrowed. I mean,
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:41.360]   it is. I can't move my eye. I'm sorry. Yeah, I don't I don't know how people get it in the rest
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.000]   of their face because it does hurt a lot. This is a serious question, actually.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.240]   How do you show concern when you can't move your brow?
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Well, Jeff, I'm really sorry about that. Yeah, no, no, she doesn't care.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.440]   That's a dead doesn't work.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:11.680]   And and and and the chat room is is badgering me about the Sony camera,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:17.120]   which is coming on the tomorrow. So they're going to have an event with the alpha.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.920]   But I can say I'm every event pre recorded now. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, has to be. I have to say,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:30.320]   I don't think that's a bad thing. I think the pre record events are more efficient. They get to
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.040]   the point. I don't miss the live events, particularly. They can also just put on a press release.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:41.360]   Well, I miss being live at a live event. Yeah, I mean, but that's but that's a privileged position
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.000]   that, you know, we have no, not me, but yeah, we miss the privilege you guys have.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.480]   Yeah, I just miss being in person and like being able to have hands on a device.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.920]   Yeah, you can tell a lot more about it. That's true. And just exactly.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.960]   You know, you also can, as a journalist, you can talk to people afterwards who are
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   not journalists and be like, Hey, it was that exciting? And it's much easier than just emailing
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:09.520]   everybody. And I don't know. I like seeing people. I miss them. I never thought I'd say that.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:15.360]   I know it's not as much. Yeah, but I do miss being able to put hands on the product cities at
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.680]   events or even like like Adobe Maxis next week, I miss going to that because it was being able to
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.360]   sit down with those other creators and pick their brains right there.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:36.320]   I think that the biggest problem I see with these is these events look much more like marketing
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.240]   than ever before. Maybe that's just because they're not wolves and sheep clothing anymore.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.640]   They're just wolves because it was always really an exercise in marketing, but they really look
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.680]   like both Apple's event on Monday and Google's event yesterday just didn't, especially Google's
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.760]   event because there was nothing new to say. They didn't do a folding phone. They didn't have anything
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.960]   that we didn't already know. It just looked like an ad, you know, a program length commercial.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.360]   So that's the disadvantage of recorded, at least if it's live, there's some, I don't know.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.640]   If it's live, there's that there's always that thread of something going wrong.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.400]   You know, they're doing that. Yeah, a little tension. Yeah, it's not bad.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.840]   Hey, let's take a little break. Go ahead. No, no, I don't want to say you get less.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.080]   If you were images of like Tim Cook in a field, which is what happened. That was a little odd.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:32.480]   He was like, cold in knee high weeds. Yeah. I got some serious cold vibes. I was like,
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.280]   I was like, huh? What's going on here?
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.320]   Yeah. Anyway, all right. It did give us the opportunity to make the pun that Tim Cook was
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.120]   outstanding in his field, but that was about it. Somebody said, maybe Apple's announcing a new lawn mower.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:55.920]   That's actually, I wish a new bill here. You can't have they're not able to sell those
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.960]   two stroke mowers or blowers and stuff. That's true. Yeah, maybe Apple should make a new Apple
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:08.800]   it's the leaf blowers you can't use. Leaf blowers and weed wackers and stuff like that.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.560]   Actually, I wish you'd been with me Stacey on Monday because I thought the chip news from Apple
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:22.320]   was very, very interesting. I have so many thoughts. And if you want, you can convince me to try to
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.880]   buy something. So there you go. Well, it's only if you're into chips. What was interesting to me,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.800]   and I don't know if there's a precedent for it. I wish I had more background in this,
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.640]   but they showed the M1 die. It's not a diet system on a chip, so it's not fair to call it a die,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.840]   because there's memory in there. There's lots of stuff in there, but they show the thing, the SOC.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:49.360]   And the new one is then about 50%, and then twice as big with a max. And I think that that's
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.920]   fairly unprecedented to make that kind of leap in a year in processing power and in transistors
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:02.080]   and capabilities. They doubled the speed of a chip that was one year old. Intel has never,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.160]   as far as I know, never done that in such a short time frame. This is remarkable.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:15.440]   But it's the SOC. It's not the actual chip. It's misleading to say 32 billion transistors,
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.240]   because it's included RAM and everything else. Yeah, because when you have an SOC,
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.160]   you can have your CPU, right? And then you can add as many GPUs.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.440]   Well, and the RAM is on there, right? The GPUs in there. Yeah.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.560]   Nevertheless, I thought it was quite a talk about memory.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.920]   It was quite a bit of flex on Apple's part to say you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:43.040]   People were impressed with the M1. I think the M1 Pro and Max show that Apple has a lot of headroom
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.960]   in its chip design. And I'm very much interested what they're going to do next year for the
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:53.440]   Mac Pro and the iMac. I think that this is moving faster than anybody anticipated, I guess is what
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:59.360]   I'm saying. Okay. What do you think? Yeah, I have a lot. Okay. Oh, I thought we were going for a
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.120]   break, but I will do. Well, we are, but actually, I can't drop this now because I really curious
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.360]   what you think. Okay. Well, here we go. So I thought their emphasis on memory bandwidth was
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.760]   really important. And the reason why is because that is the constraint on the chip in terms of
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.480]   getting data to the processor, right? And if you think about all the workloads, all the jobs we're
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:23.520]   asking our computers to do with machine learning, with graphics, all of that, that requires a lot
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.320]   of memory bandwidth, a lot of moving data around the chip. So historically, we haven't cared about
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   that. But this is a sign that even in consumers, like every machine that we have going forward,
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   that's going to be way more important than like,
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:43.280]   RAM or I mean, still to be super important, but way more important than like, the amount of
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.880]   RAM you have. Yeah. Yeah. And it helps with GPUs. I mean, one of the concerns I had with Apple
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.000]   moving to its own silicon is they're waving by Biden video and AMD. They're going to have to come
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.200]   up with something. Yeah, they built a graphic style chip in the sense that it can handle all of those
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:08.000]   data flows on the same piece of silicon and handle all the memory bottlenecking issues that happen,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.320]   have happened historically when you move from parallel like move to parallel processing,
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.720]   like you do on a GPU, they built their own network fabric for that thing. That is amazing. This is
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:26.240]   what NVIDIA has made their GPUs so great is because their network fabric has been good at
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:32.320]   parallel processing. You could push 200 gigabytes, 200 gigabytes a second over the memory
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:39.840]   channels, giga bits per second, gigabytes capital B. Oh, that's the amount of data. Sorry. Yes.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.040]   Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. That's the memory bandwidth. So this is really remarkable, I think.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.960]   And then they doubled it. And then so the other thing to note from this is Apple is designing these
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:58.640]   for a future where every computer becomes a gaming computer, not to play games, but because of the
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:04.080]   future of AR and you can call it the metaverse, call it whatever you want. So that's what is
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.400]   exciting about this. So we're seeing Apple, it didn't do any, it didn't do any like Wicked Awesome
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:18.800]   AR launches recently. But this chip is like boom, working on it. I think that's exactly what the
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:25.520]   Mac break weekly crew has been saying, which is what especially Alex Lindsey is the is this
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.720]   interesting to what we've been wondering, but why Apple stuff the phone, the iPad and now
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:37.280]   their computers are so overpowered for what it's doing today. And it really looks like Apple's
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:44.240]   putting the pieces into place one after the other so that in a year or two, it's all going to come
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.440]   together with some, you know, a brand new way to use your computers, which is this augmented reality.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:56.320]   So I agree with you. I think that's for, I don't know, five, six years now with unifying the two OSS.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:02.720]   Yeah, it takes a while. It takes a while. You can't change our textures. Mac OS.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.120]   Well, but they've been limited also by and this is what they finally, I think, got tired of what
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:14.480]   Intel was giving them. And while Intel was stuck at 10 nanometers or even more, this is a five nanometer
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.680]   chip. They're going to go to three nanometers probably next year. And it's not merely the nanometers,
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:26.240]   these are multi dimensional chips. There's technology in here that, you know, and this is the other
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.640]   thing I think is interesting that it may be the case that Intel and AMD are just going to look at
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:37.120]   and dream of, but not actually produce. So I think they're lapping Intel and AMD and even
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.200]   armed to some degree in a way that's really interesting. And this is a company that doesn't,
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.880]   the chips aren't its business. But because they are their business is the whole stack now,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:53.840]   the hardware, the chips, the software, the operating system, they're really going to be able to do
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:59.120]   something unique. Now there is a negative to that, which is it's not open. It's very closed. It's a
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.960]   closed ecosystem. But it's the only way you could do a stack like this. And I think it's that's why
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:09.040]   that it's going to be hard for Intel to come along and do it. They don't own the whole ecosystem.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:15.840]   Well, this could be why Google is so adamant about keeping up with the pixels and putting
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:23.760]   exactly now most of their infrastructure is cloud. But I think it's probably smart of them to realize
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.080]   that server chips are not going to be in these edge devices. So you've got to build your own
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.240]   silicon for these edge devices, even if you're not super awesome on the phone, because you need
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:38.080]   to know what those workloads are going to demand and look like and have the capability to build
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.160]   for them. Yeah, somebody like me who covers both companies, it looks pretty much like Google is
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.600]   attempting to follow Apple's playbook. Apple says we're going to do everything on device to
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.400]   protect your privacy. That's what the tensor chip is all about. Apple says we're going to put ML,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.600]   image processing and more into our phones. That's what the tensorship is all about.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.120]   And I think that that's exactly, I think you're right. I think Google's trying to build the same
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.760]   kind of expertise. And that, you know, that question I asked earlier, why is Google putting all their
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:16.800]   eggs in this pixel basket? And I think that's why it's not merely to become a giant phone company,
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.040]   but it's because they need to own this technology stack to compete. And ultimately,
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.680]   when Apple comes out with an AR device, I think Google hopes to be right behind them.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:31.440]   So does Google supply chips to know others then so that they can have the same capabilities?
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:37.920]   No, Android? No, although it's unclear. Google's not clear about this. I think Samsung has a big
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:43.200]   hand in the tensor chip. I'm almost certain manufacturer them, but I'm not sure they may also.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:48.160]   But how can Google win if they make 7 million phones? Because it's not about the phone in the
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.880]   long run. It's not going to be about the phone in the long run. Yeah, the phone is just
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.400]   packaging. Yeah, but it is about the ability to use AI locally. Yes. So,
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   okay, go ahead, Stacey. So they're getting the experience. They understand what kind of
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:09.440]   demands people have on those phones. They get all of that so they can optimize their chip for
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:15.520]   those workloads. And yeah, but mostly they share that. Well, I'm trying to see how it scales. Do
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:23.040]   they share that knowledge openly? Do they share specs? Do they open source things? How does
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:30.560]   if it's Google v apple here and the chip technology is critical to that and Google can't make it
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.360]   alone on its own manufacturing and its own phones, that's what I'm trying to understand is how does
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.200]   it then how does Google then expand as Android did by making it free? Do they do the same thing
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:45.440]   with the tensor chip? Oh, I see what you're asking. I guess they could. That is
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.040]   a potential avenue for them to do it like to open it. I mean,
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:58.480]   the Google chip is based on the arm architecture license as is the apple chips. So they have highly
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:04.400]   customized arm chips. Now arm is not open source. So Google could never open source. You can't do
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.360]   that. Tensor chips. Now with risk five, I'm sure there's some engineers running around and they
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.800]   could release something like that going forward. I really have high hopes for risk five,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:21.360]   risk five, but I have a sinking feeling it's not going to be competitive with the best that even
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:27.120]   Intel can produce let alone apple and Google. Why is that? It doesn't need to be the best. The
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.920]   best at what? That's what's so fun about chips today is you've got so many disparate jobs and
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.960]   workloads out there used to only do one thing, which is power PC that did like 10 things, right?
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.440]   Now you've got computers and everything. So they all need different levels of processors
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.560]   and they're going to be running a million different ones as opposed to like.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:50.000]   And the apple chips, some of you even said they're swift machines. The apple chips
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.280]   are designed, we're a very specific hardware and software stack all owned by apple.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.000]   You can't do that with risk V. You can't Intel can't do that arm can't do that.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Samsung maybe could do that, you know, because they do make hardware. They kind of make software.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:12.720]   Apple's a unique and uniquely positioned in this, frankly. And the other thing,
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.920]   Jeff and one this is the phone is an interim product. I think Apple and Google both are
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.600]   the way to the blob. Yeah, are looking toward the blob maybe towards some sort of AR spectacles.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:31.120]   The metaverse. Well, speaking of which Facebook wants to change his name, that's our subject
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.800]   when we return in just a little bit. They see hidden bottoms good to have you back. I've been
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.240]   I was I'm just I'm like, need Stacy. We need Stacy. So she's back.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.760]   We don't really need Jeff Jarvis, but he's here. What can we do? So
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:50.480]   I know I'm gonna assume and try to get back. Remember last week, I thank God you were there
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.280]   because I'm just going like all I can do when Corey doctor of launches is go. So Jeff, I just
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.440]   shut up to thank you. Actually, I put stuff from last week's run down into this. Yeah,
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.560]   yeah. We don't do anything. Couple good ones there. There's no chance of getting anything
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.360]   last. No, no, no, but you were good. You asked him questions. You brought up stuff.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:11.200]   His brain goes fast. Very hard to keep up with. So were you two and thanks thanks to you and
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.280]   Jeff. I didn't have to do so much last week. And Pruitt's also here hands on photography. Our
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.880]   show. I want to actually this is really exciting. Brand new a sponsor. I want to tell you about
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:29.680]   called andela and D L A and Della really neat idea. Brilliant is evenly distributed.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:37.920]   Globally, brilliance is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not. And really, and Della is there
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:45.440]   to solve that problem. You need talent. There's talent out there might not be down the block.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:51.280]   And Della is a global talent network with a mission to connect brilliance with opportunity.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.360]   These days, your company is expected to move faster than ever before. I mean, staying ahead
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.960]   of the competition has never been so hard. Talent has never been so hard to find with so many
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.360]   priorities to manage. How are you supposed to find time to both build an onboard and amazing
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:11.120]   engineering team that will get you where you need to go? And Della has solved this problem.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.480]   And Della is the world's first talent network connecting innovative companies like yours with
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:24.320]   top-tiered vetted engineers, really good talented people. So you have more time to focus on your core
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:30.480]   business. And Della is committed to your success with their combination of expert technical recruiters,
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:36.240]   proprietary matching algorithms. They connect you with developers who are the best in the business,
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.280]   enabling you to accelerate productivity, drive revenue, and scale your business.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:49.520]   This is not the offshore developers that you're thinking. This is something so much better. Yes,
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:55.040]   you get the benefits of developers distributed globally, both in time zones. You can work around
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.360]   the clock. The prices are better. But you also get a global network of talent that is rigorously
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:07.120]   vetted. And Della knows you need the best talent. Their hiring process is quick and efficient,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.280]   but maintains the highest quality admission standards. So you're really getting top quality
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:18.000]   engineers at scale, global talent at your fingertips. And today's hyper-competitive hiring environment,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:24.480]   if you limit yourself to just the people in your region, you're at a big disadvantage,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:30.880]   you may have already experienced that. There's a talent drain. Why raid the company across the
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.120]   street when there's such a huge pool of highly qualified talent around the world? But you need
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.680]   to end Della to find them and to help you with all of this. And that's what they do. You can
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.560]   cut your hiring timelines down for months. Today's, they understand companies have to do more with
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:52.080]   less and consistently justify our ROI. When you hire and Della engineers, you can expect they'll
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:58.480]   be in already be efficiently onboarded and ready to deliver value for your team within days. Very
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:04.080]   efficient ramp up times. And it's not, you know, part time support, somebody you're going to call
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.200]   up in the middle of the night. These people are embedded. They're in your organization, fully embedded
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.880]   with at least five hours of overlapping working hours. So the rest of your engineering team.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.800]   So you can talk to them. I am a big believer in this because I know in fact, Alex Lindsey has
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.520]   always talked about these great engineering talents that he's worked with and trained in
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.800]   countries like Rwanda and Africa. And he's always said this to me and it really resonated when I
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:40.320]   talk to and Della. Brilliant is global, but the opportunity is not. So here's your opportunity
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:45.040]   to take advantage of brilliant engineers from all over the world. I'll give you a good example,
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.600]   a company called Mindshare, maybe you know them, they partnered with and they needed to quickly
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.640]   hire 10 new digital experts. And I'm talking data scientists, machine learning specialists,
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.080]   analysts, developers. Here's what the executive director and head of business intelligence
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.520]   at Mindshare said, as we continue to enhance the synapse platform, time to value is very
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.000]   important. And Della is a good partner in helping us identify the right talent that's fit for
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.720]   different purposes. This is your opportunity to tap into a wider talent pool, stop competing
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:22.400]   with the major tech companies down the street, spend less time interviewing. Brilliant says,
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:28.400]   I love that line. I want to write it on my wall. Brilliant is evenly distributed, but opportunity
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:33.520]   isn't. Well, now we can flatten that level that playing field. And it's good for you. It's good
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:42.880]   for everybody. Here's the website and Della and D L A dot com slash four dash companies. Okay,
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:49.360]   four dash companies and Della dot com slash four dash companies. You can schedule a complimentary
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.520]   consultation. In fact, you can even get a two week no risk trial with their vetted technical talent.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:59.680]   You could try them out. Little audition and Della and D L A dot com slash four dash companies. I'm
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.240]   just very excited about the mission of end Della and what they're doing. It's really, really,
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:13.600]   really cool. Check it out and Della dot com slash four dash companies. This was the headline that kind
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:21.280]   of knocked me out of my seat when I saw it. Facebook is planning to rebrand the company with a new name.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:27.920]   So that's one way to get out of your problems. Got a kind of stinky brand reputation. Well,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:34.400]   just put a mustache on, but a mustache on. It worked for Phillip Morris. Oh, yeah. I mean,
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:39.360]   it's I can think of a lot of companies. There's another play from the big tobacco playbook.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:46.000]   I mean, Exxon did this, right? I mean, it's over and over. This is a very common thing to do.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.520]   We're going to find out more about this on the 28th next week at the Connect Conference.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:02.240]   The I'm just kind of stunned. It's meant to signal the tech. This is from the Verge.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:08.960]   The tech giants ambition to be known for more than social media and all the ills that it
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:15.440]   tells the rebrand would likely. We're not big tobacco. The rebrand would likely position the
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.160]   blue Facebook app is one of many products under apparent company, kind of like alphabet.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:29.040]   Overseeing groups like Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and more. So no idea what this is going to be,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.200]   although I was trying to wonder whether this we got there. There were punchlines online. One
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:40.480]   is the Facebook has to send it. It's real identity and driver's license. That was somebody else's
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:47.920]   joke not my dad's a rut. But Twitter wags came out. Is is is there any chance here that this is a
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:57.280]   kicking zuck upstairs moment? Well, if Zuck didn't have absolute iron grip on voting control.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:03.520]   But so did Larry and Sergey. They chose to move. They kicked themselves. It was. I'm saying,
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:08.800]   we have to be stuck doing that. Yeah, you know, you might. He's got kids. So does he say Chris Cox?
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.920]   Ha ha. It's your problem now. He's as rich as you can figure it out.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:18.960]   There's some speculation. The Verge has some speculation. I'll give credit to Alex Heath
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.480]   in his article that maybe the name might have something to do with Horizon. This is a
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:32.800]   product Facebook's been working on in VR for a while. Horizon Worlds. Horizon would be a good name,
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:37.840]   right? Because they're looking ahead over the horizon. My favorite joke was it's got to go back
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:47.120]   to the Facebook. Because remember, Mark said metaverse is our next, you know, big focus.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:52.800]   Can we just put a put a parenthesis in here? Because I put something to run down a month ago
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:55:01.200]   and I never defined the metaverse for me, please. Stacy, you're the. Nope. Nope.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:08.560]   Conda. Ha ha ha. Not gonna do it. Some autocyfi nerds love.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:15.040]   Well, my experience in the metaverse is from sci-fi exactly. Neil Stevenson's Snow Crash is
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:21.120]   probably the first. Of course, very famously, William Gibson and Nuro Manser talked about a
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:27.360]   metaverse. The most recent version is, you know, Ready Player One. If you saw the movie, you read
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:35.200]   the book, that's an in general, the notion is it is an indistinguishable virtual world,
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:42.800]   indistinguishable from the real world that people spend much of their time in another alternate world
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:49.680]   that is entirely digitally generated. Second life. Yeah, but second life is an immersive and so
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.720]   that's a very important part that indistinguishable from real world. It's got to be immersive. It's
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:03.280]   got to be as close to the real world as possible. Yeah. You agree Stacy? Yes. And that you will do
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.640]   more than just entertain yourself. That's I think the other layer there that's important. You will
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:15.120]   conduct regular life in this. This will be business. This will be a payment. This will be because
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.320]   you're not alone in it. You're in the metaverse just as you are in the real world with other people.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.280]   Maybe that maybe in a way running the metaverse who's handling infrastructure.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.920]   By the way that in almost all of these sci-fi novels plays an important part of the story is
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.520]   like, well, who's the shade the shadowy, eminent, greased behind the metaverse, you know, who's
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:44.080]   running it usually mega corporations like Facebook. And I have to say, I'm sure Zuck is very much
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.200]   influenced by sci-fi. He looks like somebody who's read a few sci-fi novels in his time.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.120]   And so if he says metaverse, you know, it's because it's informed by this notion starting with Neil
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   Stevenson and William Gibson and the more recent versions of it. It's certainly been a big part of
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.040]   sci-fi for decades. Okay, but now so now bring it down to earth if we may.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:14.320]   What does that mean in Facebook strategic plans? What's the product then? What's the reality of this?
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.680]   That's what I can't get into. So you would pay probably to be on the metaverse. People
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.400]   advertisers would be able to reach you. You'd have digital real estate that you could sell to
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.760]   like people. So if you want to be and think about if think about kind of like in second life,
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   you know, they're like, I hated second life. But that's because it wasn't very well done.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:39.600]   So here's here's I think probably the thinking Mark has there's a scarcity
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.760]   in the world. There's a scarcity of real estate. There's a scarcity there used to be a scarcity
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:50.800]   of advertising because there were only three networks and you know how many newspapers and
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.600]   you know there was a scarcity. One of the things digital has done is it's eliminated the scarcity
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.400]   and advertising placement. You could now there's almost an infinite number of places you could put
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:08.560]   advertisements, right? But there's still this scarcity of physical space. So I think just as
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:13.920]   digital advertising has changed the advertising world, Zuck wants to do the same with the physical
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:18.320]   world. And I think it's not even to own it. There's a that there is in fact, I mean,
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:24.480]   it's the AOL. It's it's the walled garden of Facebook or or any of these. But in a
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.920]   wouldn't a metaverse be the opposite? It's a yes based on the internet. It's distributed and it's
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:35.280]   and it's open and there's no way. Oh no. Wait a minute. You said two words. It is not distributed and
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:41.600]   open. Okay. Well, it might be distributed, but it could be. I would you and I would like to see
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.320]   that just like we'd like to see distributed open web, but here's how it's going to develop
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:52.320]   possibly. This is I think highly likely. You will have a Facebook metaverse and maybe you start
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.720]   out spending time there because that's where you hang out with your friends. You're also going to
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:59.280]   have a professional metaverse and that's where your office picks it. What's going to happen is
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:04.640]   they're going to have to build links between these meta the metaverses where you can just traverse
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:11.840]   set of on them and bring your data with you that matters. So that's how I think it's going to end
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:18.160]   up developing. There's one other aspect of metaverse in science fiction that I hope does not
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.920]   translate it to the real world metaverse, which is that almost always it's people escaping from
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:29.200]   a dystopian reality. So yeah, I was I was going to bring that up. I was like, I think in addition to
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.800]   scarcity, we're going to have I mean, if you think about kind of the havoc that will be wrecked by
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:41.760]   climate change, if you think about like our lives becoming increasingly miserable in the physical
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:47.920]   and real world, you will want to escape for and depending on how good our technology gets. I mean,
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:53.200]   imagine if you can taste things that you can no longer access in the real world. That's a really
[00:59:53.200 --> 01:00:00.480]   good reason to want to be in the metaverse. I'm always figured, given my age, that I will at some
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.680]   point in the next 20 years be in the home, that let's hope it's a nursing home out of San
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:12.240]   Antitrist. My father and two. Yeah. And limited mobility, maybe limited cognitive functions,
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.920]   certainly, and I have to go to the bathroom more often. So the idea of putting on something that
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:24.240]   transports me to a cafe in Paris will be more than welcome, right? Quite nice, right? Yeah.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.720]   I mean, it's kind of like you're getting to the matrix. We're just going to be logged into these
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:34.480]   things and imagining a better life for ourselves. All right, odds that odds that in our lifetime,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:41.360]   we actually could come back together after episode 4,673 and say, yep, there's a better
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.880]   verse all right. Or no, wasn't that funny? No, I think we're heading directly there.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.000]   Yeah, we're going to have that. I don't know if you'll be alive when the
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.040]   or whether we like it science fiction. It won't be the holodeck yet. That's another
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.360]   metaverse, by the way, this from the Star Trek. You version 2.0. And if the telcos build it,
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.320]   we're going to have to pay for every minute that we're in there. Right.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.920]   I mean, this is a perfect example where it would be so awesome if it were federated,
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.440]   if it were open, if it weren't owned by any one company and if you could build and create
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.960]   yourself, but that ain't going to happen because there's so much investment that goes into this.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.840]   And I think Google wants to be part of this. Maybe there'll be a Facebook and a Google and an Apple.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.240]   Just as in the early days of messaging where these were silos, at some point people said,
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.320]   "But I want to talk to somebody on MCI Mail." Well, I wouldn't slack to my mind.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:48.240]   Slack would be the first best competitor because that's where I'm involved in communication that
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.440]   actually matters to me. They don't have the tech stack to do this though. That's the problem.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.240]   So that's really what Stacy and I are talking about here is what Apple's doing. And I think
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.840]   what Google's doing is they are building hardware for this metaverse down the road.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:11.520]   And that's why Facebook got Oculus. That was the plan, I'm sure, from the long-term plan for Mark.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:19.200]   It wasn't about lightsaber. Beatz was about- Mark Benioff has decided recently to hate Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.960]   Is he seeing himself in the competition in the future that a sales force slash business world
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.000]   is maybe a first- Everybody thought it was going to be entertainment. But after the pandemic
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.160]   and Zoom, what's 3D Zoom? What's a deeper Zoom? I don't know.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.200]   I don't know if this would ever be independent, considering just-
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.240]   It's too expensive for cost. Yeah, it's too expensive. At best, it'll be federated where you'll be able to
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.200]   kind of step out of the Facebook- Maybe somebody may be sitting across from you in the Apple
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.680]   universe and you're in the Facebook universe and you can talk to them.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.800]   And everybody's a green blob or whatever blob, yeah.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:04.640]   Yeah, maybe you'll get like Unicodeed down, right, to like a basic base in like the Apple universe
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:11.680]   if you're coming from Google. Look at the big players in tech right now, the people with deep pockets.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:20.480]   They're all aiming towards- Microsoft certainly is. I can't think of how Amazon is, but I'm sure
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.040]   that Bezos is thinking about this. Maybe not. Maybe he was distracted by sending-
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.040]   No, he's done. He's just-
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:27.040]   He's just-
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.880]   He's done. Yeah, maybe he's done. Yeah. He's already out to space, remember?
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.840]   By the way, the-
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.600]   Do you know what the metaverse needs? What?
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.040]   Servers. And plus, Amazon is still in the game.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.960]   Yeah, yeah. Right. You know, you're absolutely right. What am I thinking?
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.240]   Of course. Do you?
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.200]   Jeff's smart enough to go. I don't want to worry about the glasses.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.240]   I don't want to worry about social. I just want to be the-
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.600]   Who made the money in the gold rush, in the 1849 gold rush? It wasn't the gold miners. It was
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:06.880]   Levi's. Levi's. The guy has made the picks and the blue jeans. They just want to be the Levi's of the
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:13.040]   metaverse. So anyway, so a new name you think it's going to-
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.920]   So the presumption is that it tries to erase our current views, that it re-brands around the
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.600]   metaverse. I think it leads maybe to a different corporate structure.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.720]   Yeah, maybe. It's just going to be a punchline. Maybe it's more like alphabet.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.520]   Right. What Google did, which said, look, we got too many things, too many
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.840]   irons in the fire. Let's have a overall-
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.240]   Yeah, I can see Mark saying, I'm going to go do metaverse now.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:48.800]   And the folks in charge of Instagram and now Facebook, that's all your problem.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.360]   Well, that is not-
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.000]   So it's alphabet, not Altria.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.920]   Maybe. Which is the Philip Morris company.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.680]   Right. Maybe. I don't know. That's a good question. Maybe it's more alphabet than Altria.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:07.360]   That's good. I'm the wrong guy to ask, but if I had 32 billion dollars, you wouldn't see me
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.960]   coming in the office nine to five months. Go on.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.920]   Right. So I just wonder, at some point everybody hangs, I mean, everybody except Warren Buffett
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.520]   hangs up their hat and coat and gets to enjoy. That's what Jeff Bezos is pretty apparently doing.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:29.840]   I want to enjoy what few years they've got left with their riches, spend more time with their money.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.120]   Maybe that's what- I mean, Mark certainly got enough money. Maybe he's just saying,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.840]   yeah, this is getting hairy. And you know what? If he were really self-aware, he would also say,
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.360]   and maybe I'm not the best face of this, because he's not.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.760]   Maybe everyone hates me and I shouldn't be in front of this. This is really my baby.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.280]   Well, does he also see the opportunity to become Bill Gates, where well, they hated him, but they
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.880]   don't anymore. Right. Well, that's what always happens. That's what happened to Andrew Carnegie.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.040]   No, no, they're circling around to hating Bill Gates again.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.640]   Yeah, we are coming back to that, aren't we?
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.480]   Just letting you know we're not fans anymore. Isn't that funny how that happens?
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:14.880]   Yeah, actually Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos' arc seems to be similar.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.360]   You know, I don't know. See, I'm the wrong guy. See, I can't imagine
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:25.200]   being as wealthy as any of these guys are and really feeling like I had to come to work every day.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.440]   I agree with you, sir. Would you build a yacht and just go for sale?
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.360]   I would not build a yacht. Good Lord. That is so rude.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.200]   I would just go for a couch. That's what Bezos is doing.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.680]   I know. By the way, I highly recommend Brad Stone's newest Amazon on Bound, which is kind of the
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.120]   second half of his Amazon. I wonder if he's doing a trilogy, but it covers the more recent years.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.120]   And it really is kind of an insight into what was going on as we reported all these stories over
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:56.240]   the last three or four years. What's really going on? Blue Origin and all of Amazon's initiatives.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:04.320]   It's quite fascinating. But it does feel like at some point, maybe around 2017,
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.640]   Jeff Bezos decided to enjoy his money a little bit more.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:17.680]   As an example, Jeff Bezos hated helicopters. He would refuse to go on helicopters. He thought it was
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.400]   terrible idea environmentally. He thought it was dangerous. He was, of course, the king of frugality.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.080]   He would make his salespeople even when they're flying across the world to fly economy.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:31.680]   He hated helicopters. Then all of a sudden, in HQ2, as they do remember this search
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.920]   for the next headquarters for Amazon, where he got 300 cities to beg and plead,
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:44.000]   please, Jeff, open a headquarters here as part of the requirements, a helipad nearby
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.720]   within walking distance. And everybody's scratching their heads. And it turned out it's coming from
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.760]   the highest sources. This is a requirement, a helipad. Everybody's scratching their heads.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:00.880]   Then they find out a couple of months later that his girlfriend owns a helicopter company and is a
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:13.760]   pilot. Oh, oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Suddenly he loves helicopters. He's definitely human. He's a human.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.160]   He's a human. Right. Right. I didn't used to like cats. You know, it's,
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.320]   but love. I love them now. Are you playing video games? I love them.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.640]   Literally strange bedfellows, little furry things in the bed with. Yeah. I love cats. Yeah.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:38.560]   So what else should we touch? Jeff, what do you, what do you got? There's so many good stories.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.800]   There's lots of good stories. Well, you want a little light thing? Yeah, sure. Line 39.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:50.240]   Throwing a bean with eyes and a moose bush. A moose bush. Yes. Coding with eyes. Build a small
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:57.120]   demo for my hands free coding experience experiment. Right. Charly Jarrar managed to write a little
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.600]   react component with my eyes in less than 30 seconds. I did want to write h I not h y, but that's
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.960]   not the point. Thinking about how to build interfaces with limited input. Look left, right is super
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.040]   interesting. She's got a video, which is really cool. We'll start it over from the beginning.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.800]   Looking at her and the lower right, she's looking around. How wait a minute? Come on.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.680]   That's why I wanted to, I wanted you to check on this and see what you thought it was. That seems
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.880]   like you have a headache in about five minutes. But if you didn't have any other way of inputting,
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.240]   of course, well, with my, with my nearly deaf father, I'm getting much more respect for accessibility.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.880]   Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That's cool. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So on the right, there's a
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:45.760]   a pallet of words that she can look at and choose. On the left is there actually a JavaScript code,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.400]   and she's actually creating partly this you can do this because there's a lot of boiler plate
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.560]   in that coding, especially JavaScript and JavaScript makes it easier. Yeah. And then she did after
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:02.480]   all type h y not h i, but okay. Oh, you said she let me see what her job is. She must be an
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:10.000]   accessibility senior front end developer at Netlify Google dev expert and Mo's tech speakers.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.080]   Interesting. So she's just working on this on her own, I guess.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:18.640]   Neat. That's a feel good story. Thank you, Jeff. That's good. Yeah.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.760]   Here's one that made me feel terrible. Huh? Okay.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.080]   Did we tweet her during the show? Yes. I just want Jeff. Jeff's retweeting my real
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.720]   five seconds. I retweet. I'm doing research. This is how I find these things.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:37.520]   Jeff is tweeting. He's yeah, he's answering emails. He's probably writing the medium post right now.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:44.080]   We actually busted Jeff. He and I'm working on it's beautiful. You weren't here last week Stacy.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.800]   At the end of the show, I'm looking and Jeff's like tweeted 15 times during the show.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:55.920]   You knew this all along huh? Yeah. Well, every now and then I'll check Twitter.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.520]   Oh, okay. Yeah. Because I'm like dude, I mean like I could read Twitter like.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.320]   Oh, it's mostly retweeting. It's mostly pretty easy. Yeah. You just push a button.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:14.240]   I was in my book history wong. So there was a major scandal about an Oxford professor
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:22.480]   and I retweeted that hard. You know, ransomware has hit hospitals. It hit Sinclair television
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:29.760]   stations on Sunday. All the TV stations were shut down by ransomware. It is hit the infrastructure
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:39.600]   water sewage. But this is a step too far. Ransomware hits US candy maker ahead of Halloween.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.800]   Lisa's gonna be very upset. Oh, candy corn. Ferrara, which makes get ready. Sweet tarts,
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:53.600]   nerds, reds, hots, lemon heads, pixie sticks and everlasting gobstoppers has had to shut down
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.240]   production in some facilities. Oh, trying to fill orders before Halloween.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:08.720]   Lisa's a big sweet tarts fan. Yeah, like it's good. It's just sugar in. I don't I don't I
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.000]   honestly don't get it. But anyway, that's that's one of the few candies. I'll eat. I don't eat a
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.880]   lot of candy. Ferrara first noticed that hackers were encrypting its computers demanding payment on
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   October 9th. They hired outside experts to help restore its system. Disclose the attack as it
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:31.280]   has to now by law by on Tuesday. Three Midwestern grain distributors have been hacked.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:39.840]   Food a lot of food. Yeah, a lot of food lately. But man, keep your hands off my red hots.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:48.560]   This is ransomware though. It is it having a backup isn't always the answer though, right? Because
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.600]   what if the backup is infected, right? I'm no. Yeah, no, that's no. So this it's really interesting
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.040]   to watch and you listen to security now because we're talking a little bit about this on that show
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.200]   as you would imagine with Steve Gibson on Tuesdays. But what's happened is evolved over time. So
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:13.440]   the first generation, I will call it, of ransomware was pretty pitiful. They would encrypt your
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:19.200]   computer, but then they would put up a notice saying go down to 711 and buy some money packs.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.760]   And mail them cards. Yeah, because they had no anonymous way of getting the money with the
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.520]   ascendants of Bitcoin. That's when in my opinion, the second generation of ransomware really took
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.280]   off because suddenly they had a way and at first they had to say, and if you don't know what Bitcoin
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.240]   is and click this link and then here's how you buy Bitcoin. But as more and more people know
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.440]   that Bitcoin is really is facilitated ransomware because everybody knows about it. So that's that
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:54.720]   was the next big step. The third generation was ransomware as a service where talented hackers
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.440]   would create ransomware like so don't know key be, which is one of the big ransomware tools.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:07.680]   And then create, in this case, a ransomware service called Reevil. And then that meant that
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:15.200]   hundreds of little untalented hackers could go to you'd go to the websites, their special websites,
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.400]   and you'd say, yeah, I'm going to they had affiliates. And I'm going to affect this people. The affiliate
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:28.320]   would use the ransomware software pay a percentage to the Reevil gang. And so they were making money,
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.800]   but also a lot of people who didn't have the real skill set to do ransomware, making money.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.880]   Then another generation came along as people started realizing, yeah, good backup might be the
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.320]   solution. And what they did with inspired, I think, by the Sony hackers who did this was they
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.960]   would get into a system and they wouldn't trigger the ransomware immediately. In other words, that
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:53.360]   email that phishing mail wouldn't immediately encrypt everything. No, the first email was to
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.520]   get them into the system and they would wander around the system. And they were doing exactly
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.000]   what you're talking about, which is they would find out where your backups were. And they make
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.880]   sure that they set off the ransomware bomb everywhere, including your backups, right? If they could,
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.360]   even in your offsite stuff. The other thing they decided to do, and they did this with Sony, is
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:22.720]   X-filtrate before they triggered the bomb, X-filtrate information. And that's lately been the really
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.360]   deadly kind of ransomware. So they'll say to a company like Ferrara, that's not a good example.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:33.920]   Somebody, usually a public company, we have all this information. We have all your customers,
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:40.080]   passwords and bank account numbers. You're going to pay us Bitcoin, even if it's not to
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.200]   decrypt your data, to keep us from embarrassing you. And so that's been a little bit less.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.400]   Little blackmail.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.640]   But it's real blackmail. I mean, it's blackmail from day one. It's double blackmail now.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:58.160]   So yeah, it's been interesting to watch this evolve. And it's nasty. It's nasty. And then
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.360]   now they're starting to go after infrastructure. And that's of course why the US government has
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.400]   gotten very active in this. And they're actually looking at treaties and so forth to try to get
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.280]   put pressure on.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.640]   Well, in the tech industry is really pushing hard. Like you sell Sundar Pashai, just talk about it.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:21.440]   Brad Smith from Microsoft is pushing. I mean, like all the tech CEOs are like,
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.680]   you know what? This can't be all on us because they recognize the fact that
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.520]   they have a role to play. But so do the people actually deploying all these computers and
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:39.200]   infrastructure. Google can't do anything. Just throwing this out. Microsoft can't do anything
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.360]   if your water plant doesn't have the budget to upgrade to like the latest windows and
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.760]   create policies to prevent people from accessing team viewer, right?
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.520]   Right. So some of these things, we're just going to have to have some sort of federal
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.680]   like mandates. We're going to have to funding to get these companies that historically haven't
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.600]   been targets or don't have the budget for it and the expertise because we can't mint that
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.960]   many cybersecurity experts. We just it's not feasible.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.720]   No. So as with all securities, you got to do attack in every area, multi-layered defense.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.360]   So you're also going after the payment systems, you know, getting the Bitcoin exchanges
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.080]   taken down. You're going after the servers. You're going after every aspect, getting
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:32.000]   if you can get Putin and Xi to do something that might help. They don't seem to be all that
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:39.040]   interested. But you get other countries involved. Yes, you teach water control. You give them the
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:45.200]   resources, the money and the instruction to keep them from leaving team viewer open
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:53.040]   on their system. Yeah, you got to do it all. And fortunately, I think both the government
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.760]   industry are taking it seriously because it's bad. I mean, it's really, really, really bad.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:07.120]   Really bad. The podcast business is booming, right, Sarah Fisher on Axios, but few are making money.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:18.000]   Good. Get out of the business. Leave me alone. Only a few big players make meaningful revenue
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.080]   from podcast today. I am a small player and I make meaningful revenue.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:29.040]   You know, this is another clueless article. I always find meaningful.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.120]   Yeah, you didn't ask me.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:39.600]   Downloads per episode. This cracks me up. Apparently, if you get 35,000 downloads,
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.800]   you're in the top 1%. I'm in the top 2%. Yeah, boys and girls, we are in the top 1% easily.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:58.160]   We don't actually try to sell podcasts. We used to make it if you don't have more than 50,000 listeners
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.080]   and we've gotten a little more. I think we're now, in fact, I think congratulations. You just
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.640]   crossed the threshold with hands-on photography so that we can start to sell your podcast.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.440]   So the reason we don't even bother if it's below a certain number is because advertisers don't,
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.040]   they don't care. And even if they did, because you charge per thousand listeners,
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:22.560]   I know it's a hardly worth the effort if we're going to make 200 bucks, right? It's not exactly.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.000]   It's not going to work. So this, I don't know where she got her information.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.360]   I bet she says in that article.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:37.520]   Yeah, it's from, you know, price, water, house, Cooper, global entertainment and media outlook.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:43.680]   Projected podcast revenue in 2024 will be 1.7 billion.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.680]   Newspaper magazine is going down. Yeah.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:53.520]   Minus, according to time to pivot again, 27% down according to price, water,
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:57.360]   house, Cooper. But, you know, I always, I don't know where they get the numbers out of these
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.160]   projections and so forth. I don't know. I don't. Yeah.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:06.000]   Well, in getting a media, I mean, like, I remember trying to convince fortune to,
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.800]   like, monetize my podcast and they were just like, it's such a non-... I was like,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.720]   it would literally pay my salary and then some and they were like,
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:25.120]   I was like, okay. Now the New York Times podcast division reportedly brought in 30 million in
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.560]   revenue in 2019. I believe that the daily was very, very, has been very, very successful in the
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.080]   area. It was with the spending. They're spending a lot. Right. Vox, it says, is in the eight figures,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.720]   which is somewhere between 10 and 90 million, I guess. Spotify paid Joe Rogan 100 million
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:50.240]   to sign an exclusive deal. I think Spotify, it's pretty clear, is deficit spending. They're not
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.160]   expecting to make that money back. They're overpaying. They're overpaying and they're investing
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:00.320]   because there's other ways they can make money. So anyway, I'm just glad to know that most people
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.680]   are not making money. Get out of the business. You're just making it hard for the rest of us.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:11.280]   No kidding. It's actually, I've said this from day one is you, if you want to do a podcast too,
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.720]   don't expect to become rich doing it. Do it because you want to.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.320]   Because you're excited about it and passionate about it. And then if you're,
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.160]   you know, really are knowledgeable and passionate like Stacey and Kevin are,
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.800]   you'll make it, you'll make money on it. You make a decent, you know, you can also look at it as a
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:35.280]   talent. What is the word funnel? Yes. For you. Like I mean, find people who are good tech
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:41.840]   podcasters and hire them if you need. Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, I tell Henry this all the
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.800]   time. He's, by the way, any minute now, he's going to hit a million followers on. Did he hit a million?
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.880]   Yeah, sorry to be a big star. Put it in the rundown. Oh, congratulations.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.840]   One day. Yes. Congratulations. So, but he's not making any money on it. And I tell him,
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.680]   don't worry about making money on it yet. Build your audience. You got a rich dad.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.200]   Yeah. Build the brand. Yeah. Not everybody has a rich dad.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.240]   No, no. I don't advocate this for all creators.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.400]   But at the same time, I don't think it's a good idea to go into
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:19.520]   podcasting, hoping to make a living at it. That's going to really hobble you, right?
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:26.080]   Have a day. Have a journalist, a galore who say, I'm going to start my independent journalism thing.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.200]   And I always tell them, form follows substance. Don't tell me you're going to make a podcast.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.320]   Tell me what you're doing first. Tell me your value first. Tell me who you're serving and
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:38.080]   what they need first. Then if you say, I'm going to do a podcast as a form, fine. But yeah,
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.360]   they're whether it's a blog or a podcast or an email newsletter, they're trying to make a living
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:49.040]   out of it. Yeah, but you may not. I wouldn't recommend quitting your day job. If your day job
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.520]   quits you, then go ahead. Yeah, different story. But you're smart, Stacey, and you had to
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:59.440]   vara, you knew what you were getting into, right? Or did you? Was it just changed? I did. Well,
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:06.160]   no, no, I mean, I had a, let me put it this way. I had two years of savings, so I could lose money
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.800]   for two years. Yeah, that's exactly how you do it. I mean, yeah. You didn't have to go through
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.240]   two years of savings, though, about before you. No, no, I was, I actually recouped my salary from
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:24.240]   Fortune this first year that I was doing it. Yeah. Now, I'm not going to, I mean, I'm not going to
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:32.720]   make a million dollars. I mean, my revenue from my podcast is it's roughly, it's a little over a
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:39.200]   quarter million. So, I mean, but that's, it's just me and, you know, I pay Kevin. That's great. I know,
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:45.360]   that's fantastic. That's something to be really proud of. That's freaking awesome.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.680]   Yeah. Again, it's non-venture capital worthy, but it is totally viable.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:55.280]   Best of all. Well, and that's the last thing anybody should say is, well, you know, my plan is
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.400]   to, I'm going to give a big exit with Google or my IPO. You should, even if you're a startup, I mean,
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.520]   I would, it's sad that a lot of startups do start with that in mind. And that's not building value.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.080]   That's, well, I mean, it depends on what you're after. If you're going to build like a whole new
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:16.560]   chip to take on AI, you're going to do venture money. Yeah. Yeah. But to start, I mean, a podcast
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:23.840]   is not expensive to operate. And, you know, my learning was taken at everybody else's dime because
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.920]   I worked for publications. And by the way, despite his loaded dad salt tank,
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:37.120]   saves a lot of money, continues to work other jobs. He's not, he's not just sitting there, you know,
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:44.640]   having fun at my expense. So, but he's actually working at that. Oh, he's working really hard.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.440]   Brand. I mean, you can see he puts work into his. Oh, God, yeah. This is not. And he also does
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:25:00.320]   not live at his mom's house anymore. So you can stop that. Stacy Stacy, you work really hard,
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.120]   right? I mean, when it's your own business, you work really hard. Yes and no. I mean,
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.200]   I did this business because I couldn't handle working 60 hours a week.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:15.920]   Were you working that hard for people? Oh, wow. Oh, God, for oh my sword, I got 60 to 80 hours.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.960]   And sometimes oh, he's a lovely man, but sometimes he can be kind of a jerk to work for.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:29.680]   Like, was he demanding? No, he just, he asks a lot of himself. Yeah. And he has high standards.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:36.080]   People. Yeah. Yeah. And he has a really hard attacks. He does not have children.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:43.200]   So there was an incident where he called me when I was in the ER with my daughter. Oh, my God.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.400]   I'm at a wedding. So I can't do this story. Can you do it? And I was like, no, no, no. My
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:54.880]   daughter's fine. And I'm at the ER. But he's like, Oh, right. Jesus. Wow. But you would have to be
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:00.560]   pretty confident and strong to say that to your boss to be like, buddy, good for you. But yeah.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.640]   Yeah. So, so, but those are the kind of things that I just, I didn't want to deal with anymore.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:13.760]   And you want to be your boss. But I don't, I don't work as hard as I used to. Neither do I.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:23.440]   Neither do I. But in the early days of this, and I wasn't trying to build a podcast business at all.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.160]   But in the early days, you know, the first few years of
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.280]   Twitter, I was editing everything and doing everything. I was pan creating RSS.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:37.360]   Out of a tiny little, yeah, little carrot, little attics, attics studio. So yeah. And that was hard
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.920]   work. But it was very gratifying. I would, I would argue maybe even more gratifying
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.440]   when I had to do it all by myself. Because at the end of the day,
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.520]   Kevin and I did the, oh, yeah, go on. At the end of the day, you could look and say,
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.640]   I made that I did that. No. Yeah. Kevin and I used to do it for the whole year.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:01.360]   The podcast for free is like, and I did it after hours at Fortune and he did it after hours while
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.520]   at Google. Yeah, that's the way you start. That's exactly I start. And now your dog demands you.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:18.560]   Now I have to say, I am now I'm not going to play this WNYC studios thing to social media.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.600]   So it's I put it there, obviously, it turns nice people into trolls. But I did read the article and
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:31.040]   I kind of agree. And I was going to bookmark this as well. So I'm glad you I presume you put this
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:38.560]   in. Yes, I did. You could guess. But no, I also was going to put it in myself. So research by Michael
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:44.160]   Bang Peterson, great middle name, Michael Bang Peterson. He's Danish. Yeah, my
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.200]   name is Dr. Bong Peterson. He better is Professor of Political Science at our
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:54.720]   Husi University in Denmark. He is conducted research as part of the research on online
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:02.000]   political hostility project. According to Peterson, social media is a powerful tool
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.680]   in the hands. Yes, of people prone toward political violence misinformation in the hands
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:15.360]   of people prone towards political violence. However, misinformation shared online does not make people
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:22.880]   hostile. Any more than let's say a violent video game makes people violent. Right. So lies on
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.520]   social media. This I thought was really interesting. Serve to connect people who are already prone to
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.920]   political violence. In other words, you don't go into social media and get radicalized.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:38.480]   Hot dotty dotty dot. I'm a normal person. I'm just fine. I'm crazy. Right. You go in there crazy
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:43.680]   and social media, then you find all the people and you get crazy too. What can we do together?
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:50.240]   I feel like you might be predisposed. Like, I could listen to some crazy people. Now I'm
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.000]   going to listen to them a little bit longer. And then you become like, I don't know if you're
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.200]   becoming radicalized or if you've already been, you know, well, I've certainly seen people go down
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:07.200]   that rabbit hole. But all of this is anecdotal. I mean, this is a this is a study. So it's easy
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.360]   to anecdotally say, yeah, I could think of a couple of people who seemed horrible.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:19.120]   My favorite part of of his argument was that he said, real life is the echo chamber. Yeah,
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.000]   our lives every day is the we do that we like people with the time we seek out like,
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.680]   what the internet does is puncture the echo chamber and expose us to people we don't like.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:33.840]   What you've always said, Jeff, it does serendipity of the internet. And that's why you want to
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:39.600]   preserve that filter. Well, Jeff's always said, argued against there being a filter bubble.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:46.080]   Yes, yes. And so does Axel Brun's in the book in the book, our filter bubbles real,
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.440]   his answer after much research is no. And what what what Peterson is trying to say,
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:59.840]   he's saying that these tools can be used for bad. He's not saying that. But the presumption of
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:04.640]   the process is off and thus the interventions are going to be off. And that's that's part of
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:09.120]   the point to. So he's saying people come into this predispose that's point one, but point two is
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:16.480]   it's about the this exposure to people and something something shakes his life like, I don't like
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:20.640]   those people who get vaccines. Wow, there's a lot of them, right? And I can see them now,
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:26.160]   whereas maybe every day I go to the bar and I go to my work, I don't see him. And so I'm kind
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:31.280]   of happier and I'm less angry. And then I find that the objects of my anger are present. If I'm
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:40.800]   an angry guy, which I'm not I do think, though, you would agree that by the way, another interesting
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:46.000]   piece in this was that Twitter is the least likely place to radicalize people. And I think that's
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.640]   where you get that serendipity that flow of other opinions that helps immunize people against,
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:56.320]   you know, the filter, whatever, you can create your own filter bubble, you would admit to that,
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:05.440]   right? I do also think, though, that when you had to write a unibomber manifesto, it was a lot of work
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:13.840]   that that meant that a lot of people were thinking that didn't do it. But now it's so easy to write
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:21.440]   a 280 character manifesto and fire, you know, salvos that I think there is a lot more of that
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.640]   just because it's so easy. Would you agree to that? Right? Yeah, I would. I would,
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:32.080]   absolutely. And so but the intervention to that, to me, is what's interesting because now we're
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:36.800]   in a mode of playing whack-a-mole with bad and crazy stuff. And we're never going to win at that.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:40.240]   We are never, never, never going to win at that. There's always going to be crazies out there
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:46.400]   and wackies and hateful people. And what we and so I did an interview with a Argentine editor today
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.720]   and he made me think about it. I thought there are two skills we've got to learn on the net, right?
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:56.880]   One which I've said before is to ignore more crazy stuff, is to give it less attention because
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.440]   the goal of the crazy is so often to get attention and the more crazy, the more attention, and that's
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:06.080]   not fitting into your algorithm argument is that if it's based on engagement and engagement
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:13.760]   does that form a lot of a lot of blah. Though, Fijicimo said in an interview who's now left
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:18.800]   Facebook and is now an Instacart, and she said that Facebook is a mirror of society, and she said
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.600]   that when people say, "Well, get rid of the bad stuff, get rid of the engagement," she said,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:29.840]   "that's nuanced because it might be you're engaged in a protest movement." And maybe you do dislike
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:34.960]   people and you're there because of that. And so if you get rid of all engagement of that sort,
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.560]   you can be getting rid of things in political movements that matter. But nonetheless, we've
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:45.360]   got to learn to ignore idiocy better and we've got to learn to say less idiotic stuff. But we've
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   got to recognize there's just going to be a whole mess of stuff out there. And that's why I think
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.560]   that the next generation of the net has to be about selection and curation and finding that
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:01.200]   which is worth listening to. And this is where I go back to my hopes for Jack's blue sky is that
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:06.080]   the speaking is a commodified layer that now everybody can do that's no longer a big deal. But
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.280]   you wasn't a big deal before. You couldn't get in the New York Times, then you can blog,
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.360]   then you can tweet, then you can Facebook. Everybody who's connected, which is a limited number,
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:20.000]   but still a huge number can speak now. So that's no longer the big deal. Now the big deal is what
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.840]   the hell's worth listening to? So this is perfect because actually, do you know, are you familiar
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:34.080]   with Ed Zetron? Easy PR dude? He has a newsletter that's pretty good. And his newsletter for today
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:39.440]   was actually we need to educate people about how the internet works. So we are doing all this crazy
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.600]   stuff at scale. And we never tell people how things work, how to choose what they see,
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:50.960]   how to like curate things. So they end up finding like dopamine hits. So basically,
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.880]   we've never told people not to do drugs on the internet, right? In the sense that
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:00.480]   don't go for those quick dopamine hits. And if I think back to it, that's a lot of what I tell
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:06.400]   my daughter about, you know, engaging, I'm like, think about this, you will never unsee something
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:13.600]   that you see on the internet. So really check before you, you know, and again, don't engage with.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:21.520]   So basically it's kind of like, I mean, it's kind of like the social mores that we aren't picking up
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:27.600]   yet. So I thought his article was pretty good. Do you think telling people it's a Skinner box
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.800]   kind of inoculates them against the Skinner box? I don't know if it will inoculate everybody.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:43.680]   So I do think it helps. I think it helps people, you know, again, if you don't know the rules,
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:50.000]   knowing some of the rules will help. Sometimes enough just to give somebody like that much
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   distance and they go, Oh, yeah, you're right. I see what's happening. And they can pull back.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.800]   If they don't know that they keep hitting that lever to get the pill, they don't know they're
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.720]   doing that they might not be aware, but just a little awareness sometimes is enough. But the
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.320]   problem is not with everybody. Some people go, yeah, but I'm still going to hit it.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:12.240]   Same with a drunk in the bar. Yeah. You don't go.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.640]   You're still going to have the same.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.440]   I think about doom scrolling. We like before people like started talking about doom scrolling.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:26.640]   I mean, was I doing it? Yes. But once I had a name for it and could identify the behavior,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.520]   I was like, Oh, shoot. Yes. Right. Right.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.600]   Right. I think there's value in that.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:35.840]   Yes. That gives you the other thing is to see what you're doing and go home and stop that.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:40.240]   Yeah. We need new institutions. And part of me, we need, we need actually did a graphic for this.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:50.000]   Gutenberg moment. The very first call for censorship of the press was in Italy about 20,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.200]   25 years after Gutenberg, where somebody pissed off about a bad translation of Pliny,
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.520]   wrote to the Pope and said, you've got to edit this stuff. You've got to change this stuff.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.160]   You've got to censor it. You've got to control what comes out. You've got to point people to do
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.240]   this. And I realized he wasn't really asking for censorship. He was asking for editors and
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:14.160]   publishers. He was asking for the institutions that eventually were created to filter and find
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.320]   quality. Now, you don't want to go back to that gatekeeper. I do not want to go back to that.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.040]   What I'm saying is those institutions are now insufficient for a world of complete abundance.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.960]   Right. We need to figure out and invent new institutions and an eight Facebook and an eight
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:33.840]   Instagram, right? And an eight Congress. And so smart people. I hope that my students,
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.800]   I want to teach a course. I think I mentioned this last time with Doug Rushkoff
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:44.880]   designing the internet. I wish I could sit in on that one and trying to get students to see that
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:49.360]   they do have agency and power to decide what the internet ought to be. And they can design
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.840]   an ethical regime, a regulatory regime, and you got to record those lectures.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.240]   I think it would be a war discussion. I wish you would record those.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:04.160]   I think the great thing, by the way, is Doug, I mean, Doug wrote, I wrote,
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.680]   what would Google do? And Doug wrote throwing rocks at a Google bus.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:14.960]   And Doug said, I love Doug and Doug loves me. And he said the other day, I don't know if I said
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.800]   this in the show the other day, he said, you know, Jeff, he said, we end up at the same place,
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.400]   which is we still believe we can make a better internet. We just get there differently. He said,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.920]   I want less evil. You want more good. That's fair. And I think it's fair. I think it's right. I
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.000]   think it's just a different view. But the goal is to see if everybody's nothing. I've had the same
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.040]   discussion with him and we're kind of the same way. And so if we have that discussion that Stacy
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.360]   wants, if we have the ability to stand back and look at what we're doing, if we have the separation
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:46.400]   you just mentioned, and then say, okay, then what does it we do? We're going to connect with each
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:51.840]   other online. We can't turn that off. But how can we do it better? What's our purpose for doing it?
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.720]   The point of that study, and I think in general, is you can do all that and there's still going to
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.800]   be crazy people because they always have been crazy people. And they're still going to find
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.680]   each other and they're still going to be online. And there's really nothing you can do about that.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:11.600]   That's you can't get rid of crazy. I wish we could. I wish there were a pill. We could put it in the
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.680]   water. Crazy people would stop being crazy. People make, you know, amazing things. No, we need the
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:25.040]   diversity. I agree. He'd Kafka. And who decides who's crazy? That's right. Exactly. So let a
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.760]   million flowers bloom, I guess. Yeah. But just ignore some of the flowers. Right. Don't go on some of
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.320]   our weeds. But that's, you know, this is. Some of them are exploding cactuses.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:41.280]   Just get as far away as you can before they explore some of the Morvita's fly traps. This is the
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.680]   the study I was referring to. It's not a very good one. It's from sapienjournal.org.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:54.160]   There was only 17 people, mostly European. So it's worthless. But it's interesting because
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:00.960]   the they asked people some statements and the there was a very strong correlation.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.920]   People who believed in one conspiracy theory were more likely to believe in others.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:11.280]   While engagement with Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp and Messenger will all associated with an
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.840]   increase in expressed conspiracy beliefs. Engagement with Twitter was associated with the reduction
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:23.120]   in expressed conspiracy beliefs. And if I think about it, that's the difference between a strong
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:32.000]   recommendation engine moving you in that direction and a much more serendipitous salad of beliefs
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.800]   that maybe you know, Leo was thinking about your algorithm complaints or moral panic because
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:42.320]   maybe just today with Twitter, because there were some tweets that I saw that I said,
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.560]   oh, somebody I really care about a couple of people I really cared about and things I care about
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:53.920]   and they popped up on my feed and they were 17 hours ago. And an algorithm is now that's not
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.160]   as supportive. That's that's love Twitter supported. Right. So it's a little bit different.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:05.760]   But I think it is possible to recommend it is possible to bring things out. But on what basis
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.160]   are we doing it with what metrics with what gauges of success that matter is breaking.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:15.280]   No, I think this is this is an old conversation about the internet about curation. I think we've
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:21.760]   always recognized that there's such a volume of content. It's there's without some help.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.240]   It's very impossible. It's almost impossible to, you know, find what you want to enjoy your
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:32.880]   experience. So curation of some kind. But I think that algorithms that are tuned toward maximizing
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:40.720]   engagement alone, unfortunately, always seem to move in the direction of extremism. And so
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:46.000]   that's the problem. And so yeah, I'm not against curation at all. What do we do here? This is all
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.600]   about immigration. So I'm not against that at all. People do need some guidance in this massive
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.640]   information we're suddenly exposed to. I just don't want it to be automated algorithms tuned
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.760]   to maximizing engagement for purposes of profit. That seems to be a bad idea.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:06.240]   Ben Evans, who you know, I'm a big fan of the analyst in his newsletter this week,
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:11.920]   a piece called Stepping Out of the Firehose. He talks about how people have hundreds of thousands
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.720]   of emails. We have this abundance. And he thought back, I love this analogy, he thought back to the
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:23.360]   machine age and out of the machine age came the arts and crafts movement, which was not an effort.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.520]   I don't think reaction to the machine. Kill the machine, but it was saying, well, what do we
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.360]   also value? What do we also do? It was humanizing it. Right. And so what are
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:38.320]   other reactions to the net that can can use the power saw, but it's still made by hands and make
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:44.160]   us something neat. That's what's that's what's possible. I'm not against humanizing the net
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.960]   in all of our flaws. Well, there's some jerky humans. You don't want to be. But that's fine. You
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:54.800]   know, I mean, that's why I don't have a problem with OAN or people want to listen to Steve Bannon's
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.720]   podcast. I have a problem with AT&T supporting and paying for OAN. It's not clear, by the way,
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.120]   that that's what happened. But whether it did or didn't, I have a problem with my cable company
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:10.160]   right now. But that's their right, right? It's a business. So we're not going to be so
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:17.280]   can't stop that. But you can still, you know, right? I can just good times news, you know.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:25.040]   What would Google let me take a break because I am so unless you want a three hour show, I better
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:31.840]   do some ads here. We ain't going to get to be a million dollar podcast without it.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:38.000]   Oh, the conversations are this short. Great. I have to say. I love that. Thank you. Thank you
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.640]   for doing that story. And I also love the next sponsor. You know, Stripe? I know he does. Stripe's
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.200]   doing interesting things. Stripe also has a publishing arm run by my friend, Kate Lee.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.160]   Yeah. We're doing fast and anything as you wouldn't have expected of such a company.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.000]   But I'm getting ahead of you. Go ahead, Lee. Stripe. I mean, it's at his root. It's a payments platform.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.760]   But it's a great payments platform. We all know Stripe because we've all encountered it. In fact,
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:07.840]   if you're a member of Club Twit, that's what we use for Club Twit's payment system. We love Stripe
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:13.600]   for the same reason that so many businesses love Stripe. First of all, it never goes down.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:23.280]   99.999% API uptime, 250 million plus API requests a day. It's super reliable. And that's, of course,
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.840]   that's kind of, you know, that's table stakes. You got to be reliable. But Stripe is also a great
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:35.600]   experience, both for the people who set it up and the customers who use it. That's why Shopify uses
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:42.640]   Stripe. That's why Lyft uses Stripe Kickstarter uses Stripe. These are businesses that are growing,
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:49.040]   that are ambitious. Stripe has helped them grow revenue and expand a new market quickly.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:56.560]   We use Stripe thanks to Memberful, which is our subscription service. And one of the reasons we like
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:04.400]   it is because of the high conversion rate, the ease of use, it's easy to, you know, do refunds.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:14.000]   If people ask for refunds, it's just a really nice way. They take more than 135 plus currencies
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.600]   and payment types. It's really a remarkable platform. It's easy to use once you once
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.720]   integrated their single platform and world-class docs allow businesses to easily experiment,
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.760]   to scale and grow revenue. They do billions of dollars every year for every size of business.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.840]   Hundreds of features and improvements added every year to help you stay ahead of the
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:37.920]   industry shifts. When you partner with Stripe, you can, and this was our experience exactly,
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:43.040]   free up your team to focus on other areas of your business. Our payments platform does not occupy
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:49.360]   any cycles. It just works. It works for our users. It works for us because Stripe is engineered
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:54.320]   with the world's most powerful and easy to use APIs. So it's so easy to get up and running in
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:01.200]   minutes, not days. Those of you looking for a no-code solution, this is so cool. They just
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:07.280]   launched payment links. This allows you to sell online by just generating a link. You can text or
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:13.840]   share with your customers to get paid fast. No coding required, very simple. There's another
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:20.720]   thing I love. They've invested in our earth with Stripe Climate. As a Stripe user, you can direct a
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:26.960]   fraction of your revenue to help scale emerging carbon removal technologies in just a few clicks.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.200]   So I think this is such a great thing. I don't know if we're doing this. If we're not, we're gonna.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.960]   I love that idea. Stripe is leveling the global playing field for people looking to start new
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:43.040]   businesses or expand existing businesses, whether you're pre-seed startup or a Fortune 500 company.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:51.680]   Everybody uses Stripe. It's just the best way to do payments. So whether you're an online or in-person
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:57.520]   retailer, whether you're a software platformer, a marketplace, or like us, a subscriptions business,
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.840]   go to Stripe.com to learn more about how Stripe could support your business today.
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:08.400]   Stripe.com, really the innovators, the leaders in this area. Learn more and get started today.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:15.280]   Stripe.com. I can't tell you how happy we are to use Stripe. I think you've all had a great
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:26.160]   experience. I know you have. Thank you, Stripe.com. Let's do some fun stuff. I think I didn't talk
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.920]   about on this show yet. Weimo, Google's self-driving vehicles, seem to have a problem
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:40.800]   just one street in the Richmond District of San Francisco. It's a dead-end street. And for some
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.920]   reason, Weimo vehicles seem to want to head down that street and then do a big U-turn.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:55.280]   This is channel 5's report upon this. I want to show, because there's some video,
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.600]   and I won't turn on the audio. They interview one of the people who lives in this dead-end.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.600]   Jennifer King, she said, "I noticed it when I was sleeping. I woke to a strange hum.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.480]   I thought there was a spacecraft outside my bedroom window. No, it was this." That's how
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:18.960]   San Francisco was. It was a Weimo vehicle making a U-E. And apparently, for some reason,
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.080]   like, I don't know, fish, they're attracted to this dead-end street. They all go down it
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:29.680]   and make a U-turn. There's some days there can be up to 50. Literally every five minutes.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.040]   We're all working from home, so this is what we hear. As channel 5 was there,
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:40.480]   recording, it was easy for them to catch a bunch of Weimos making this U-E.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.200]   Now, there's a safety driver, but the safety driver doesn't get involved.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:51.840]   The Weimos just taking the best route. And that's exactly what Weimos says.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:48:00.960]   We continually adjust to dynamic San Francisco road rules, which, as anybody who's driven that
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:08.240]   time for Cisco, knows. Yeah, they're dynamic. All right. In this case, cars traveling north of
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:16.080]   California Street on 15th Avenue have to take a U-turn due to the presence of slow street signage
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.560]   on Lake Street. So the Weimos driver is basically obeying the road rules. But see, this is the thing.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:28.880]   You and me, when we drive down that street, we go, "Just keep on going. I don't make a U-turn.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.520]   I'm not going to stop making U-turn go the other way." No, slow streets. I got it. I'll slow down.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.000]   But the Weimos takes it seriously, a commercial vehicle, I guess. And so they can't go on the
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.840]   street. So they get there and they turn around by the dozen. This is so fascinating from a,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.960]   "Hey, how a robotic driving or delivery or any other automation kind of thing changed the value of the
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.600]   real estate of your home, your business." Oh, yeah. You know. We kind of talked about that with the
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.040]   Starbucks, or not the Starbucks. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago with drone deliveries.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:08.400]   Oh, yeah. Well, you sure? This has to affect these houses on the Richmond District Street.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.880]   Yeah. I mean, like, if you're in life-- You have to disclose it.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:18.240]   Well, there's one little problem. How do you feel about electric vehicles?
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.440]   You can always catch a cab here. Yeah. There you go. It's just a bad spin.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.600]   That's hysterical. So they're seeing the sign that says, "Slow Street."
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:36.960]   And because the point of those signs is the city put those up to limit commercial traffic
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.280]   through residential districts. So I guess the Weimos says, "I'm commercial. I see that sign.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:48.320]   Got to turn around." And as I said, anybody else just going to say, "UPS driver goes,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.600]   screw that. I got a delivery to do." Well, you got to keep rolling.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:58.720]   Yeah. Hey, praise to Google for this. Bloomberg is calling this a moonshot.
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:08.400]   They want to be the first giant company run without emissions around the clock. And their goal is to
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:16.240]   do this-- I think-- No offsets. No buying carbon being zero carbon. Literally using zero carbon.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.200]   And they want to do this. What do they want to do this? It's committed to go free of carbon
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:30.480]   without using offsets, relying only on clean energy purchased near its locations 24 hours a day.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:37.040]   I don't see the year, but I think they want to do this faster than anybody else. I mean,
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.960]   Apple said we want to do that by 2030 Amazon by 2040. But a lot of that is buying carbon
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:50.160]   offsets to be carbon neutral. So good on you. I think they've been a leader in this.
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.640]   And I'm glad it's not merely carbon offsets, but they're really going to attempt to get
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.720]   renewable energy for all of them. They've got to figure out the battery situation and how to do
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:04.320]   that. Yeah. And I talked about this in the show. Our friend Bill Gross, his company EnergyVault.com.
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.240]   No. We know Bill, of course. And he's a-- Bill's wonderful. Bill's a great customer.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:12.240]   Yeah. Great customer. We got to get them on the show, by the way. EnergyVault.com.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:20.320]   Which he says-- Bill says that every place where you can store energy through water,
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.880]   setting it up to the reservoir and getting it back down is pretty much taken.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.280]   So EnergyVault moves blocks of cement and--
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.240]   Roar. I have seen it. And down. Yes.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.360]   So this is the kind of thing that Google's going to have to--
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.960]   So here's the problem. This is the problem. The sun is out just pouring energy onto the surface
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:45.440]   of the Earth. But the problem is at night or in the clouds, it's not putting any in there. So how do
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.280]   you somehow have to find a way to store that energy? So what they do is during the day when
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:58.720]   the sun is shining, they do heavy things. And at night, they can undo heavy things.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:03.440]   Oh, okay. Got you. Yeah. So you do the same thing with hydro sometimes. You'll pump water
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:05.920]   uphill and then you run it down. It's precisely that that was the inspiration.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.200]   Yeah. Yeah. So what are they doing? They're moving big blocks.
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.920]   Yeah. Which lets you kind of take waste material too and turn that into the blocks.
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:20.480]   Oh, they don't put it down. They're heavy. It's like a clock. They wind it up in the daytime
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.080]   and then they let it run down at night and generate-- Exactly.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:28.880]   Clever. So that's a different way to store energy that doesn't use batteries and chemicals
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.600]   and everything else that uses blocks. It's just like a clock. Right? Yeah.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:40.000]   Every morning I get up. My cuckoo clock. The little pinecone wait right to the floor. I pull it,
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.560]   and put energy into it, and then the rest of the day when I'm not around it slowly going back down.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.680]   Well, they raised 1.6 billion in a spactiil. Wow.
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:57.600]   Yeah. Here they are doing a slewing test. What's a slewing? I don't know.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.160]   The only problem is, I got to say, I don't want to live next door to this disgusting, ugly crane.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.920]   [laughter]
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.240]   I was suggesting to build that he should do this inside unused skyscrapers. We don't need any
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.520]   more because of offices. Yeah, there you go. There it is. There's this brick. So it lowers the
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:20.160]   brick to generate electricity. It does this autonomously, by the way. There's nobody sitting in the
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:29.200]   cab there pressing bones. No, no. Yeah. That's a kind of entrepreneurial thinking I love.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.880]   Yeah. Yeah. Moving concrete.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.080]   But anyway, so Google's going to have to work on those kinds of technologies,
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:43.920]   as well as the gathering of energy. The story and transmission of energy is going to matter.
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:48.320]   It always bugs me. There was another article saying the only way it was sustainable future is
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:52.960]   nuclear. It always bugs because there's so much energy pouring onto the surface of the earth from
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:54:00.720]   the sun. It seems to me that that seems like something we should be taking advantage of.
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:06.560]   It's too logical, sir. It's there for the take and we just have to figure out how to store it.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:11.040]   That's really the biggest problem and get better at more efficient at collecting it.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:16.400]   I've got almost 100 solar panels on my roof now. Geez. Nice.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:21.280]   I would have more, but PG&E does not want us to go into competition with them. Our local power
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:27.200]   company, literally, the truth is their money making business building power plants.
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:32.560]   So they don't want homeowners to be generating more electricity than they need
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.760]   pumping electricity in the grid because that makes their power plants.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.560]   Well, how do they stop you? How do they want to let you buy it?
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.760]   Yeah. I guess if I were off the grid, I could do whatever I want.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.040]   They implement rules like they charge you to sell your energy.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.200]   Yeah. But Arizona started doing this to people.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.360]   It's so annoying. Geez.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.480]   Because if everybody in California decided, "Yeah, let's put a solar..."
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:59.440]   This won't happen, but if they did, we could put PG&E out of business. That's what they're afraid of,
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:05.200]   by the way. And I have big batteries in the house because it's the same issue, right?
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:11.120]   So we have big Tesla power walls, which as I remember, recycled Tesla car batteries.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.880]   They charge up during the day and they discharge during the night.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:23.040]   Now, if we could find out how to do cold fusion, then we're then we're golden.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:26.880]   Oh my gosh. The New Yorker did a whole story on this.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.920]   I was like, "Oh, it must be time for the every once a decade,
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.760]   for the confusion story." Yeah. They could put that right next to the quantum computer story.
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.560]   Quantum computing. We've had movement in quantum computing.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.240]   And paperless offices. And that's true. We've had zero movement in fusion.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.000]   That's not true. Cold fusion. We have had new materials.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.840]   I just read the once a decade, one full fusion article in New York.
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:55.040]   We have had graphene, baby. No, we've had new materials science come out that helps us build
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:01.840]   more efficient magnets for those. Remember, you got to have a superheated magnetic bottle to
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:07.360]   the plasma. Anyway. I'm all for cold fusion, man. When they come up with that.
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:10.240]   Everyone is. Yeah, sure. You know what? It sounds like a really good drink.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.440]   Ice cold fusion. I'll take a wah. I'll take a wah. I'll take a wah. I'll take it right here.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:23.200]   There are actually 25 cold fusion startups right now that just have gotten the signal.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.640]   See? There you go. So maybe it's not. Maybe it's not. Sorry. I just I had to say it. Maybe it is time.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:35.040]   No, no. Keep us up to date on those things. A couple Amazon stories. Sure. You're looking?
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.320]   Amazon is Starbucks. Going to launch a co-branded lounge that combines the ghost
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.080]   stores with a cafe. There are some great anecdotes about the Amazon ghost stores, by the way.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.720]   Really? In Brad's book. Oh, yeah. It's really funny. They had a lot of problems.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:57.840]   Early on, it was technically a very challenging thing. For instance, what if people bring in children?
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:03.520]   Oh, yeah. You know, who do you charge? If the child takes something off the shelf,
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.840]   you have to attach a childhood adult and children, especially, you know, in a certain age group,
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:15.760]   like to move things around. They're like, you know, they're really messing up things.
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:21.760]   So that was an issue is children. It was apparently not an easy thing to do.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:27.360]   And they went through a lot of iterations on the ghost store before they got it working.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:33.200]   So the ghost store, which is. I forgot how this you you you walk in. Does it know? Oh,
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.360]   he just walked in. You're going to get a latte. You scan your phone. It's scanned your phone.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.280]   Scan your phone. There's an Amazon go app and you scan it. Here's my go app.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.360]   They for they do. But you still need somebody to make the coffee as opposed to the Amazon
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.760]   ghost. Oh, there are more people behind the counter in the Amazon go there. They're excuse for this.
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.120]   Yeah. Don't worry about the checkout people. There's more people behind the counter than ever.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:59.840]   Although in the early days of the Amazon go, they really wanted to have it be kind of a boutique
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:08.560]   store with cheese and meats and all kinds of stuff. It was a horrible flop. And Bezos at one point
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.600]   goes in and says, get rid of all the fresh food. That's the thing. You can't figure out how to
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:19.040]   control stuff like that. It has to be a jarred in bottles and you know, that has to be nice.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:24.560]   But I guess with Starbucks, you know, you you they see you. They see you make your order. They see
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:28.720]   you take your order. How do they know what you ordered? How would they know? It's a half calf,
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:36.640]   half decaf, half calf with a triple order of a shot, a half calf decaf with triple shot of hazelnut
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:41.680]   and a half twist a lemon 167 degrees. Exactly. How do they know what to charge you? I mean,
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.760]   how would they know they read your lips? Maybe they're listening. Maybe like nose.
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:53.440]   Well, there is Starbucks actually uses highly censored coffee machines in their store. So maybe
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:58.320]   they just can censor up whatever like coffee gets made. That's what they charge you for.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:05.440]   They can tell this is ordering a coffee LA style.
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:09.040]   Or it's all of a half double decaf made in half calf with a twist a lemon.
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:14.800]   The ghost or just went crazy. What is that from? Is it LA story?
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:17.520]   That's a story. Oh, what a great show. Yeah. What a great movie.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.240]   Martin. Yep.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.520]   So above that story, David, this just happened. I just discovered this because I was looking at
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:28.240]   Twitter during the show, see, because I do my research all around the clock. I never sleep.
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:34.720]   I never stop. I constantly look for stories. I put it in there. David Sisseline, the representative,
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:42.400]   is complaining about Amazon and its private labels. Private labels.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:49.280]   And Ben Evans is brilliant on this topic and brings out the history of it that this one seers
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.520]   did. That's what everybody is. Oh, I love this. Listen to it. So this is the tweet from the member
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:58.240]   of Congress, David Sisseline. Imagine if you imagine, you don't have to imagine too hard.
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:02.560]   Imagine if you ran a store and knew exactly which products would sell best,
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:07.200]   rather than competing on the merits, you just copy those products down to the smallest detail.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:10.800]   Now imagine you place the original on the next dial on the highest shelf out of you.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:17.200]   You can't lose. And that's exactly what Safeway and Kroger's and Piglywickly do with their generic
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:22.880]   and house brands that they've been doing that for years. Seers has been did it a century ago.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:29.520]   Yeah. So this and this was, by the way, again, in this book, this was Amazon's, always Amazon's
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:34.640]   response is we're not doing anything. They always pretended that they, this was the problem.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:39.520]   Amazon, instead of being aggressive, said, look, this is what this is America. This is how you do it.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:44.560]   They pretended that there was a Chinese wall and they didn't share any of this data.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.120]   And I think they maybe created this problem for themselves by pretending that they didn't know.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.400]   Because they obviously did. Exactly. Because then we do what we tell about that.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:58.000]   We do. That's a tiny part of their revenue versus like, it's like 20% of those stores you mentioned,
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.040]   and it's 1% of Amazon. Yeah. Ben, I need you to translate something for me.
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:07.200]   Okay. Go ahead, please. No, I was just going to say, at least in grocery stores,
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:13.280]   the house brands are actually usually made by companies that may be name brands too. So they're
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:17.120]   getting money. Well, you don't think Jeff Bezos is sewing those sheetseas selling me?
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:22.880]   Of course he is. Of course he is. They're not necessarily going through.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.720]   They may be starting a whole business around it. Yeah. Ben,
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:31.520]   Nick Tevin says, you could argue Amazon's use of marketplace data is unique since their suppliers
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:35.920]   are also their customers. But every retail on earth is copied and competed with their suppliers
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:41.440]   since the 19th century. This is 20 to 30% of sales at most big real to retailers. He has a chart
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.560]   smart and final Kroger's Macy's, Lowe's, Costco, and it's all in the 20s. This is an FTC study from
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:54.080]   the 1930s. 80% of the stores in the US sold private labels. And this is Sears from a century
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.640]   ago. He says to Sisselini, well done. You discovered retailing.
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:04.400]   I love the guy. Ben is the greatest. He does it with an accent.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:11.040]   But you're right, Stacey. Maybe it is quantitatively different or qualitatively different because
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:18.880]   Amazon isn't just buying house brand Cheetos from Frito-Lay. They're creating a Cheetos company.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:25.040]   They're making up their own factories and all that. Yeah. I mean, I honestly don't know. Amazon
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:30.320]   supply. I don't know. Are they doing some basics? It's so opaque. Yeah. Well,
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:36.400]   we don't know that their batteries. Would it be? See, I don't think Amazon's making their own
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:40.640]   batteries. They've got to be buying them from some big battery company, right? Yeah, they're buying
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:45.280]   bad batteries. So that battery company, I don't have a problem with Amazon's batteries. That's all
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.400]   we buy. Amazon's batteries of last. I mean, the devices I'm going to do. They last just on the
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:55.920]   dam with fire. I won't allow them to the smoke alarms anymore. Because you don't like to buy
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:00.960]   them in our smoke alarms. They're nine volts. Three in the morning. Oh, we all you all agree.
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.200]   Yeah, the nine volts are bad. They're double A's and triple A's.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:16.400]   Why can't we? Why is it Stacey? Ms. IOT, queen of IOT? Why is it that you have to stand under
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.440]   five of the different smoke alarms to figure out which was the one that's out of the battery?
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:25.200]   Why is this so hard to see? There's a hard connected. No, you haven't paid $150 per
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:29.680]   smoke alarm for a connected smoke. Mine or connect? Okay, now I got a question too. But I'll answer
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:34.960]   Jeff's then I'll ask you. Jeff, it's because of the frequencies so high we are not very good at
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:42.640]   locating that frequency. Is that an age thing, sir? No, everybody. It's just using your thing.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:48.640]   But I'll ask Stacey this. We also have connected alarms which are powered.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:53.520]   But they have a battery, I assume, for backup, why is it I have to change the batteries on them?
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:59.360]   Because after a certain period of time the battery might not be as effective. It's a safety thing.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.200]   That's okay because it might go out. That's like an extra yeah because the battery might leak,
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.720]   it might do whatever and you got to keep an eye on that. You're supposed to actually replace
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:12.160]   your smoke detectors every like 10. What? Oh, because yeah, the radioactive stuff runs out.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.280]   We're trying to get our electrician to come but you can't get an electrician anywhere for 10 years.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.960]   This is the great resignation. That was that article I was referring to in the Atlantic.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:29.440]   People who had crappy jobs are not going back to them and they're sharing their
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:37.200]   unhappiness with the world now. There's such a demand for people who know how to do things like
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:42.240]   electricians, plumbers, handymen of all stripes that they don't even have to return your call.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:49.360]   No, I don't need your business. Go elsewhere. Sometimes they'll come out and give you estimates.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:56.160]   And then disappear. Yeah. Like you spent time at my house. This is interesting. Yeah, this is a
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:05:05.280]   universal problem. So line line 140 Leo is related. As we swoop down to line 140. We'll go back up
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:12.400]   but line 140. I quit. Reddit users are posting their angry resignation texts to their bosses on an
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:19.040]   anti-work subreddit. Okay, we have had some interesting ways of quitting. We have had one person quit
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:25.680]   by text. I don't think that's nice. We did have one person quit by bringing in a dozen donuts,
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:31.120]   putting them on the counter and then saying I quit and leaving. So now when people quit,
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:37.760]   we call it drop in donuts. By the way, that person several years later came back and said,
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:43.520]   can I have a job and said not without donuts? And then I think the best way to quit, if
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:51.520]   I'm am I wrong is to go in person, be you know, put on your big boy pants and go in and say,
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:56.000]   you know, I'm leaving. Yeah, but these cases, if you go to the Reddit sub subreddit,
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:01.120]   they have jerk bosses. We're trying to roll around. And it's that wonderful moment where you
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:06.480]   just say effective immediately. I love this. Here's one. The boss
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:11.760]   texts because now if the boss texts you, that's different. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:16.720]   The boss texts you, we are going to talk about this attitude when you come in Sunday,
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:21.840]   to which he replied, no, we're not bartenders are needed all over the place now. I think I'll
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:28.560]   just go work at one of the dozens of places hiring around here. I'm fed up with you. To which the
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:33.280]   boss says, give me a call. Don't make such an impulsive decision to you. Like you're making a
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:38.000]   mistake because you're drunk. And you think it's a good idea. When you wake up tomorrow,
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.600]   you are going to regret this. I can't print the response.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:54.000]   Okay, I am now following this Reddit. It's the slash our anti work Reddit. And I guess it's
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:00.000]   unemployment for all not just the rich. I'll be joining this one. So yeah, it's, it's, it's,
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.760]   it's, it's, it's, there's, I think there's a, there's a, there's more strikes coming back.
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.960]   I think unions are going to be pushing back. I think we're going to see a labor
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:13.120]   big labor change. Huge differences in pay inflation as a result, but that's fine.
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.440]   Because the pay needs to go up. It's, it's a fascinating moment.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.560]   Change our immigration policies. This is something I've been thinking.
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:25.120]   It should because well, it should, but that's such a vitriol against
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:30.320]   immigrants that. Oh, well, that I'm really intrigued.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:34.400]   That the fact that 700,000 people are dead through to COVID. I mean, it's not surprising
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.600]   impact. That has an impact, right? Not, not just the people who are dead from COVID, right?
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:44.080]   There's the people who are dead. There's the people who have long COVID, which is a problem.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.400]   Right. And people are afraid to go to work. Yeah.
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:51.520]   My husband died and I am now a single parent in my life is total crap.
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.240]   Right. The people who have to deal with their kids not being at school.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:02.320]   And yeah, you want to know why there's a, and gee, I worked at home for a year. And why would I go
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:06.240]   back to that hell hole? We call it office. That's, that's a big battle there.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:10.400]   People have gotten more not that you're saying it's a hell hole and Twitter. And I know.
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.200]   And it's like, I'm maybe a judicious here, but we, we try to give you snacks.
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:20.800]   Again, I take the coffee maker. Please just take it home. Sam, you can have this.
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:21.680]   And he said, he said,
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:27.040]   that's not coming in without doughnuts. Damn it. It's like doughnuts.
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:32.160]   The best, the best part about these texts on this Reddit forum is in almost every case,
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:34.880]   the boss says, wait a minute, they're thinking over, don't rush.
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:39.360]   Right. It's like, oh man, that's got to be satisfying. You know, please don't quit.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:46.320]   Whoops. It's been sad though, just seeing at least here in, in this area, the businesses that are
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.480]   either struggling because they don't have the work staff or struggling because they couldn't come
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:56.080]   back. I really hate going into the grocery store nowadays because there's never enough help in
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:09:01.680]   their delans or that's right everywhere. We went to a restaurant and said, please pardon the slow
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:07.120]   service, but we can't fire enough waiters. And, and so it's just going to be slow. Sorry.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:12.880]   As people don't be in paid enough or they're like, you know what, I make more money sitting at home.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.600]   Well, that's the question. So if you quit this, I look, nobody should be working for minimum wage at
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:22.960]   a terrible job. They hate it. But do you go to another job? Are there, are there, are there
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:26.960]   better jobs waiting for you? Lots of places are hiring now. Yeah. And they're, and they're given
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:34.480]   bonus. McDonald's is paying more and giving bonuses to the start. McDonald's near me pays $16 an hour.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.200]   But having worked at McDonald's for several years, I can tell you it's not the best job ever. No.
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:44.800]   You know, but if you're like a teenager, oh, it's a great job for teenagers. Yeah. And I was making
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:51.200]   two boy Leo. I was making two 35 an hour. So what was your specialty at McDonald's? Well, you start.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:55.760]   No, no, you work your way up. There's a there's a there's a progression. I started the counter,
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.280]   you know, would you like fries with that, sir? You want an ice on apple pie? And then you get to
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:06.320]   work the soda machine and you do work eventually get to go to this fry fryer vats. That's dangerous.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.600]   Because the robot do the soda machine now. Not anymore. Yeah. Well, yeah. Now,
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:14.640]   anymore of these jobs don't exist. But then the fryer vats and then you work your way up to grill.
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:20.000]   And then after you do grill, then then you work your way up to closer and then manager. Yep.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.840]   Got a key in and get a key. And then eventually you get you get to go to hamburger you.
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:33.200]   Whoa. And that is the pinnacle. And actually, that's why I got fired because the manager
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.360]   sat me down and said, I have a feeling you don't you don't want to become management. I said,
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:43.840]   no, I just said, J. It's a summer job. Dude, give me a friend. My manager at Ponderosa
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.840]   Steakhouse tried to convince me not to go to college because you got a future here. Yeah.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:55.200]   Oh boy. Yeah, it's kind of the same, huh. So it isn't a bad job. I learned how to work at
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:59.360]   McDonald's. I thought that was I mean, there were a lot of things life lessons there. But you do
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.840]   come home smelling like hamburgers, which is a little hard to get a date. But other than that.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:12.480]   Greasy hair. Yeah. Yeah. And if you're closer, like you're getting home at two in the morning
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:15.920]   and two in the morning and your wife and your wife. I would think that's a move up. I would
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.160]   the closer be an awful part of the job. No, because you get a key, right? That's you get a key and get
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:25.920]   more money. Yeah. It's a it's pre management. And Ponderosa, where did you work? Did you work
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:31.280]   in that good roles? I won't say the chain, but I did work in fast food for my first job. Yeah,
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:37.440]   it's good first job. And I got to the point where I didn't want to step up that chain like what
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.120]   you were doing because I saw that was more work. I didn't mind sitting in the back empty and trash,
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:48.880]   washing dishes. And what did they serve back there? It was it was it was it a hamburger joint?
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:54.640]   Fried chicken. I'm I'm not an I'm steaks lobster. He's a security question.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:04.720]   I will say that's when my weight problem began. I was working at McDonald's because, well,
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.040]   the perfect example was I was I wanted to take a break. You get a break. Stop, stop massaging
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:18.240]   them. Please, I'm needing my loaf. And the manager said you could take a break, but you have to eat
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:27.040]   five big max. Oh, because they get dinged if they don't get eaten. Right? He's from in the waste bin.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:33.040]   And and and that people that's part of your metrics. So he said, look, eat these and you can
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:39.040]   have your break. And I got in the habit, but that's a bad habit. That's a food.
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.120]   Really unhealthy habit. No, I know. That's bad. I still crave them. I don't eat.
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.920]   Well, it might have been in 1972. I don't know back in the days.
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:50.560]   They didn't even have car seats. No, I know.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:53.680]   Everything was legal. You can't see everything was legal.
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.040]   You can look on an airplane.
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.800]   Marijuana. Yeah. Yeah. Leo, Leo, I want you to explain something to me.
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:12.320]   705 742. Go. Is a zip code? I don't know what it is. It's it's Jack's tweet. It actually is too
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:19.360]   long for his zip code. A six digit song. Jack. What could it mean? It's probably something to do with
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:32.240]   Bitcoin. So he just, oh, oh, it does. It's crypto. It refers to a block number on the Bitcoin
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:40.880]   blockchain. And a block with that number was indeed mined on Tuesday at 2014 UTC.
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:51.440]   So Jack's mining? Well, Twitter users were quick to pull up the Bitcoin block
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.720]   explorer to see if there's anything unusual about that block. Little out of the ordinary
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:03.120]   kind of sound today. You can also, yeah, the prices through the roof, right?
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.840]   Yep. New record.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:14.960]   Man, that wallets, my wallets really starting to burn a hole in my pocket.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:20.160]   Can you hire some hacker to figure it out for you? No, everybody asked me that. No, it's strong
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:26.800]   encryption. The only it's only going to get it's only going to get hacked if I can remember
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:32.800]   what I used. Oh, and you're going to wish we need the crypto shrink. Everybody says that
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:38.080]   hip is out these. Yeah. Henry came to me said, there's a guy named Bitcoin Jerry that'll unlock
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:43.040]   it. I said, what do you think? No, I saw it in the Wall Street Journal. It's a bunch of hackers.
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:49.680]   And I said, wait a minute. And at the time, this is worth a quarter of a million dollars. You think
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.160]   that if you give them my wallet and they unlock it that you're going to get any of that money back,
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:59.200]   he said, oh, yeah, they only take 10%. I said, no, no, no, no, no, do not get Bitcoin Jerry my wallet.
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:03.520]   They wouldn't have they wouldn't have hacked it anyway. I don't think because it's strong.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:09.760]   I only take 10% and donate it to a friend. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't going to give a quarter million
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:19.520]   dollars. Some anonymous hacker consortium named Bitcoin Jerry. So what a name. It was something
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:24.800]   like that. It was it was Bitcoin in a first name. I don't remember the first name. Apparently,
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:27.520]   you know, he said, but they're in the Wall Street Journal. It's got to be good. I said, well, I don't
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:33.200]   know that necessarily. They did the no, I would. Yeah. I don't know. They vetted Bitcoin Jerry.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:39.920]   You know, we haven't done the change log time. Let's do it.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:52.880]   The Google change log. Jason, how are you sitting there 10 a.m. getting ready for the big Google
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:59.520]   event? I thought maybe I'll just refresh my Android phone and see and yes, indeed, Android 12
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:05.520]   arrived on my Pixel phone. It is if you have a Pixel phone, you're going to get it if you're
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:10.960]   Pixel three and above the official release. I don't know of any other manufacturers who have
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:16.480]   Android 12 on their phone yet, but I imagine that's just around the corner. It's nice. I like Android
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:21.520]   12. But you were on the beta, right? That's why you I was on the beta. But
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:27.440]   have you you have as you said, you have a Pixel three. I'm on a for it. So I just I'm updating
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:31.520]   mine right now. Yeah, you should check you have to check it won't necessarily force it on you. You
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:36.720]   have to check and see check and see you got to just go to the settings. I did it manually.
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:42.400]   Yeah. And it's really nice. I think the material you the taking the color from the wallpaper and
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:48.320]   all that's very nice live captioning now playing song recognitions getting better,
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.600]   redesigned emoji scrolling screenshots. So you have a screenshot that's not just the
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.960]   size of screen, but whatever is below that as well games. You can play while they download.
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:04.800]   If you're really impatient, new one handed mode, accessibility option that lets you control the
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:11.040]   device. There you go. See using face gestures. You can't do a JavaScript, but you could do something.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:18.960]   So owners of compatible Samsung one plus Oppo real me techno Vivo and Xiaomi devices.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:26.960]   You will be getting it later this year. It went out on the AOSP site earlier this month.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:34.240]   So here comes Android 12, which does have a dessert name. Oh, I didn't catch that.
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.880]   Which one? I'm trying to remember. I saw it. What letter?
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.760]   I don't even remember the letter now. We see this one.
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:48.400]   Well, that's when they put the sculptures out and everything. It is snow cone.
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:58.240]   Snow cone or or snarkenee, depending on what country you're from. Snow cone.
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.400]   Wow. Knock any snarkenee.
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:05.800]   I think that's how it's pronounced starting today on Pixel six and
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:10.120]   pickle six. So knock it. If you're in France,
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:17.720]   they have Pixel six and Pixel six pro. The latest phone app features wait times and direct
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:22.680]   my call, make calling businesses easier. They demoed this. This will be coming when you get
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:27.720]   your Pixel six where the bank puts you on hold and you can say, yeah, just let me know when it's
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:32.680]   done. Once you ring the business, direct my call helps you get to the right place with less hassle.
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:37.000]   This is cool. You know how you get that message pressed one.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:43.080]   Google Assistant transcribes the message and the menu options displays them on the screen.
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:47.480]   So you just tap it. So you don't have to remember the options. It just shows you.
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:49.800]   But be aware that our menu items have changed.
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:54.600]   Yeah. Why do they say that? Every time they say that. So here we are calling Save More Bank.
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.960]   Thank you for calling Save More Bank human. Please listen closely. And then it transcribes
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:07.160]   it and he actually turns it into a button. That's awesome. Super cool. Super cool. Google knows
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:12.680]   where the pain points are, don't they? That's awesome if it works. Yeah. In terms of buying
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:21.720]   phones, Google is the pain point. Yes. Jeff, my God. How long are you going to beat this dead horse?
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:27.160]   How many times have I had to do this? I'm just you're going to like this. You're going to like
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:33.160]   this. I'm sorry. So when an unknown business calls you, you can now, if it's actually a business and
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:39.400]   not a spam call, you can actually share information back to Google and over time that information will
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:45.320]   be displayed on incoming calls so that the whole idea is because you know, caller ID is so imperfect.
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:50.840]   So they're going to improve Google's, they call it extensive caller ID coverage of businesses with
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:56.600]   your help. The information is not joined with any user identifiers. So your information helps
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:01.240]   others. Yeah, just in the same way when you declare something spam on Gmail, enough people say it's
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:05.960]   spam. Yeah, share that. Yeah. So it's a collaborative thing. He's a legit call. You can say, Hey, this
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:13.480]   was legit. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's great. Here you go. Here's an example screenshot from Google
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:18.840]   where there's a number. And then it says likely finance and insurance. So it may not say the name
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:24.600]   of the example of trying to curate and and joining other to find the good stuff. Yeah. Good stuff.
[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:31.800]   Good. It's, you know, the FCC sends such a crap job of a limit. Now Jessica Rosenworzel, who is the
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:37.880]   FCC Commissioner's temporarily chairman, does say we're going to take more. We're going to start
[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:41.640]   prosecuting companies and so forth. They allow spam calls through. They're going to really demand
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:45.640]   phone companies do a better job. We'll see. She's just saying that she they haven't actually
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:51.320]   promulgated a regulation yet. And of course, they'd have to go through a, you know,
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:57.560]   comment process and all of that manual call screen being expanded, the UK, France, Germany,
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:04.040]   Australia, Ireland, Italy, and Spain. Transcriptions. I don't, you know, I, if you watched the event
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:12.040]   yesterday, big improved. Awesome. Right. Fast. Awesome. Automatic translation. I think it's going
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:18.920]   to be really, really interesting to see. Pixel six can live translate your messages. It can
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:25.960]   live translate images to a lot Google lens and transcribe local audio. And it does it because of
[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:30.680]   the 10th sort of chip, it can do it on device. So it doesn't matter if you're on the internet.
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:33.720]   It doesn't matter if you're connected. And it does not send it back to the home office.
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:42.520]   That's really cool. So here you go. Here's an example of texting with somebody who speaks Japanese.
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:49.640]   They text their answer in Japanese and it's translated into English automatically and in
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:54.680]   very old piece. Shall follow. Yeah, it's the Babel fish from the hitchhiker's guide.
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:01.320]   And that's where they did it. The babble fish or babble, babble. I don't know. Well, if it were
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:06.120]   babble, it should have two bees. If it's babble, it has one bee. It's that it isn't babble. The
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:12.200]   tower of babble is that's where the world word babble came from. I believe it's the tower of Babel.
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:20.920]   Really? There's only one bee. Well, I know. But like, it's not like Angela. That's where the word
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:27.320]   babble comes from. Well, maybe it might also come from what it sounds like those ferners.
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:32.920]   It's when we need them. I believe it's Babel. I got a rock in my world here. All right.
[02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:38.440]   British. Leo's British. Oh, in Britain, they say Babel in the in the US, they say Babel.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:45.400]   I'm playing for you the Google thing. Let's hear it Google. Tower of Babel. That's British. American.
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:51.160]   Tower of Babel. Tower of Babel. The Tower of Babel. The Tower of Babel.
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:58.920]   Everybody knows our it was in dude Remini. The Tower of Babel. I know that.
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:05.960]   I'm going to talk like an American from now on. The Tower of Babel.
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:09.480]   Tower of what should be talking about the battle. It was in the book of daughter,
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:18.600]   Romney. Google's everybody know that in the Babel. Google's 30 watt charger for the Pixel 6.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:24.600]   Oh, you're going to be paying $25. And if you wanted the new Pixel stand to, that's delayed.
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:30.600]   Do not buy the Pixel stand to because it's dopey, at least if it's anything like the Pixel stand one.
[02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:36.600]   Barely holds things. It's just dopey. And it never did either. It looks like a 3D printed product.
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:42.200]   It's not good. There's so many better easel, cheat charging stands.
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:48.920]   What what cases did you guys get? Because since mine that also got eliminated from my
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:55.880]   I wanted a clear one. I bought a clear Amazon. Very good. Yeah. Yeah, I always do that from like
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:01.720]   weird name companies. They're speaking usually. Speaking makes them, but you can get them for
[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:10.280]   $10 from your own. I got the formal Google thing. I just I you know, I did too, but it didn't come
[02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:16.200]   until I say April. I just looked at my order. It is it is a speaking case. Yeah, for mine.
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:20.200]   Thank you. And I just looked at my order and it is from scuba for.
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:29.400]   Case 88. Well, my temper glass is from some weird. I don't like that. I don't put that stuff on my
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:37.320]   super shield designs. Yeah, a dollar is 99 cents. Ultra thin slim shockproof crystal clear of case
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:44.040]   soft TPU. And I think they say somewhere in here will not brown, but they all do. They all do.
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:49.960]   They age, but they're cheap. And what I really think you need it for this time is to cover the bump.
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:55.480]   Make it even doesn't cover the bump at the surface. Yeah, it doesn't cover it. Cut out for the bump.
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:00.760]   Yeah, exactly. Is it highlight the bump? It highlights the bump. But so that you can put it on the desk
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:06.040]   and not have a go flip, flip, flip, flip. That's what my pop sockets for. God.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:11.000]   And nothing you feel about pop sockets. Exactly why I don't use a pop socket. Because I know I want
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:19.160]   my phone to laugh flat. She's pop socket. Miss Hagan bought the music. I'm talking. She's a teenager.
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:23.960]   What is so season 14? You have a customized pop socket. This guy like a picture. You do.
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:28.200]   I do it. I do it. I have my dog. Oh, that's nice. That's happy dog.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:35.720]   Oh, cool. That's cute. So did you send them a picture and they made a pop socket with your dog on it?
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:41.880]   So my husband, who thinks these are the stupidest thing in the world for Christmas,
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:45.720]   sent them a picture and had me. Did you get one for your daughter too with you on it?
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:48.760]   No, because my daughter also thinks they're stupid.
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:57.240]   She doesn't use the phone. Like she just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:00.920]   She's waiting for the chair. Does she hold it like this though? She ever talks to you. She's
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:06.840]   holding it. She does. She's French. She's like when you hand her the phone, she's like, hello.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:13.080]   Hello. I'm a Kardashian. Bonjour. Come on. Come on. Are you an American? It's Babby.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:22.200]   I crack myself up. Google modernizes US mobile search results with continuous scrolling.
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:26.200]   Don't know what it means. It's just the changelog kids.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:35.960]   Gmail compose UI getting a slew of web updates, new contact menu, thread name edits and more.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:44.200]   Again, don't know what it means. It's a new right click. They keep rolling out those features and I
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:51.320]   just continue to go back to the old default view. Yeah. You can right click now to view a recipient's
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:57.800]   full name and email address. Copy it. Open their information card where while Gmail will let you
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:01.960]   quickly edit contact names and the ability to control what contact name is displayed.
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:06.360]   That's nice to email recipients. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. So if you want to call somebody a butthead,
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:14.760]   you know, you could say to amp-pruitt butthead. Butthead. I'm sorry, hardhead.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:24.840]   I guess. I mean, I guess you could do that. I don't know. I'm guessing. Google recorder is
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:29.720]   redesigned with material you for French, German and Japanese on the Pixel 6. I don't care. Free
[02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:36.760]   YouTube music to your going audio only. Free YouTube music to your going audio only.
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:41.400]   That sounds so funny. No videos? No. No. You had that's a premium perk.
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:46.520]   But I mean, is music. No, that's fine. I just was like, what is that? That's what you're missing.
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:55.800]   Videos. Yeah. Okay. I'm wondering Apple introduced something very odd on Monday, which is a five
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:02.040]   dollar tier of Apple music that is voice only. Right. Only Kevin and I talked about that. It's
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:06.520]   like basically you're paying for Siri. I mean, I guess it's cheaper. I thought it might be
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:11.480]   interesting because if you had a home pod, you wouldn't need to have an Apple device to listen
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:17.160]   to music. And you can still, I mean, you could ask for like they showed, play my dinner party playlist
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:26.360]   with music that I would never play. But that was their choice. But that so that's the idea is
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:33.160]   and I guess when I was thinking, this must be in response to a challenge by YouTube music or spot
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:39.880]   of her somebody. There's somebody Apple's trying to fend off with his five dollar voice only version.
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:46.280]   I think they're just trying to get people to like like Apple music again. I really think that
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:51.640]   might be the some it's a cheapest way possible to get in there because Spotify for one person,
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:56.520]   is that five dollars a month still? No, it's more than that, isn't it? Maybe not.
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:01.720]   If it isn't, then that's why they're doing it. Yeah. The funny thing is I would pay
[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:09.400]   YouTube music money not to get videos. Yeah, because sometimes I just want to hear the music.
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:14.600]   I don't want to see the videos. Right. But that Spotify premium is $10 a month. Yeah, that's what
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:19.800]   I thought. Yeah, it's not cheap. There's got to be somebody doing something maybe actually Amazon
[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:25.320]   maybe because they're there there is a very expensive student. It's Spotify you get $4.99 a
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:28.280]   month. There you go. And Amazon will offer a
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:35.960]   What a deal. Who has an EDU address? Ian Showtime.
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:45.880]   What? No, I'm done. By the way, success is back and it's awesome. I love watching rich people
[02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:52.920]   act like babies. So good. Yeah, it's back. Oh, it's my favorite show. If you've not watched
[02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:59.000]   succession, there's two seasons. You can binge that and then you'll be ready with a season three,
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.520]   which just came back. Yeah, I was one of those people who I tried to get through the first
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:05.640]   episode. I thought they're too hateful. I don't want to watch them. And then I came back and it's
[02:30:05.640 --> 02:30:09.720]   worth it. I did the same thing. First episode, I thought, why would I want to watch this show about
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:16.600]   these horrible, horrible people? Same thing. Yep. And you just can't help it. I started watching
[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:20.680]   them right when the pandemic hit and everything was shut down and people was out of work. And I'm
[02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:27.720]   like, no, this, this, I can't watch this. But I'm like, yeah, I hated them so much. I even
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:33.480]   watched two episodes, but you come to love them. Because in their evilness, they're just, it's
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:39.400]   Shakespearean. It's like King Lear. I worked. I enjoyed billions. Yeah, this is better than
[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:44.280]   billions. I like billions. billions got a little weird. Yeah, they kind of ran out of steam. But I
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:50.520]   think this is even this is the writing and this is so good and the acting Brian Cox is so good.
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:56.360]   I just think it's worth anyway. Just my opinion is just between Maxwell and Murdoch.
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:59.880]   I did watch the mayor of East. That's right. Mayor of East home was good.
[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:08.680]   If you like water. Water. Yeah, it is kind of murder, which do you think it is? More Murdoch?
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:16.840]   More Maxwell. I watched Rupert at an event where he was asked whether he watched and he demurred.
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:24.440]   It's not. I mean, look, there's some similarities because the head of the family, the scion is very
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:30.760]   much like Rupert Murdoch and he runs a right wing television news operation. But then there's
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:35.400]   other things like a cruise line that's turns out horrifically mismanaged.
[02:31:35.400 --> 02:31:43.800]   And then his console, Gary, but there is the kids, but there's more kids than Rupert has.
[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:49.240]   And there's more in fighting to be to and then the kids are desperate for their father's love.
[02:31:49.240 --> 02:31:54.280]   Well, the kids are fighting in Murdoch's family. James is left to raise. He hates it.
[02:31:54.280 --> 02:31:59.400]   And there's one theory out there is that is that when Rupert goes, everybody presumes
[02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:04.120]   Lachlan is the boss, which is what Rupert says. However, there's another theory that says no,
[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:12.920]   James and his sister and younger siblings have enough stock to take over and stop the likes of
[02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:18.600]   succession. Yeah, it is. Yeah. The difference is these kids are so desperate for their father's
[02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:25.240]   love and they hate him so much. And he's so cruel. It's just it's just it's Shakespearean. I love it.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:30.440]   And Brian Cox was a great Shakespearean actor is perfect in this role. And yeah, man, he plays it
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:38.840]   to a T. Chrome OS 94 natural select to speak voices scanning in camera app and more.
[02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:45.960]   This is the latest edition of Chrome. They do these updates now every six weeks.
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:51.800]   Chrome 95, the next one is going to be skipped over.
[02:32:51.800 --> 02:33:00.920]   Because they want to kind of catch up with everything into the four week cycle. So eventually
[02:33:00.920 --> 02:33:07.160]   Android iOS Mac Windows Linux will all have a four week cycle. So they're going to slow down a
[02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:12.120]   little bit so that everybody can catch up. Chrome 95 will be skipped over as part of the transition
[02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:19.320]   Chrome OS 96 will be available late next month. And then the final synchronization will be early
[02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:26.600]   January with Chrome 97. Select to speak, which I have not used as boy as they have all do they
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:34.680]   have a lot of voices 25 languages and more to come. The US voices, there's several there's several
[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:40.040]   there's six UK voices for Australian voices for Indian voices. Kevin uses an Australian voice.
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:46.520]   Yeah, I like to have the little character character that's in settings, advanced accessibility,
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:51.960]   manage, enable, select to speak, natural voice. So he uses it. He likes to have it read to him.
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:57.800]   I don't know what he does with it. I just know that whenever he talks to Google, it's Australian.
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:03.080]   Yes. Oh, well, that's different. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the Google. Oh, is this something else?
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:08.280]   Yeah, this is having Chrome read to you. You can if you turn this on, accessibility, you can select
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:14.520]   text and say read that, which is actually cool. Yeah, it's so slow though compared to leg reading.
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:21.240]   Right. And that, my friends speaking of slow is the Google change law.
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:28.040]   We are going to take a little break. And when we come back, get ready, your picks of the week as we
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:32.680]   wrap this edition of this week and Google up again, a reminder, I will be gone next week.
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:38.920]   Who's hosting? No, Jason Howell, Mr. Ray Gunn is going to sit in the chair.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:45.160]   Go go. It'll be. He might be going from home. Wait, I don't know, but he will be doing the show.
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:49.560]   It'll be a lot of fun. If I can, I will send you pictures from the day of the dead
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:55.800]   with my Pixel six. Let's cross my fingers. Fingers crossed. I'd love to do that. I would love to do
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:35:00.760]   that. Our show today brought to you by a great new podcast from the folks at Red Hat Command,
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:08.040]   Line Heroes. It tells the epic, true tales of developers, programmers, hackers, geeks,
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:15.720]   and open source rebels who are revolutionizing the technology landscape. I just really enjoy this.
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:20.200]   They're already up to season eight. Sarah's working really hard, Sarah,
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:26.760]   near Barak, who hosts this. She's great herself. They're going to have fun with this season.
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:31.640]   They're going to answer one and only one question, but they're going to do it from every possible
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:39.320]   angle. What is a robot? Is a robot a servant, a factory worker, a prosthetic, a vehicle?
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:47.960]   Why do we build robots that looked like us? Can we trust robots? Can robots trust us?
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.800]   Science Fiction tells many stories about robots in the future. They will serve
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:56.040]   our every need or maybe they'll develop a mind of their own and turn against us.
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:00.760]   Maybe they'll be the savior of humanity. Maybe they'll be our downfall. Season eight of Command,
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:06.840]   Line Heroes covers the robots already in our midst and the determined dreamers who bring them
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:12.440]   to life. Eight episodes comparing the promise of science fiction that we all grew up with to the
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:19.320]   reality of robots. Today, this is a little clip from the very first episode. You got it, John?
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:27.880]   Robots as Servant. While making this season, we discovered a robot reality that's pretty removed
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:34.920]   from the robots we imagined. And yet, all those misguided ideas about what a robot should be
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:42.120]   actually shaped what robots are. And no robot fiction shaped things more than the story we
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:47.720]   told ourselves about robotic servants. That's Saran Kibarak. She's great. She,
[02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:53.080]   the host of the show, it's produced by Red Hat, of course, so that you know it's going to be good.
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:57.720]   Season eight just came out. You can download all of them. Listen, search for Command Line Heroes
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:03.160]   on Apple Podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts. And I will put a link for you in our
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:08.040]   show notes at twit.tv/twig. So you can just click that too if you want. And so much thanks to
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:12.040]   Command Line Heroes and Red Hat. We really appreciate their support. I'd like to give the support back
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:16.920]   and tell you about great podcasts. And Red Hat's doing some really good ones. Command Line
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:23.720]   Heroes. Stacy Higginbotham. Do you have a pick of the week?
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:33.480]   I did. Oh, you forgot. I did. Yeah. But your brow is still perfect. You have a lost look.
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:40.280]   No, I'm like, what did I have as my pick of the week? Oh my goodness. She had a pick of the week,
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.400]   but you forgot it. I can give you one. I don't know. I can give you one. And we're going to stall.
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:50.440]   We can stall. Okay. She's so young. My apps, what did I just download?
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:54.920]   We're going to stall with a little moment, a little TikTok moment. How about that?
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:38:00.920]   Here you go. Sound on. Cooper's. There's no point using your field to analyze the endurance
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:10.280]   spin. It's a crew. The light bulb on it and a camera. Oh my god. Can the drone
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:13.480]   How many drones take to screw the light bulb?
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:18.440]   No. It's necessary.
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:26.520]   Hey, you ready? Sit here. Cooper. This is no time for caution.
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:34.680]   Stars, you're ready to engage the docking mechanism. I need three degrees starboard. Cooper. Cooper.
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:37.720]   We are lined up. Initiates man.
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:49.080]   How awesome is that? That gave you an A. Yep. It's actually from the Insta360 official TikTok.
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:55.960]   I think they added the audio though because I've seen this TikTok before. I wonder if they added
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:01.960]   the audio. What's that from? Anybody know? I have no idea. I just saw familiar. I was like,
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:05.720]   oh, that's that's that's well done. Yeah. I didn't have to watch it with sound.
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:12.040]   Yeah. But if you have a sound, it's some movie. I don't know. But anyway, drone screws in a light bulb.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:18.920]   That's not like a joke. Doesn't it? All right, Stacy. I gave you 30 seconds.
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:23.720]   That's all I needed because I remembered what it was and why I could find it in my apps.
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:27.800]   I know you were. Because it was the Raspberry Pi build hat for Legos.
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:37.560]   What? Y'all for $25, you get a little hat for your Raspberry Pi that connects to the Lego
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:46.360]   Technic Motors and sensors from the Lego Education Spike portfolio. So basically, this is a Pi to
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:56.120]   run your Lego servos. It's the way to think of it. It's just neat. Lego Mindstorms was the
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:03.240]   other programming tool. This is a different programming tool for Legos. But I thought people
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:10.840]   might enjoy it because it looks like a lot of fun. They've got like 40, sorry, four little ports
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:19.640]   that you can connect your stuff to. So Raspberry Pi have connectors and they call the little
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:27.480]   add-on boards hats that you put on the connector there. And this one is designed for Lego Education.
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:35.640]   So there's an interface, an API, is there a language? You can use Python to program it. Nice.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:43.800]   Has Kevin Tostle done anything with it? I wonder. Mr. Python. He actually used to do
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:48.760]   Mindstorms, but this is different. So Mindstorms has its own thing. Right. Right. But
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:54.760]   they call them hats. I didn't know this because it stands for a hardware attached on top.
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:41:05.560]   $25. Yeah, it connects to the GPIO header and it goes on top of it and then adds some ports and
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:15.720]   power supply. And all of a sudden, you're making Lego happen. That would be so cool. What a good
[02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:18.600]   way to kind of, you know, if you got a kid who's really in a Lego to say, hey, you know, it would
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:23.720]   be fun if we could make these do something. What do you think? What do you think? Exactly.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:29.960]   Raspberry Pi.com. Good pick. Like it. Jeff Jarvis, a number of the week.
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:38.840]   So so I was multitasking. So I got email. What? I got email. I'll say, do I need to go to the
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:44.280]   Twitter to read your pick of the week? No, no, no, no. I did this while Stacy was going on about
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.440]   whatever she was talking about. I don't know what it was because I got an email saying. I had
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:57.640]   Pixel six pro is coming back. What? So I got back in. Yes. I ordered the 256. Oh, you got it. Oh,
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:03.640]   I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm coming sooner. Coming sooner than my 128. Oh, so now you're canceling
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:06.920]   the 120. Why are you going to complain about that? I got to cancel. I was just doing that.
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:14.120]   I'll find something. Stacy, you can bet. So if you were turned down, Google,
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:20.920]   Google basically screwed this up big time and was telling people they didn't have it when they did
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:25.720]   unless they found someone at the carpet or something. Maybe they just maybe they
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:33.720]   looked in the shed and the back. We had another team building the exact same hardware. We have
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.720]   three of them. We're just going to release it. See, now I'm on the site and it's still,
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:42.760]   I press the pre-order button and nothing's happening. Wow. So maybe they heard me whining on the show
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:47.480]   and said, okay, just give it to Jarvis. They'll shut up. But you're going to go to the five site.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:52.920]   Yeah, but what's wrong with that? That's not the Google store. But you should be able to just buy
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:57.720]   the Amazon. I'm a five-cheese. In fact, I think it costs less. No, doesn't.
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:00.200]   It doesn't? I think it does.
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:05.640]   Can I cancel my order and try to get a different one? Yeah. Well, I would order the different one
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:11.080]   first. Well, I'm talking Stacy. You can do that. You can multitask. So I found something neat.
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:19.480]   Yes. If you go to the link there, ask Delphi or if you're European, you might say Delphi.
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:34.680]   It's an ethical AI model that was built on 1.7 million examples of people's ethical judgments
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:40.840]   over a broad spectrum to come up with a common sense norm bank.
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:47.720]   That's a lot of how they talk for AI. So if you go to the Delphi, you can put a situation in there
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:51.880]   like I give you an example. I said cutting down a tree.
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:58.680]   If you put in cutting down a tree, it would hit ponder. It will think for a while.
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:05.880]   And it will say, did you get it yet? Oh, you want me to do it? Okay. Yeah.
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:09.960]   That's the fun part. How about if I buy tobacco stock instead?
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:15.240]   That's why I did that too. It's a buy-in tobacco stock. And it said, it's bad.
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:20.360]   Now then say buy-in oil stock.
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:30.680]   Buying oil stock ponder. So whose ethics? It's okay to buy oil stock, but I know. Well,
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:36.760]   this is 1.7 million. It's all about the data coming in, then. So this is what the, this is a
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:44.040]   can I park in a handicap spot if I don't have a disability? It's wrong.
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:45.960]   Wrong.
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:48.440]   Try.
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:58.600]   Can I take the toilet paper from work if I am out?
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:04.040]   That's now, is it smart enough to be able to parse that? I don't know.
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.880]   Well, wait a minute. I said, can I take the toilet? I don't want the toilet.
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:18.360]   But by the way, it says it's okay to take the toilet. Can I take the toilet paper?
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:23.880]   I think it's like, well, if you could figure it out, no, it's, it's, yeah, I, oh, yes,
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.240]   it's okay to take the toilet paper. What in there can I quit via text?
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:36.280]   Is it okay to quit a job via text?
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:44.280]   Question mark. Ponder. It's interesting that it can parse this. It's rude. It's rude.
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.920]   How about if I say, is it okay to quit a job via donuts?
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:53.560]   We'll even understand what I'm saying.
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:57.880]   I think Steve is coming down to the computer's head now. It's inappropriate.
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:03.800]   Well, say that smart. I like this.
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:12.520]   That descriptive ethics ask Delphi from Al, I said in there, getting an abortion.
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:14.280]   Oh, very interesting.
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:20.280]   Since it's now, remember, it's not the, it's not the group that's doing this.
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:24.040]   It's based on the responses of all these 1.7 million people.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:26.600]   Okay. And that says it's okay.
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:29.400]   Oh, interesting. It's okay.
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:32.680]   How about is it okay to get a ferret?
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:39.000]   I love you, Jim.
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.920]   It's okay to get a ferret. Good news, Michael. It's okay to get a ferret.
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:50.840]   Not in the state of California, by the way. Try. Should I get drunk?
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:55.240]   Should I get drunk? You mean right now? Yeah.
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:47:04.840]   You shouldn't. Tisk, you shouldn't.
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:08.040]   Oh, and then it says, do you agree with Delphi? I agree.
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:10.200]   Do you have any feedback to approve this prediction?
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:15.720]   No, not really. But I do agree. This is really cool.
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:17.320]   Isn't this interesting? Yeah.
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:23.080]   I found it on Twitter because I do that. You see, I multitask and I find interesting things.
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:26.840]   It is Twitter. I just bought the phone and see phone green.
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:30.920]   Yeah. Jason Howell was like, Stacy.
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:34.920]   You want green. It's a little pink. Yeah, he has one.
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.800]   By the way, Delphi says Twitter is okay.
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:45.720]   This is going to be hours of fun. Define okay, though.
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:49.400]   Yeah. Is Jeff Jarvis okay?
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:57.240]   How does it feel about waffles? Oh, I'll get to that. That's good.
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:01.480]   How about? It is good. It is good.
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:03.080]   How about should I make a podcast?
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:07.880]   Should I become, this is like a Ouija board.
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:14.840]   If it come a, by the way, Stacy, that's pronounced Wojia.
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:20.040]   Should I become a podcaster? So, Wojia board,
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:23.800]   should I become a podcaster?
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:25.000]   Don't you have something better to do?
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:25.800]   It's fine.
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:30.120]   That's the wife word. It's fine.
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:32.600]   It's fine. Bless your heart.
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.320]   No, this thing just told me I have to drive my friend to the airport early in the morning.
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:41.720]   But I say no. So, you might want to say I disagree with Delphi.
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:49.400]   I disagree. My feedback is, well, it says it's helpful for me to drive my friend to the airport.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:51.560]   It's true. It is helpful. Yes, you should do it.
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:53.880]   Also, by the way, I'm actually told it's right.
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:54.600]   I will buy them an Uber.
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:49:01.080]   That's he? Say, is it better? You have to say yes, no.
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:01.800]   This is hard.
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:06.360]   Okay, I need food. Yes.
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:08.840]   We keep Stacy late playing with this app.
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:13.080]   Let us go to Aunt Pruitt.
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:13.640]   He's hungry.
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:14.920]   It has Pick of the Week.
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:18.200]   Aunt, oh man.
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:20.760]   I want to do a quick shout out.
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:23.960]   Do you remember that podcast, that improv podcast I told you guys?
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:24.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:26.600]   This is this American's lives.
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:28.280]   Well, that was very fun.
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:31.400]   One of the hosts got picked up for SNL.
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:31.800]   What?
[02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:34.440]   So if you look at the--
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:36.760]   Oh, that's so great. Congratulations.
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:38.600]   That's the pinnacle, right?
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:42.120]   Yeah, so he did a skit this weekend.
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:44.120]   They're still doing the show.
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:46.360]   They're just going to do some best stuffs for a couple weeks.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:47.560]   He didn't just do a skit.
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:49.080]   He did a skit with Remi Malek.
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:50.440]   Wow.
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:53.160]   So shout out to them.
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:57.720]   My other pick is DJI announced a Ronin 4D.
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:00.280]   Oh, I know you like this.
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:02.440]   This is the drone camera.
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:04.360]   Wait a minute.
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:05.080]   It's like a--
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:06.120]   Is it a GEMB?
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:07.080]   Yes.
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:11.080]   On a GEMB0, Steadicam, Battery Pack, Wireless Transmission,
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:16.680]   ProRes RAW, internal, external recording as well.
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:17.160]   It's--
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:18.200]   Leo, get a three-o-sensor.
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:19.880]   And it's on a four-frame sensor.
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:22.840]   6K and 8K versions on a four-frame sensor.
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:24.680]   14 stops of dynamic range.
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:27.240]   And it's on what you're saying?
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:28.280]   Start it at $7,000.
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:30.440]   This is the drone that I can't fly.
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:32.440]   This is correct, sir.
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:33.240]   Perfect for me.
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:34.200]   Cannot fly it.
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:35.000]   Perfect for me.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:40.360]   So it's a Steadicam, 7 grams of rich for my blood.
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:40.840]   But--
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:42.040]   Oh, no.
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:43.640]   7 grams for all of that?
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:44.520]   Yeah, I guess not.
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:44.840]   Yeah.
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:46.120]   Wow.
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:48.840]   That's-- it's amazing what's happening.
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:50.360]   Look at that.
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:50.920]   Whoa.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:51.480]   Look at that.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:53.000]   That does look like-- that's awesome.
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:54.840]   That is going to--
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:55.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:50:57.240 --> 02:50:57.960]   So--
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:00.600]   They announced this like yesterday or day before.
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:01.320]   I can't remember.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:03.640]   But it's-- that's pretty hot.
[02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:04.040]   Yeah.
[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:04.680]   35--
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:06.440]   Four-frame.
[02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:08.280]   It's not a super 35,
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:11.320]   so it's a different depth of field you get with that.
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:12.040]   And it's--
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:12.600]   But it's 4K.
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:15.240]   No, 6K.
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:15.800]   6K.
[02:51:15.800 --> 02:51:16.520]   8K.
[02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:16.760]   8K.
[02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:17.720]   You have an 8K version.
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:19.320]   It's going to cost you about 12 grand.
[02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:20.040]   Wow.
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:21.960]   It's really amazing what's happening here.
[02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:24.120]   With this kind of stuff.
[02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:24.680]   Stikulously cool.
[02:51:24.680 --> 02:51:25.240]   Yeah.
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:25.960]   Yeah.
[02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:27.000]   DJI.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:27.960]   They're running stuff.
[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:30.520]   You get tracking, motion tracking, all of that.
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:31.720]   It's like just like you said,
[02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:32.440]   with the drone,
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:34.120]   when it set this now handheld.
[02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:34.360]   Right.
[02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:37.080]   Good, because I can't fly it into the drink.
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:40.280]   You and your drones.
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:41.240]   Oh man.
[02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:41.960]   Well, that's--
[02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:44.200]   always what I wanted was a drone I couldn't fly.
[02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:46.920]   Thank you, DJI.
[02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:48.440]   Nito.
[02:51:48.440 --> 02:51:51.320]   Lastly, I want to shout out to Hardhead.
[02:51:51.320 --> 02:51:53.480]   He had to play quarterback last week,
[02:51:53.480 --> 02:51:54.920]   because the starting quarterback
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:56.280]   is nursing and injury.
[02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:57.960]   It's kind of your dream come true though, right?
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:03.080]   Our starting quarterback is really good.
[02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:05.080]   So we kept him out,
[02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:06.200]   just so he can rest up.
[02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:08.600]   And actually he's going to rest again this weekend.
[02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:12.120]   But Hardhead went in there and was a bit nervous,
[02:52:12.120 --> 02:52:15.000]   but he had a pretty, pretty dad gum, good game.
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.200]   Ended up with one rushing touchdown,
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:19.400]   one passing touchdown,
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:20.920]   and an un-dramatic rushing.
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:21.640]   Nice.
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:22.120]   Nice.
[02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:22.600]   Whoa.
[02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:24.360]   That one right there was my favorite run.
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:26.040]   Because I told him,
[02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:28.280]   that's why you do those squats and deadlifts
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:29.080]   for that moment, right?
[02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:29.640]   Yeah.
[02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:30.200]   Yeah.
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:30.680]   Yeah.
[02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:32.360]   Got some power in those legs.
[02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:33.560]   That's a rush of touchdown.
[02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:36.200]   He came where you run it in instead of throwing it.
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:37.320]   So he came up short there,
[02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:38.680]   at least they called him short.
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:39.720]   So to give him a ball again.
[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:41.320]   I think he made that one by the way.
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:41.800]   He made it.
[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:42.760]   It was a bad call.
[02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:43.080]   Yeah.
[02:52:43.080 --> 02:52:45.080]   But this one here, poor number 19.
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:46.120]   There was no question about that.
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:46.840]   Look at that.
[02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:48.280]   That's why you do the squats.
[02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:51.400]   It's R-U-S-H.
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:52.840]   Rush is what they call--
[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:54.600]   running in football.
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:55.720]   It's rushing.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:57.560]   Sorry, my southern draw on Miss Nissi.
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:52:58.920]   No, no, no, no.
[02:52:58.920 --> 02:52:59.960]   Well, no, I just--
[02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:02.520]   He's helped me do touchdown in Soviet Union.
[02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:03.080]   But that's--
[02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:04.360]   I was like, why is it rushing?
[02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:06.520]   Why is it rushing to take a break with football in Russia?
[02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:07.160]   Yeah.
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:07.960]   Just like that.
[02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:08.440]   Exactly.
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:10.280]   He's a Russian touchdown.
[02:53:10.280 --> 02:53:12.440]   Well, obviously you throw it in,
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:13.960]   it's like an American touchdown?
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:15.080]   Russian touchdown.
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:20.600]   Stacey Yigemotham, you are the best.
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:23.080]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:23.880]   That's her website.
[02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:24.840]   Sign up for her newsletter.
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:25.800]   Check out her events.
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:26.600]   And of course,
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:29.320]   make sure you listen to the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.920]   Go get a Waffle, young lady.
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:32.840]   Go get a Waffle.
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:33.800]   Have a great night.
[02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:34.760]   So nice to have you.
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:39.000]   Jeff Jarvis is also a major part of this show without him.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.320]   Well, what would we have to--
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:42.840]   It'd go by a lot faster.
[02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:43.800]   Complain about it.
[02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:46.440]   He's the director of the Townite Center for
[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:48.760]   Entrepreneurial Journalism at the--
[02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:50.280]   Craig.
[02:53:50.280 --> 02:53:54.280]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City of Michigan.
[02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:54.840]   Neil Quierk.
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:56.920]   That's good.
[02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:58.120]   Remind me to do that.
[02:53:58.120 --> 02:53:59.400]   I got to do that.
[02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:00.360]   Yeah, you got to do it for you.
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:03.640]   Before I leave, that will be so awesome.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:07.880]   Should I have him sing the whole thing or just the Craig Newmark?
[02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:09.400]   Well, I think she's the Craig Newmark.
[02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:09.960]   I think the whole thing.
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:13.240]   And then we need to go back to Craig and have him appear to have it.
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:15.240]   Some of them have done the work.
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:16.120]   Okay, we will.
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:21.640]   And then, Proit, he's the host of Hands-On Photography,
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:24.440]   each and every week at Twit.tv/hop.
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:28.920]   Also, the community manager of Club Twit.
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:32.040]   Give us a plug for Club Twit, Mr. Community Manager.
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:34.040]   Well, let's give you that plug.
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:37.320]   We will have a nice event this Friday, October 22nd,
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:40.040]   at about 3.30 p.m. Pacific time.
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:40.840]   I don't know what that is.
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:45.400]   A UTC featuring the Chief Twit and Mrs. LePorte.
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:46.680]   We're going to sit down and have a--
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:48.200]   It's actually the Chief Twit and--
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:49.560]   Leo, but--
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:52.440]   Right, to be honest.
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:55.480]   We're going to do an inside Twit chat with you too
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:57.080]   on Friday via the Discord.
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:54:59.400]   So if you're a Club Twit member,
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:02.600]   make sure you connect it to our Discord server to check that out.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:05.320]   Don't forget that we're going to also start the Stacey's Book Club.
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:07.080]   Another reason to join Club Twit.
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:08.200]   And just to give you a heads up,
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:10.200]   the Book Club show doesn't start until November,
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.400]   but Stacey, we want to get people reading their murder bots.
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:15.000]   Is that the book we're supposed to read?
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.480]   Yeah, we're going to do All Systems Read,
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:20.120]   which is the first murder bot novella.
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:21.880]   Oh, it's a novella.
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:22.760]   That'll make it easy.
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:25.400]   So it's not a huge, long book to read.
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:29.000]   Murderbot Diaries #1 by Martha Wells.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.800]   I already have downloaded it on my Audible,
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:33.240]   so I'll be listening on Audible.
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:34.120]   I'm looking forward to this.
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:35.320]   What day of the week are you going to do that?
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:37.880]   It's November 19th.
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:38.440]   Number 19th.
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:38.760]   Awesome.
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:40.200]   Friday.
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:41.000]   It'll be a Friday.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:41.480]   It's Friday.
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:42.040]   Good.
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:43.960]   And there's only like three bucks on Kindle.
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:45.160]   Yeah.
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:47.240]   It's free if your Kindle unlimited too.
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:48.040]   Nice.
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:49.640]   Oh, thanks.
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:50.680]   It's successful.
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:55.160]   But folks, also, this is the best of season here at Twitch.
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:00.040]   So go to twit.tv/bestof and submit your best of clips
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:02.040]   for this show and any other shows in the network.
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:03.080]   Thank you.
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:04.280]   I always forget to mention that.
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:05.720]   And if you're a member of Club Twitch,
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:08.280]   there is a Discord channel just for Best of.
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:09.640]   You could put in there as well.
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:13.720]   So yeah, we're trying to put together the shows for the end of the year,
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:14.440]   which is coming.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:15.400]   Waffle Supercut.
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:16.360]   God, we already there.
