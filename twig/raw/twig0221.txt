[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.100]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers. Really anything we feel like covering,
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.100]   because we've got a brilliant panel here. Myself excluded. And if they want to talk about it,
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.100]   we'll talk about it starting with Jeff Jarvis over here, Professor of Journalism, City University
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.100]   of New York with his Q-cat in hand. He's on Google+, as Jeff Jarvis of course, and his
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.100]   book Public Parts is on Amazon along with Gutenberg the Geek, his Amazon single.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.100]   Gutenberg the Geek now available in Chinese, German, Italian and Audible.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.100]   How do you say Geek in Chinese, do you know? I have no idea what it is.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.100]   It's nerd in German. It translated back to Geek. I translated the cover, translated back to Geek.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.100]   But the Germans didn't like that and so it was Gutenberg, they're neared. The Italian was Gutenberg,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.100]   Ilgeek. Ilgeek. Ilgeek. Ilgeek. Colino. Ilgeekek.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:27.100]   I love Italians. That's Gina, Japan, speaking Italians. She's our favorite Italian from ThinkUp.com,
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100]   where they are now raising, how is the fundraising going over there?
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   It's going great. It's going great. Our goal was a thousand subscribers.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   We're counting, measuring our success in people rather than money. And we're in the high 800s, I think.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   873. Come on people, come on by the end of the show.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   Come on, give the address to you. By the end of the show, we got to hit a thousand.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.100]   Are you, Geeks or are you mice?
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.100]   127 more people shouldn't be too hard to get.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   We're in good shape. We're in good shape and I'm sure this is in the small part of the Twitch.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.100]   And I'm wearing my fan girl gear. I was up at Google this weekend.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   Oh, which Google were you up at? I was at the Mountain View, the Plex, the Canono Google Plex.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.100]   Yeah, it was at, they had the Mentor Summit for Google Summer of Code,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   which is an open source mentoring program. I was a mentor this summer. I had a great student.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.100]   And then they have a conference for the mentors. So I got to get the spend the weekend and visit the store.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   And I saw the Android statues. I posted a picture on my Google Plus. So it was a lot of fun.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.100]   I was totally geeked out about it. I hadn't really spent time. I had never done the campus tour or been in the store.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.100]   So it was really, it was fun to be there.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.100]   Is it anything like, I love going there.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.100]   Is it anything like the movie The Internship?
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.100]   Well, it's funny because I, I mean, I barely recently saw The Internship and they shot a lot of it in building 43,
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.100]   which is the building with the steps. So, I like walked in there. I was like, oh, yeah, this is where the movie is.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.100]   I mean, it's a lot brighter kind of in the movie, but I got to see there was like a plastic bin of those paddles.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.100]   The yes, no, you know, one side is a few inside is red. I got to see paddles.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.100]   And you know, that whole outside area where they're sitting outside and the Google bikes, of course, the multi-colored bikes,
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.100]   which is kind of sit around campus. So, yeah, it did feel a little bit like it was the movie, except, you know, it was a little overcast at time.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.100]   You know, it wasn't, it wasn't as perfectly lit, of course, as the movie. But it was, yeah, it was a really, it was a really fun weekend.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.100]   I mean, you know, it's an office park. I think I built up in my head, you know, after all the articles that you read about how amazing it is to work, work there.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.100]   I mean, you know, there's lots of primary colors, but, you know, it's an office park.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.100]   And yes, there's a slide in one building from the second floor to the first floor, and there are like random burning men, you know, shark fins, like, in the middle of the concrete.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.100]   I mean, there's some quirky stuff here and there, but it's, you know, it was fine.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.100]   I remember going to Intel. I remember going to Intel back in the day when I worked on, helped work on that tablet over there.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:56.100]   And the soulless, just cubicle after cubicle after cubicle in Dilbertland, Google is still different from that.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.100]   Although Andy Grove at the time, the CEO of Intel was quite proud of that. He was in a cubicle, not in a big corner office.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.100]   You're suffering. So I'm suffering.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   There's a great scene in Dave Edgar's circle, which is, I haven't finished, but so far quite enjoyable, in which the young woman protagonist arrives at her new job at the circle, which is pretty clearly Google.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:34.100]   It might be Facebook. The founders in a hoodie. So maybe it's a mix, but she arrives and she's blown away by, you know, there's buildings where it's all glass.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.100]   So you're working like floating in space. You look down and you can see the people blow you and stuff.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   And then she gets to her cubicle and it's burlap and the chair's broken and she has a CRT display and she gets really bummed out.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:55.100]   She goes, "What?" And then her new boss and old friend laughs and says, "It cost me a lot of money to get this thing here. This is not where you're sitting."
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.100]   It is not in Otek.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.100]   Is that book going to drive me crazy?
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.100]   Yes.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:10.100]   Yeah, you know, I heard a lot about that book. Kate Lassie wrote The Boy Kings says that Edgar's basically completely ripped off her book.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.100]   Oh, interesting. Well, I'll have to read that.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.100]   It's a Luddite's point of view, frankly.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   Yeah. Yeah, she said that he oversimplified and, you know, it was a lot of hyperbole and whatever.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.100]   She says that he co-opted her experiences as a young woman and decided to rewrite it.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.100]   Is that the person who wrote Stephen Levy quoted?
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.100]   I'm not sure if Levy--
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.100]   I'll have to read this.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.100]   He quoted someone else. It was a really interesting story.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.100]   He heard about this Romana Claf about Google that was not published and he asked permission to read it.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.100]   And he used some of the atmosphere from that in his book, getting clearance from the author as to what was real and what was fictional.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100]   But the book never went anywhere. And now that Edgar has his book out,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100]   she said, "We'll screw it." And she pulled it back out. And this--
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.100]   And it's not now up as an e-book.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.100]   Good.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.100]   Oh.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.100]   This might be the same person.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.100]   I'm going to have to read all of these.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.100]   Sometimes fiction is the best way to understand what's going on in real life.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.100]   To me, oftentimes.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.100]   I do like your new header image on your Google+ page.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.100]   Oh, thank you.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.100]   I think somebody's headed to Brooklyn.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   I'm excited.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   Don't take a left at the Midtown Tunnel, though. You've got to keep going.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.100]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.100]   I guess Dan the BQE.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   Yeah, the BQE. Very important.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.100]   I love it.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.100]   Thinkup.com. Everybody should go there and sign up.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.100]   I can't wait.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.100]   I'm very excited.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.100]   It's going to launch what is January, right?
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.100]   January, January 15th.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.100]   The hosted version of Jim's amazing analytics software.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.100]   Well, I guess really in some ways the big story this week is not a Google story.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.100]   [GASPS]
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.100]   You're gasping.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.100]   It's an Apple story and maybe a Microsoft story.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   So it's not really a big story.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.100]   But we can interpret it through the Google Prism.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.100]   How about that?
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100]   That's OK.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.100]   One thing that struck me is it was going on in no offense.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.100]   You do great coverage.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.100]   But my God, how many live blogs are the same PR do you need in life?
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.100]   I know.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   Well, that's why you should watch us so you don't have to collate all these different
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100]   live blogs.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   It's true.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.100]   So you don't have to go through all the effort of waiting for the refresh and all the stuff.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   You just tell you what's going to go on.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.100]   And we make it a little entertaining.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.100]   We joke around a little bit mock people's clothing things like that.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.100]   Yeah, you can't take it too seriously.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.100]   What we're having to do.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   No.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100]   You got to have fun with it.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.100]   What were the cuffs that was it?
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.100]   Who was wearing those that silly shirt?
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.100]   Was that any cue?
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.100]   He was like wearing a shirt that required cufflinks with no cufflinks.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.100]   And it just was this.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.100]   And then of course Tim Cook instead of saying the dark night, he's looking at Batman.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.100]   He's called it the Black Knight, which is like from Monty Python, I think.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.100]   So, you know, we have fun with it.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.100]   But I think it's a very it's a big challenge for Apple because you have such a successful
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.100]   product that really doesn't need a lot of updates.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.100]   So, really, it's a question of putting fins on the car right now.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.100]   And one of the things we've observed, and I think this is Apple's really bearing this
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.100]   out, is it's now fashion.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.100]   It's no longer technology.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.100]   It's now fashion.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.100]   And Apple, there's Eddie Cue in his fashionable whatever.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.100]   I see that style.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.100]   That people wear that?
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.100]   I thought like he was trying to put the cufflinks in and they said, Eddie, you're on.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.100]   And he goes, oh, screw it and throws them and runs out.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   I've done that.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.100]   But I think Apple, you know, they hired their new director of retail is the former CEO of
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:46.100]   Burberry or soon to be former CEO of Burberry, a fashion, you know, brand.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:51.100]   In fact, somebody who took a stodgy British brand and made it a fashion brand.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   They've hired other fashion folks.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   And you got to think Johnny Ive, what does he do as much as make beautiful, I mean, makes
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.100]   great products, but they're beautiful products.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.100]   They're about fashion.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.100]   Design is somewhat of a fashion thing.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.100]   And I think the technology is taking a backseat now to how it looks.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.100]   That's really smart about salvation, though.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.100]   Well, and it makes sense.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.100]   When you have a mature technology, that's how you do it.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.100]   Detroit learned that nine years ago.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.100]   Well, another way to put it, though, is fashion is all smoke and mirrors.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.100]   I worked in Kanye and asked, which is an amazing empire built on just that.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.100]   What makes, you know, a shirt, a shirt is a shirt, but no, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:34.100]   But it's, but what makes a boog outfit different from a real simple outfit is, is either.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:40.100]   But if you're thinking, if you're triples made of ether, if you're trying to sell a mature
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.100]   product, and you're most importantly trying to get somebody to take the last year's product
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.100]   and buy a new one, which isn't much improved, how do you do it?
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.100]   You do it with looks.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   You do it with, oh, well, flatten the icons.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.100]   Oh, we'll make it thinner, lighter.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.100]   Now, having said that, I think the iPad Air is significantly lighter.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.100]   It goes from 1.4 pounds to one pound.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100]   That's something I needed to do.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.100]   It was really kind of a heavy device.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   And I think that's...
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   I'm so used to my seven inch tablet that when I see people on the subway with a 10 inch,
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.100]   I think they've got the kitty version.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   Right.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.100]   Or perhaps I should say the Fox News version.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.100]   I'm just kidding.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.100]   The Shepherd Smith version.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.100]   The Shepherd Smith version.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.260]   And then, of course, Apple responded to the Nexus 7, which has a very high resolution
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:29.100]   display, by making its 7.9 inch tablet, the iPad Mini, also now with Retina display.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.100]   In fact, a couple of dots per inch better than the Nexus 7.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   So, I mean, that really...
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.100]   But I thank Google, because I think Apple could have done this a year ago.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.100]   They didn't, and I think Google put the pressure on them.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   But one thing that didn't happen was you didn't see a significant price drop.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.100]   But what you did see is Apple continuing to sell the old Mini and oddly enough, the iPad
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.100]   II, which is now three generations old, at lower prices.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:01.100]   The iPad II, I think we all agreed, was designed to aim to the education market.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.100]   And the Mini is the lowest price iPad at $2.99.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.100]   Coming...
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:12.100]   I think, again, responding to the $2.29 price point for the Nexus 7.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.100]   And for me, the technology advances are just the small size and the thinness.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:23.100]   Yeah, because that is an engineering feat, right, to get these things so light and thin.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:30.100]   But then they have to do the chamfered edges and iOS 7, to kind of sexy it up for regular people.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.100]   And do slow-mo videos.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.100]   Oddly, I would, of all people, be most susceptible, as I would think.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   I don't feel any urge to buy a new iPad.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.100]   Do you?
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   Yeah, it didn't really work on me.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.100]   My iPad is pretty old.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.100]   I have an iPad II now.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.100]   Works fine.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.100]   Yeah, it works fine.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.100]   I mean, I'll stop at an Apple store and hold it though, because I'm curious.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.100]   Sure.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.100]   They're good at doing those videos.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.100]   And I think, I don't know, there's something so cute about Johnny I've talking about all
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.100]   the challenges they took on, like that works on me.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.100]   But yeah, no, I probably won't buy one.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.100]   I'm pretty embedded in the Androidverse though, so I'm not a good.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100]   I'm not a good.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.100]   Plenty of my friends who buy something would want a new iPad.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.100]   Right.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   What was the last Apple product that surprised you?
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.100]   You really have to think hard.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.100]   The Mac Pro is surprising.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   The new Mac Pro is surprising.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.100]   That is gorgeous.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.100]   And that is a 1% product, if ever.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.100]   There was one.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   Yeah, I mean, I never had one, so I wasn't invested in the Mac Pro getting better.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.100]   But yeah, that is one.
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.660]   It's pretty though, even if you weren't looking computer, even if you weren't a Mac Pro customer.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.660]   But that's still fashion.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.660]   Okay.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.180]   That's all it's fashion times 10.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.180]   Pure fashion.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.060]   All right, but apart from fact technology, what was the last in a technological sense,
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.100]   the last Apple product or announcement that's probably iPhone.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.900]   But no, the iPad.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900]   The iPad was a revolution.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900]   The iPad.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.900]   Okay.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.900]   That's 2010.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   Three years ago.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.900]   I remember being surprised by the MacBook Air.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:14.460]   And the Air is definitely still the best laptop out there.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.460]   Everybody, everybody in the Intel.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.700]   Everybody loves the Air.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.620]   So I've always been tempted by it, but I've never bought an Air because I'm not convinced
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.780]   that it can run Xcode and Eclipse and like all the things that I need for.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.420]   I'm not convinced that it's powerful.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.420]   It does.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.420]   It does.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.420]   Okay.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.420]   I love the air.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.420]   The earliest one wouldn't have Jamie.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.060]   No, in fact, a new air is great.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.100]   The new air would be a very good choice.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.420]   But the when they first launched the air and they showed somebody slipping it into a
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.820]   yellow envelope, a vanilla envelope that made an impression on me.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.820]   That was an incredible.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.140]   And I thought, you know, people made fun of it in our circles.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.220]   And that's the Paris Hilton.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.700]   No one wants such a little.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.700]   It's a great it's everybody loves it.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.100]   So that's function.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.460]   That's form follows function.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.060]   That's a functional improvement that happens to look great.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.660]   It was that before or after the iPad.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.780]   The first air was before the iPad.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.780]   For the iPad.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.340]   Yeah, but it's gotten better and better.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.500]   The iPad is the last one.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.820]   So the iPad be the last one.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.620]   Somebody in the chat room said, well, Apple Maps was pretty surprising to some people.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.660]   If you follow their directions.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.140]   Well, this is another area where Apple is definitely going after Google.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:35.020]   And I think maybe has eclipsed Google in some ways now with OS 10 Mavericks, which is free.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.900]   And that of course, that price point is aimed at Microsoft, not Google.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.580]   But we talked about this before the show began.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:46.940]   Apple and Microsoft in a way have a problem when they come up against Amazon and Google.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.340]   Because Amazon and Google can give away hardware or sell it close to cost because they make
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.340]   their money on the back end Google with advertising Amazon with sales.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.180]   And so that makes it hard to sell hardware because they're taking the profit out of the
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.420]   hardware.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.060]   So Apple has responded by giving away software and doing premium priced hardware.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.620]   And Microsoft has gotten out of the software business, has gotten into the hardware business.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.940]   I think looking at Apple saying, yeah, we better start making our own hardware.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.940]   That's why they bought Nokia.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.260]   That's why they're making Surface.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.260]   This is a big change for Microsoft.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.020]   Anyway, here's the here.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.180]   This is a OS 10 Mavericks, a free operating system.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.180]   Wow.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.940]   The Maps app is built into this.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.060]   This is an Apple Maps app.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:38.140]   But one of the things that's very cool is the new iOS calendar, not iOS, OS 10 calendar.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.860]   When you make an appointment, it will add a map link to it.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.020]   This is something Google doesn't do.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:48.020]   It'll also add travel time to the appointment, knowing the travel time from the maps.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.620]   And that's something I'd love to see in Google calendar.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:56.180]   So when I put a calendar item in, I'm never at the place I'm going to be going there
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.180]   from.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.060]   Well, it looks so what I don't know.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.220]   I haven't played with it.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.940]   But what they say is it looks at your previous appointment and your next appointment looks
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.780]   at the travel time and it and moves the next appointment up by the amount of time extra
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.420]   it's going to take to get there.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.660]   It says leave now.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   That's cool.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.980]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.500]   It's a Google Nowish feature.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.580]   And we actually talked about this during the Apple event that Apple would love to start
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.220]   doing some Google Now stuff, but they don't have the signals.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.020]   They don't collect the signals.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.020]   Exactly.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.020]   The signals of the business man.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.020]   Google's got all your search results.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.020]   And Amazon.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.020]   Or your email.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.020]   Yep.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.020]   Amazon can't do it either.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.020]   No, but they have some signal.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.460]   They have more signals than the Apple Amazon.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.500]   And commerce signals for sure.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.300]   Yes, which Google would die to have.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.220]   But Google now does do that.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.020]   It'll say, oh, it's going to take you 15 minutes to get to your point where you should leave
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020]   now.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.180]   Google Now is messing up this week.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.260]   I was down at a Google event.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.820]   I'll talk about it a little bit.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.180]   And I was I was got there early because I just got some work done in breakfast.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.180]   So I didn't go.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.620]   When I was there, Google said it's going to take you 37 minutes to get here.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.620]   Like Google.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.620]   Better than this.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.620]   And I was at a Google event.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.860]   Well, I don't know.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.860]   Google.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.860]   Google.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.860]   Google.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.420]   I just swipe away cards that are off.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.380]   But yeah, I've gotten anything you search for.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.620]   It'll say like, you know, I search for a restaurant in San Francisco.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.100]   You know, we drove down from Mountain View for dinner.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.700]   And then the next day it was like, we're doing three minutes to such and such.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.780]   It's like, it's breakfast.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.780]   I'm not going back there.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.780]   Right.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   You know, you know, that's fine.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   It's doing its best.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.780]   It's doing its best.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.620]   I don't want it to be too good.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.180]   It would be too creepy.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.180]   Right.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.420]   It's like you need to remind it needs this group every once in a while.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.820]   So you get a reminder that it's just a computer.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.820]   Oh, man.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.820]   Oh, phew.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.820]   Phew.
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.820]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:49.820]   Interesting.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.460]   So, so the one that gets me now is the new place.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.460]   Twenty five here.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.460]   It has right here.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.700]   Twenty five minutes to a new place.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.700]   Oh, God.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:59.700]   It's a place new.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.700]   The Golden Cross Bakery and Grill.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.700]   I go there now.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   You're nowhere.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:10.140]   Oh, they're making patties, which I don't I'm trying to like, where why is it doing
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.140]   this to me?
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.140]   I don't know.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.140]   I don't get it.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.140]   Google.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.260]   Do I care about this place?
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.260]   No.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.260]   Well, that happens to me all the time.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.700]   And that's exactly what you click, right?
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.500]   It says, do you want us to tell you more about this?
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.100]   And you say no, and he never bothers you again.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.260]   I know, but I don't see the logic of why I picked that.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.260]   Why did it start?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.100]   It's terribly random.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.380]   So there you go.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.900]   Apple has new iPads, Apple has new notebooks, Apple gives away operating systems and software.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:43.500]   I mean, I have to say Apple giving away the iWorks suite for anybody who buys new, any
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.140]   new Apple stuff is directly into Google Docs and Google Docs.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.540]   And they took great pains, even though they picked a very bad example to show how you
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:20:00.780]   can collaborate on iWorks Docs, which is a feature that Google Docs has had to itself
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.660]   up till now.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.860]   Google Docs has to get some more elegance.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.860]   It's not pretty.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.900]   No, it's not very useful.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.780]   And I find that I am so addicted now to the collaboration I was working on a grant proposal
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.380]   last week.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:19.860]   And then when the guy who had to set it off and had to get it Microsoft Word, it just
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.220]   took away all the collaboration.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.220]   It took away everything.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.700]   Shana, doesn't Office 365 do collaboration in the cloud?
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.380]   It doesn't have real time collaboration, does it?
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.380]   Doesn't.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.380]   I'm not sure.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.220]   I have to say, I agree that Google Docs need some jazzing up, but I spend a lot of time
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.220]   in it.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.380]   Did you watch the iCloud, the iWorks demonstration?
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.380]   Did that make you...
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.740]   So this is when they were making the album cover.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   I was watching in the whole...
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   The Bad Eddy Q album.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.660]   Boy, it was like Word Art from 1995.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.620]   Yeah, no, I mean, I was like, okay, like this is right, real time collaboration.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.060]   Like we've seen, I've watched things move on a page that my collaborator were moving.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.060]   Right.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   It didn't seem like the most mind-blowing thing in the world, but I was like, oh good.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.260]   Like, you know, Apple's getting better at services, right?
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.980]   That's what they need to get better at.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:11.980]   That's the thing that they generally are.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.340]   See, Alex Lindsey was sitting over here and then his company uses Google Docs for that
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.460]   collaboration feature primarily.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.140]   And he was very excited.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:26.020]   He said, oh, thank God, because I just suffering with a crappy, you know, look and feel of
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.020]   Google Docs.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.540]   Well, Google Docs doesn't have the visuals.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.540]   So that was...
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.540]   Right.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540]   What app was that?
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540]   Was it keen?
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.540]   It wasn't, you know...
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.540]   It was probably pages.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.540]   I don't remember.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.540]   It was pages, right?
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   So Google doesn't have an equivalent visual...
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.540]   Like...
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   No.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.300]   You know, thing that you would make a poster in.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.220]   So I get how that would be exciting for someone who's doing that sort of...
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.220]   That kind of design.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.220]   Right.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.220]   They have drawn...
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.220]   I never used pages.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.940]   Did you ever use pages?
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.940]   I never used pages.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.300]   I used Quark in the day.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.300]   I...
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.300]   There in lies the problem.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   You do the word.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.580]   Apple has, you know, a word processor pages.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.060]   It has a spreadsheet numbers.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.940]   It has a presentation manager keynote.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.340]   And they're still getting clotted by office.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.300]   And then on the other end, at the high end, and at the other end, they're getting
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.900]   clobbered by Google Docs.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.900]   I think I've used keynote.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.900]   I wish you'd...
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   Walks or twice.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   I think that's it.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.900]   I haven't used any other stuff.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.900]   So there you go.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.900]   Okay.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.900]   Never mind.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.020]   Well, no, that's a great test.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.020]   It did not...
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   It was aimed at you guys.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.820]   Because you both use the collaborative features of Google Docs.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.500]   And neither one of you, your ears, pricked up.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.860]   It just was like, you know, I don't think I'll ever want to do an album with eddy queue.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.660]   So I guess not.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.940]   I mean, there's also... if I were to use those, that software, I'd be assuming that my collaborator
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.260]   also has access to that software.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.140]   I don't have to worry about whether or not somebody has access to a web browser.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.300]   Well, no, no, that software works in a web browser.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.460]   You can do that in a web browser.
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.460]   Oh, that was all...
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.460]   That was in Safari.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.460]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.460]   Oh, that's totally totally...
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.140]   And it works in Chrome and it works on a Pixel.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.140]   It works on a Chromebook.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.300]   And it works on Chrome.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   Wow.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.500]   So, I mean, the Apple, the event livestream doesn't work in Chrome.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   No.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.500]   So...
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.500]   For odd reasons.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.140]   They have to have Safari to watch their live stream.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.140]   Is that weird?
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.260]   So I just assume that nothing works in... like not that many Apple, you know, web apps would
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.260]   work in Chrome.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.260]   So that's great.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.260]   That's cool.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.820]   I guess that's a little more exciting.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.820]   I totally missed that.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.540]   Yeah, they didn't make that clear.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.100]   Missed the boat.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.540]   And also, unfortunately, Apple has such a bad reputation for cloud services.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.540]   I clouded them before it mobile me.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   We're such abominations that I think people are burned and they're not even going to even
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.860]   think about it until they hear a hundred of their friends say, "Oh, no, it's really
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.860]   good now."
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:45.220]   Well, but again, so then I've got to, you know, some of my friends are on Windows machine,
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.100]   somewhere else, where the odds that they're going to think of an Apple service...
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.100]   Not going to happen.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.100]   Not going to happen.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   All right.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100]   All right.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.100]   Enough.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.100]   Let's know more talk about Apple.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.300]   Let us banish the thought from our mind.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.940]   Let's go back to the future.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:05.740]   Next, I'd celebrate that Google stock has now reached stratospheric proportions.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.860]   And I thought it would go down with profit taking.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.220]   It has not today...
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.220]   $1,031.44.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.020]   Up $24.45 today alone.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.780]   2.43%.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.460]   And all of this because of its quarterly results last week.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.460]   Boy, you beat this.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.460]   You're doing okay.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.460]   You beat the street.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.260]   You beat the street must be a masochist because when you beat the street, it kisses you back.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   Yes.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.540]   I went way too far on that one.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.100]   So I realize I'm skipping ahead, but so that their stock hits $1,000 for the first time
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.820]   and they're experimenting with giant banner ads and search results.
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.820]   Oh, dear.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.820]   I know I saw that.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.860]   So I'm playing that one to me.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.860]   I was waiting for Jeff.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.620]   I kind of want to Jeff too.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.620]   I know.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.900]   Well, you know, I actually have two reactions.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.900]   No, okay.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   Is there a search?
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.740]   Is there an organic search I can do that I'm going to see this?
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.740]   Do we know?
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.980]   No, it's a lot of brands.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.100]   So I'm going to search for staples.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.460]   It's one of their experiments that they're only running for certain users.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.460]   I know everybody will see it.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.940]   Yeah, I tried to stop the question.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.940]   I didn't see it.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.940]   You see it?
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.940]   I'm not seeing it.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.940]   No.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:12.940]   I have seen it.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.940]   Yes.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   And it's actually...
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.940]   I can't remember.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:16.940]   I actually hear...
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.940]   I'm going to get accused of being Google defender here.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.060]   It worked graphically, right?
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.460]   I was looking for this brand.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.740]   But what it did, Jeanette, was it made the Google search result feel more like the brand's
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.740]   page.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.780]   And don't forget, Google already has all these listings under the main results so I
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.300]   can go directly to things, the about us page or the by page or the this page or that page.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.420]   So now it felt more ready.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.940]   Look at this silliness that advertisers have done where it doesn't have staples, but it
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.820]   happens with other brands where you search on a brand, Luftonza, and there's the Luftonza
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.820]   listing first, of course.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.820]   That's what Google is doing.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.060]   And then the Google Luftonza bought the ad above it.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.060]   Never made any sense.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.820]   So let's say we're trying to stop Air France from buying it.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.220]   I'm not sure what, but it was a waste of money for the advertiser.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.180]   Now when it's the same brand, there you go.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.100]   So search for Southwest Airlines.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.180]   This doesn't bother me either.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.180]   I don't know why.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.180]   No.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.180]   That's a live search.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.180]   So you're getting it.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.180]   So you're getting it.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.180]   No, no.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.180]   This is from the search engine lens.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.180]   So I tried it.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.180]   I'm not getting it.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.180]   Here's why.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.180]   It's not a banner ad.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.180]   It's a branding position.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.780]   It looks a lot like a banner ad.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.260]   What's the difference between message and--
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.060]   What the hell's the difference between a banner ad and a branding position?
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.820]   What the hell are you talking about?
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.820]   It doesn't have a message.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.820]   It doesn't have a message.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.820]   It's a label.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.820]   It's a label.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.820]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.820]   Right?
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.300]   It's a sign over the store.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   And so it kind of-- I didn't look at it and say, "Oi!"
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.740]   No, it doesn't say try our $39 fare or anything.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.980]   It just says, "Southwest.com."
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.740]   It feels like Southwest Page.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.180]   And I can do my business within Southwest directly from there.
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.420]   Yeah, I don't mind this so much.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.220]   It does clearly say sponsored.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.660]   And you searched for Southwest Airlines.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.100]   If it did this-- if I searched for flights and it did this, I'd be mad.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.100]   Exactly.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.580]   And that's why it didn't seem out of place to me.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.580]   And I saw it happen.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.580]   I thought, whoa.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.580]   I was in the middle of going through something and I said, "Oh, I've got to remember that
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.580]   for Twig," which, of course, I didn't because I'm old.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.820]   But I saw that happen.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.020]   And I thought, "Oh, well, actually that kind of looked nice."
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.380]   And indeed, I was trying to go directly into whatever that brand stuff was.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.500]   So Google could justify it saying, "Well, we're just doing-- we're giving you what you--
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.700]   a better experience than what you asked for.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.700]   This is what you want."
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.380]   Yeah, and for the brand, it certainly is better.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.380]   Right.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.380]   That's what you asked us for.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.860]   But was it-- was it chatted?
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.500]   You find that quote from Marissa in the rundown?
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   Who did that good work?
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.580]   Yeah, that was-- that was actually-- so my co-founder, Anil, who constantly trolls me
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:55.380]   about being a Google fan girl, pulled up a blog post from 2005 off of by Marissa Meyer.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.260]   And in which she said, "There will be no banner ads on the Google homepage or web search results
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.260]   pages.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.140]   There will not be crazy, flashy, graphical do-dads flying and popping up all over the
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.420]   Google site, period, ever, period."
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.500]   Well, she should have written "Not on my watch."
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.900]   Not on my watch, right?
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.580]   Well, and of course, it will happen on her watch on Yahoo!
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.780]   She'll happily sell that.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.780]   Right.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.780]   Well, I mean, Yahoo!
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.780]   Yahoo!
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   Yahoo!
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   Yahoo!
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.780]   Yahoo!
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.220]   She has banner ads and crazy, graphical, flashy, you know, things do-dads flying all around.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.660]   So, you know, but she inherited that.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.100]   It was an interesting quote to pull out.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.900]   It does toe the line of banner ad.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.220]   And you know, when I was going back and forth with the New York's, we constantly have this
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.980]   debate, because he has the marketing guys' perspective.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   And I have like the coder guys, you know, coder kind of perspective.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.500]   And so I said to them all, "Can you imagine the marketing guy?"
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.340]   But they asked for the ad.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.020]   It's not evil, you know.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   And he said, "Yeah, and the coder said it's open because it's HTML5.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.420]   We were kind of looking for it."
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   Well, that's what that tweet meant.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.220]   I saw that go by between you and Neil there.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   I didn't understand the content.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.620]   Yeah, that's what he was saying.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.500]   Well, the question they should really be asking, and I'm sure that this is why it's still
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:14.940]   an experiment, is how does this impact the experience somebody has of Google?
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.820]   If suddenly you feel like, "I don't want a Google that looks like Yahoo."
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.820]   If suddenly you feel like you have to thread your way through Google results to figure
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.980]   out what's real and what's not, that's not a good experience and it's damaging to Google,
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.300]   regardless of whether it makes some money or even whether people complain.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.420]   You don't want to start communicating the experience that you can't be sure what you're
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.940]   looking at when you get a Google result.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.460]   And I'm sure that's what Marissa Meyer was thinking.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.500]   We want Google results to be pure.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.060]   So this is how, this is where, we talked about this last week, where do not evil came
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:50.860]   up, we do not want to be, what was it, go.com and put ad results in the search.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.780]   Fight type in the search results.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.860]   Fight type in Southwest Airlines in the ad request.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.620]   It does come up for me on my research results.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.620]   It does.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.580]   I get that, right?
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.940]   And so what I see on my first screen, as you see there, is Southwest Airlines, six links
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.620]   directly in Check Flight Status Schedules, Customer Service Special Offers, Book Award
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.180]   Travel Check in Online, right?
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.620]   Those are the links that I do indeed want from Southwest.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.620]   Well, it's always done that.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.340]   The only difference between that and what I'm getting is there's a picture.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.740]   But here's the funny thing, Leo.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.140]   It feels cleaner and better to me.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.860]   Because before what we'd have is that yellow Southwest ad on top, the two or three layers
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.460]   of that, all kinds of ugly Google text in it.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.660]   So it actually is prettier now.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.660]   I would argue.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.260]   Way larger.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.740]   Just super graphical way larger.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.860]   I know I'll get accused of being a fanboy for that, but I actually don't think it's a bad
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.860]   experience.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.660]   I mean, Google has been doing a lot of experiments with that upper band, like across, you know,
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.420]   with image search results and you got the knowledge graph down the right side.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.820]   I like the knowledge graph.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.500]   The knowledge graph is not an ad because while it tells me about Southwest Airlines, it also
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.100]   says people also search for American Airlines, Delta Airlines, US Airways, JetBlue and Frontier.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.100]   Well, here's the big deal.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.700]   There's no knowledge graph on my search.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.540]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.540]   That's not so cool then.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.380]   That's not so good because I did not, you're right.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.620]   Because this is useful in a non-adertizing way.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.620]   It's not a brand.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.620]   Right.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.620]   Yes.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.620]   If you go to look for eyes.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.620]   This is yo is when it was founded.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.860]   If you search for Verizon, it should, of course, say Verizon or Schmucks who won't attach Jeff
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.420]   Jarvis's Nexus 7 still.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.340]   But if it does not.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:35.300]   Well, remember why people type in, see, people use the Google search box in lieu of a URL.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   They type in--
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   It's navigation.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.660]   What's the number one search result on Google?
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.420]   Last time I was there was Yahoo.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.980]   Because instead of typing Yahoo.com, they type Yahoo and they know that first link they'll
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.180]   click it.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.900]   So I'm getting some of the in between what you guys get.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.900]   What do you get?
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.900]   And that's weird.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   There's no graph.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   Right.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   So you don't get this box.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   See this box that I have?
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.500]   It's almost like a card for Southwest Airlines.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   Right.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   And the knowledge graph is gone.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.860]   And the knowledge graph is gone.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.700]   The image that is showing up on search engine land has this box with the banner above it.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.940]   And you don't have a box at all.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.220]   And you get the knowledge graph.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.700]   That's because this is all an experiment.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.900]   And so they're trying different things.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.900]   And they're looking at pushback.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   A/B testing, right.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.900]   The A/B/C testing.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.900]   A/B/C testing.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.260]   A/B/C/D/EFG, probably.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   But I have--
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   But you're right, Leo.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.260]   That's the risk.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.220]   I was making fun of the Q-cat before the show and of this thing, which is URL space,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.460]   which you click buttons for links.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.020]   But that's what-- yeah, Google has become that.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.020]   It's the namespace.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.420]   It is the namespace.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.100]   You type it in at the top of-- it happened when you-- with the elimination of a separate
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.100]   search bar.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.100]   I would say--
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.100]   It's a monkey word.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.100]   A monkey word.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.220]   Yeah, most normal users don't type.com.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.420]   We trained them not to type HTTP colon slash slash.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.620]   Now they name it type.com.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.620]   They type the thing they're looking for, McDonald's.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.620]   And then--
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:03.940]   I'm surprised there isn't a-- I'm feeling lucky button in the universal bar.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.940]   So I would just go straight to McDonald's.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.940]   I guess Google doesn't want that.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.940]   Sometimes--
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.940]   Sometimes it's like me going to the--
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.540]   I mean, the programmer does not-- that sometimes not happen where you type something.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.540]   It actually takes it to that page or is that--
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.540]   I've not--
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.700]   It always-- see now, Timmy, OK.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.700]   So I type McDonald's.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.860]   This is the result I want from Google, which is a very nice combination of yes, links on
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.860]   the left.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.220]   But I've got a local map for the nearest McDonald's.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:31.620]   I've got the box on the right underneath that that gives me information in a non-partisan
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.620]   way.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.620]   People to look for King.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.620]   Yep.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.620]   I still get the McDonald's logo.
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:41.300]   And I think from the user's point of view, this is exactly the experience you want.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   I agree.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.700]   Filling that page-- taking that away and filling that page with a picture of Ronald McDonald
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.620]   would be a backward step.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.940]   But-- but-- but-- but-- McDonald's didn't buy that ad above the list.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.940]   That's right.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   Google made no money on this.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940]   Go to--
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.940]   Right.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.940]   Go to Verizon.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   Go to Verizon.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.940]   All right.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.780]   Nothing I want to give them any attention.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.780]   Ah.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.620]   So now I got the orange ad that you mentioned.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.900]   Now you have that-- that ugly ad above, right?
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.900]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.780]   I get the-- I get the-- the-- the-- the box and you don't.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.780]   So strange.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.780]   They're testing like crazy.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.780]   Now if you refresh--
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.420]   Possibly part of this problem is that Verizon is a couple of companies.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   So let me type Verizon wireless.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.420]   If you click on Verizon Wireless, you'll get the knowledge graph.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.420]   And this is--
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   Yeah, because it's a couple of companies.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.540]   So it's disambiguating it when I type wireless.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.740]   And this is-- I tell you from a point of view of a user, this is what I want.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.260]   I'm not-- I don't-- I can live with the ad because it's clearly an ad.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.740]   I wish it weren't so big.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.340]   And it's kind of a waste of space because it's the same-- by the way, when I search for
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:51.020]   something and then I see an ad and right below it as I am here, seeing an un-advertised
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   link.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.020]   Yeah, it does--
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.020]   If I want to screw Google, I click the ad.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:01.220]   Well, if I want to screw Verizon, I click the ad because I want Verizon to pay.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.220]   That's right.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.220]   Exactly.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.660]   The other way around.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:10.980]   If I want to screw Verizon, I click the ad because they have to pay for that now.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.580]   If I don't-- if I don't or I don't want Google to make any money, I click the native search
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.980]   link because nobody pays for that.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.460]   Why does that choice even exist?
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.460]   We're mature.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.100]   It's less than an S&H green stamp in cost, but still--
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.100]   Hey, if everybody--
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.100]   --told a way to vote.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.500]   That's how you vote.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:36.940]   I feel like they-- I mean, if Google didn't show Southwest.com as the top result and just
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.620]   the ad and then went to the rest of the results, then it would look really shady, right?
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.020]   They have to show that that would have been the top result anyway.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.020]   But the kind of--
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.020]   --the market has taken the knowledge graph out of that.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.780]   They're taking the knowledge graph out, which really bugs me.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.780]   Do we know that for sure, though?
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.780]   Do we-- does that screen shot?
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   That's what you're trying to sort of crop.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   On my page, yeah.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   Oh, on your page, see.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   On mine, it does.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.780]   Right.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.180]   That's how you're going to make a mistake.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.180]   I think I really am.
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   Do you think the advertiser--
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:17.540]   --
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:22.340]   --and it's happening here with Verizon, it gives you deep links into the Verizon page, which
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.900]   is very helpful.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   Yeah, yes.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.500]   Maybe you want to go to the front page and that link is there, but it maybe you want
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.940]   to contact them or find a store or choose a plan.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.180]   Those deep links are there as well.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.620]   That's very useful.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.740]   And that is like an ad.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.060]   So I think what Google's saying, well, we're already doing this.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:42.540]   If we put a picture there, what's the harm, except for the size of the--
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:49.340]   --of the brand's homepage, but it's a prospective search result that guesses where you're going
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.900]   to want to go there.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.900]   Right.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.460]   And I would imagine it gets more personalized as time goes on.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.140]   When you search for McDonald's, it--
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.340]   --presumed you want to know where the nearest McDonald's is, and it gives you a map.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.500]   Does paying for that banner picture--
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.860]   --what did you call it?
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   Brand.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.380]   Brand.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.500]   Does paying for that brand announcement give them the right to determine what deep links
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.140]   are there, then, beneath it?
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.260]   I better not.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:16.940]   It better not.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.740]   So that whole thing's not that unit, just the picture.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.740]   That should be the case.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.780]   Now, whether it is or not, I don't know, but that should be the case.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.180]   If that happens, then that is a violation of the founding principle of what do they say
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   on the Star Trek, of the prime directive, of Google, which is that advertisers cannot
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.260]   have an impact on search listings.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.260]   Full-stack.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.900]   I mean, because they're showing Southwest below that whole big, huge box with the image,
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.060]   that makes me think the same--
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.060]   The whole thing's odd.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.620]   --they are indeed buying that whole unit with all the deep links.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.100]   This really toes the line.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.420]   I think it crosses it.
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.220]   Well, no, Gita, toes the line means that it's OK.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   It's on the line.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.220]   It's certainly on the line.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.220]   It's not crossed there.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.220]   It crosses the line.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.260]   Now, what do you get--
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.260]   It pushes the line.
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.300]   --you're going to have to tell us, Jeff, because you're the guinea pig.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.300]   What do you get when you click the banner?
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   Good question.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.940]   OK, here we go.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.780]   I should get-- I go to the Southwest Home page.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.780]   That's it.
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.780]   Great.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.780]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:28.540]   If they took the white listings in their main directory and sold that--
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:34.140]   Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Gita, you may be right on the friggin' money,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:41.380]   because I'd now notice there is a box around the entirety of the sponsored bug picture
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.180]   and the--
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.180]   They're white.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.180]   There's a box around it.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.380]   Ooh, there's a thinnest, thinnest hairline rule you can imagine.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.820]   And then, is it going to show next time--
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.820]   If you had--
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:58.340]   Is it going to say, Gina Trippani likes Southwest Airlines?
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.340]   Right.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.060]   If I had less resolution than it might make a difference in pixel, I wouldn't even see.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   There is.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.140]   So it's included in a box, which traditionally means that sponsored applies to everything.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.140]   Ooh.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.140]   See the line?
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.140]   But--
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.140]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.140]   No, no, no, because that's a separate.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   The box, I think, has been there.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.140]   Has it?
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   OK.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.140]   All right.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.140]   I mean, I think--
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   No, I was saying with a card earlier, and you don't get the box.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.780]   This is what I was saying.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.220]   Each result seems completely different.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.140]   Now, I don't have a sponsored icon on my box.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.900]   These deep links I've seen on other search results.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.900]   Right.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   No, I get the same deep links.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.460]   Just don't get the box.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.460]   And I don't get the ad.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.460]   You got an ad?
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.460]   Is that an ad?
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.460]   No, no, no.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.460]   Well, yeah, I do get a related--
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.460]   You get an ad related to Southwest Airlines.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.140]   But I don't get the ad.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   Wow.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140]   Yeah, I get the box.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.820]   And Chad, what is that flight that you're getting in your knowledge graph?
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.820]   Is that a flight you've taken?
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.820]   That's an upcoming trip.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.820]   That's from San Francisco to Orlando.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.820]   OK, that's why you're getting something different.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.820]   You have Disney World.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.820]   Close.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:57.820]   That's going to Disney World.
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.820]   Minecon.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.820]   Minecraps.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.820]   It's the world for each.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.820]   It is.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.820]   Same thing.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.820]   Might as well be different.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.820]   But so that's interesting.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.580]   I think that he gets different results because he's got a flight book that he's even--
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.780]   It even says only you can see these results over in the corner.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.780]   So I don't know if you'd get the knowledge graph for him.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.780]   Except, of course, not your case.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   Isn't that my case?
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.580]   I'm just dreaming that I'm live.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.580]   Yes.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.580]   That's a Google now style.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.220]   That room says to search Delta.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.220]   So when if I sign out--
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.220]   All right, let me search for Delta.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.420]   Do I have to search for Delta Airlines or just Delta?
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.420]   I'm just trying to get the--
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.420]   Re-inventing aviation.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.140]   It's like it looks like it's an NPR rule where you can only say the tag line.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:39.340]   Now it says sponsored above and the rule goes around the entire thing including--
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.340]   So what do we vote?
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.460]   No, yay, nay, crossing the line under the line, over the line, behind the line, toe on the
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.460]   line.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.460]   Where is the line?
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.460]   To clear the line.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.460]   I don't even get an ad.
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   I don't like it.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.460]   Do you have any--
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.460]   I don't like it either.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.460]   I don't like it either.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.460]   I think you're crossing the line at the-- I hope it's just an experiment.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.860]   I never-- I never-- I'm going to agree with you.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:02.700]   If it was just selling that banner position-- that branding position above, I would be
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.700]   okay with it aesthetically.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700]   It actually looks okay.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:10.940]   But if they are selling what look like listings, that's violating the prime directive.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.780]   And I think it causes confusion as to what I'm looking at.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.780]   Am I looking at results?
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.660]   Am I looking at ads?
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.580]   I think Marissa nailed it.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.060]   Do not put ads in my search results.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.700]   No, I don't know whether-- what we're saying is true or not.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.700]   They may not be selling that.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.700]   They may not be.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.700]   But if the--
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   It says sponsored.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.700]   The advertiser has control over it.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.700]   It says sponsored.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.700]   Well, you don't know where the line ends.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.700]   Where the box ends.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   I don't know.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.700]   Well, even if it doesn't-- I don't like the big--
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.700]   Damn it.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.700]   --have to get a caveat there.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   But if they are selling whitelisting.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.700]   Oh, well, that would be bad.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.580]   But they're not-- but let's presume they're not doing that, Jeff.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.700]   Is it okay then if it's just a big picture?
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.820]   It was just a big picture I said earlier.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.820]   I'm not so bad with it.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   Plus, even if it--
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.060]   You described it to me, I would have had problems.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.900]   But given my consumer experience of wanting to go to something in South West Airlines,
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.700]   actually, it doesn't offend me.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.220]   Well, I'm concerned about the ethical issue.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.860]   And if you want Google to be worth more than $1,000 a share, then this is the kind of thing
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   you want.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.540]   And this is how you get third quarter results like Google got.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.300]   It was an amazing quarter, an increase of 12% over the third quarter of 2012 year over
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.220]   year.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.180]   An interesting point.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.860]   The click-through rate went down.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.180]   The click-through revenue went down.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:31.220]   But advertising revenue went up because they're selling a lot more ads.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:37.460]   Google, I mean, Wall Street was very impressed with Google's success.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:44.580]   $13.77 billion in revenue.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.420]   Just really a big quarter for Google.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.740]   And by the way, a lot of profit.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.940]   Google is not one of them, "Oh, we're making 5% on everything we sell."
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.180]   I don't know what the profit margin is, but it's big.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.900]   I can see if I can find that.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.900]   Net income was $3 billion.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.900]   Unbelievable.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.820]   And not to make money.
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.820]   Billion dollars a month.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.540]   So and that's how you make money.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.300]   Now, of course, Google also seems to have licked the mobile issue.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.380]   Everybody's worried, Facebook, and everybody else worried, "How do you make money in mobile?"
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.900]   Google seems to figure that out.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.180]   Their mobile ads have done well.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:30.540]   I'm sorry, I got the revenues wrong.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:36.580]   Revenues were $14.89 billion.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.700]   Google sites made $9.39 billion.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.860]   Google network revenue that's partner sites $3 billion.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:49.700]   $1.23 billion from other, I don't know how to read a balance sheet.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.540]   What would the other be?
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.620]   Other revenues from the Google segment.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.020]   I can't read this crap.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:04.500]   International revenues, $7.67 billion, 56% of their total revenue.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.660]   More than half the money they make is from outside the US.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.460]   Which is probably not taxed here, but that's a method of that.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.780]   No, that's the double Dutch Irish runaround.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.700]   Somebody said it in the chat room.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.700]   I know.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.180]   Double Dutch is Irish sandwich.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.180]   Irish sandwich.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.980]   Or no, double Irish Dutch sandwich.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.980]   That's it.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.980]   That's it.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:32.060]   We read before the show and I think this really nails this.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:37.980]   A judgement, an interesting judgement from Judge Learned Hand.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:45.780]   Back in 1947, IRS was suing somebody over just this kind of thing, being overly aggressive
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.660]   and avoiding taxes.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:53.180]   And I will read you this, I think, a salient quote from Judge Learned Hand.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:58.820]   He said in his judgement and commissioner versus Newman, 1947, "Over and over again,
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:04.580]   the courts have said there is nothing sinister and so arranging ones affairs as to keep taxes
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.100]   as low as possible.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:12.660]   Everybody does so rich and poor and all do right for nobody owes any duty to pay more
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.900]   tax than law demands.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.380]   Those are enforced extractions, not voluntary contributions.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.300]   To demand more in the name of morals is mere can't."
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:28.100]   So for those who criticize Google for taking advantage of the tax law, that's a pretty
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.780]   good response.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.780]   I think I just read today that it is, yes, it is the 100th anniversary of the income tax
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.500]   in the United States of America.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.500]   October 2013.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.500]   Wow.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.980]   So it's 1913.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.300]   And if you go to Newport, Rhode Island, you can see what happened before there was an income
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:53.260]   tax because the robber barons made so much money they could build very sigh-like palaces
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:58.620]   on the ocean front at Newport, Rhode Island because they got to keep everything.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.420]   Well for the first many years of the tax until World War II, I think the story also said only
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.060]   4% of Americans paid income tax.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.140]   Yeah, it was very wealthy.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.220]   That's where we've gone wrong.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:16.540]   The 20th Amendment, I just paid a lot of taxes.
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.540]   That's okay.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.100]   It's the price we pay to live in this far out.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.940]   You're such a good citizen before you were talking, I'll show you were talking about
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.780]   Steve, you're talking about doing your jury duty, your pain, your taxes.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:34.260]   I believe, well, yeah, and I know this is probably sounds stupid, but I think we have
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.740]   a social contract and that part of the deal.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.220]   You can just hand over all your phone calls to the NSA, huh?
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.220]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.020]   I'll talk to you about that another time.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:47.180]   I was talking to Steve about this, a very interesting piece by a security expert named
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.460]   Dan Geer in which he said, "Look, the NSA and the law enforcement is doing exactly what
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:58.860]   we wanted them to do because we said, perhaps not understanding the consequences, never again.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.580]   We said, secure us.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.340]   We said we don't want another 9/11 ever again."
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.060]   That's the Patriot Act, right?
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:12.940]   And the natural concept we imagined for those who understand how this stuff works is that
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.380]   you need total information awareness because the only way to say never again is to know
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.420]   everything that happens.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:23.740]   But that's the fallacy right there because Dianne Feinstein wrote an op-ed in USA Today
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:28.180]   extolling getting more dots, which of course is funny because USA Today has a dot logo
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.180]   now.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.980]   But anyway, going on about how you have more and more dots, and I'm going to do a Guardian
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.780]   event in two weeks where I'm going to interview former Senator Bob Kerry for a member of the
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.780]   9/11 Commission.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.140]   And the first question I want to ask is, because the 9/11 Commission said we have to connect
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.740]   more dots, does having more dots have any connection to connecting more dots?
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.740]   Yes.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.140]   So we're over with dots now.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.700]   We've got dots, dots coming out there.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.780]   We're crazy with dots.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.940]   And it becomes an information overload.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.460]   It's a pleasure to keep with it.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:01.580]   It's a filter failure problem now where you have too much information because you're not
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.980]   being focused because you get this ethos in the words of Keith Alexander to collect it
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.980]   all.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:11.980]   So now you have unbelievable amounts of data and you can't do anything with it because
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.180]   you haven't focused too much.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.180]   Did you need the right dots?
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.780]   I think you have an argument from the folks who are in the law enforcement agencies who
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.580]   believe they are in fact processing these dots effectively.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:27.140]   Well, a spy is going to try to get as much as possible.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:32.060]   More believe that, hey, look, I mean, look at Moore's law.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.300]   Let's collect it all now.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.580]   We'll have enough processing power soon.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.660]   Don't worry about that part.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.060]   That part we know is going to double every 18 months.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.500]   So just save it for later, later.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.620]   And they are applying some very sophisticated algorithms to this.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.700]   The other thing that Gear points out, which I think is true, is that the content is not
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   what's important.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.700]   The metadata is important.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   The relationships.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.780]   Who's talking to whom?
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.340]   That's really where all the value is.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:02.980]   And of course, you could never have enough metadata.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.980]   Dots.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.380]   That's a different kind of dot.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.380]   Oh, that game.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.820]   I am so addicted to that game.
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.500]   It's a good game, isn't it?
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.460]   We're talking about who wrote that.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.620]   That's a beta works, isn't it?
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.620]   Is it Lauren?
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.620]   Is it Lauren?
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.620]   No, I think it's beta works.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.620]   Beta works.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.740]   And it's on Android and it's just as addictive on Android as it is on iOS.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.140]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.220]   We're going to come back with the changelog.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.220]   See what Google's been up to.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.140]   Is there a changelog this week?
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.140]   There absolutely is.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.140]   I am ready.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.780]   There wasn't last week.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.300]   Google didn't do nothing.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.860]   It took the week off.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.740]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:50.580]   Sometimes in this life, when you're starting a business, starting a family, you need paperwork,
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.940]   legal paperwork.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.180]   It's the sensible thing to do.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.660]   But maybe you say, "I don't want to pay for a lawyer."
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.460]   You don't have to because LegalZoom can help you.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.420]   They're not a law firm.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:08.340]   They help you do the legal work you need to do under your specific direction.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.220]   For instance, starting a business, you'd be crazy not to get an LLC or an incorporation
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.220]   at LegalZoom.com.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.180]   Especially since it's only $99.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.180]   I brought the site down.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.140]   No, I just clicked too fast.
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:25.140]   This is $99.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.140]   Trademark.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:34.740]   As soon as I started Twitter, I immediately trademarked the Twit logo and the Twit name.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.820]   I think that's a really important thing to do.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.780]   $169 plus filing fees at LegalZoom.com.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   Sometimes it comes along and you say, "God, I really would like to ask an attorney to
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:44.780]   help me."
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.900]   They can do that too.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:51.540]   They have pre-negotiated fees, flat rate fees with attorneys in almost every state.
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.620]   You can get legal advice from an experienced attorney.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.140]   You can read their profile, read unedited reviews so you can pick the attorney that's
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.740]   right for you.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.220]   The rate is pre-negotiated.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.620]   You know how much it's going to cost from $11.99 a month to talk to a lawyer.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.460]   That is awesome.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.380]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.740]   It's great for the family.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:14.820]   Starting a family you need to last will and testament they can do that.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.380]   A piece of mine from $69.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.660]   Look at all the products and services LegalZoom offers.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.700]   It's really quite impressive.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:30.020]   All of this stuff really, trust me, you can do yourself with the help of LegalZoom.com.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.020]   You'll eat some property.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.020]   They've got real estate leases.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.020]   Deed transfers.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.180]   Other real estate documents.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.420]   You want to do a copyright.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.420]   They got it.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   Bankruptcy.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   Divorce.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   Immigration.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   Personal injury.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.420]   Name change.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.860]   Better butter cup.
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.620]   They can help you.
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:47.860]   They can help you do that.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:53.620]   $139 for a full legal name change or to change the name of a miner.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.820]   So here's the deal.
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.900]   Visit LegalZoom.com.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:00.140]   Make sure you use our offer code TWIG and the referral box.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.980]   You'll get $10 off at checkout.

[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.060]   Make sure you're telling me you heard about it on Twig.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:14.340]   Forbes said one of the best 10 best digital tools for entrepreneurs in 2012.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.940]   That's pretty good.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.420]   Pretty darn good.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.860]   Now ladies and gentlemen, play the trumpets.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.860]   Bring the bells.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.820]   It's time for the change log.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:32.580]   The Google change log.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.820]   Gina Trappani.
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:40.540]   Legal Hangouts for iOS got a massive update rendering lots of Android users really jealous
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.540]   and sad.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.300]   Hey, that's not right.
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.460]   It's not right.
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:49.620]   So the new Hangouts update for iOS gives the users the ability to call numbers directly
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:55.300]   from the app itself with no charge or any calls to the US and Canadian numbers and international
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.260]   calls work too for a fee.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.740]   If users have a Google account, Google Voice account, this is what I want.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.900]   This is what I want so bad.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:06.100]   It can both make and receive calls without going calls showing your Google Voice number
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.820]   and incoming calls popping up in the Hangouts app itself.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.860]   Also new, the visible indicators of who is reachable right now that recently popped up
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.860]   in Android version.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:19.220]   I've got inline animated GIF support, GIF or GIF.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.220]   I can't remember.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.220]   I can't remember.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.220]   GIF support.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.220]   GIF, GIF, GIF.
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.060]   We all fly in the face of the founder who says GIF.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   Right, not GIF, right.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.900]   It's a GIF, dammit.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.900]   And now incoming calls, don't stop the users' music that you're listening to on iOS.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.460]   It just pauses it.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:40.860]   So of course, Vikkindotra announced this on Google+ and a lot of Android users were very
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.340]   upset and Vik said, "Guys, don't worry.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.140]   We have massive investment in Android.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.780]   I promise you will be happy soon."
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:48.780]   This is my favorite part.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:52.220]   Don't get upset because we show some love to Google users who use iOS.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.420]   There are a lot of them and they are good people.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.420]   Of course, we like our iOS counterparts.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:05.380]   So waiting for that big Hangouts update for Android, very possible, a little drop of Kit
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.020]   Cat whenever the Nexus 5 comes out.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.020]   I'm waiting.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.460]   Which I think will probably be soon.
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.860]   As we said on "Alabadandroid" last night, it's perpetually a week away.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:21.620]   Well, October is a week and a day left, so it should happen soon.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:22.620]   It should happen soon.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:27.380]   You have a provocative promo for "Alabadandroid" about Nexus 5 conspiracy theories, Gina.
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.540]   What were those?
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   We talked about those.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.380]   Why they did...
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.460]   Yeah, we talked about that, didn't we?
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.460]   We did okay.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.460]   Right.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:41.660]   Whether this is like, yeah, hapless geek, sleeking, or purposeful marketing, uh, uh,
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.660]   employees.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.660]   Okay.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.260]   Google debuts parental controls for Chrome and Chromebook computers.
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.980]   They've got a new supervised users feature.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.340]   This is now on beta.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.660]   And this option is for parents and kids.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.780]   And a lot of kids are going to be using Chromebooks.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.780]   Are using Chromebooks.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.100]   And we'll probably continue to be using Chromebooks.
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:03.100]   This supervised user's feature allows a user, most likely, parent, to lock down the Chrome
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:08.020]   browser running on their device in order to allow and block access to certain websites,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:12.140]   enable safe search for filtering Google search results and maintain a history of the websites
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.900]   visited among a lot of things.
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:19.180]   So, um, I'm so excited that all this is going to be in place once Eddas old enough to be
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   surfing the web.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.260]   Those are the same features that are, that are educators can use.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.620]   Now they're just committing to parents.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:27.620]   I mean, I think, yes.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.620]   This is the same features.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.620]   This is in the beta builds.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:33.340]   And in fact, I don't know if you have, if have this Jeff on your, on your pixel yet,
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.620]   but yeah, I believe that this is the same, same strain of features.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.100]   And I think that this is exactly for that.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.700]   It's for Chrome in the classroom and for Clom and Chrome with, with kids.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:47.100]   If I made it up for a moment, which is what I do here, Chad, the last item under other,
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:52.700]   there's a picture there that I've found out is a Rorschach test for Luddites or geeks.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.540]   Oh, wait a moment for the picture to go off.
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.540]   That's all.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.540]   Look at it.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:57.540]   And yes, we'll look at it.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.540]   Let's see what we think.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:00.140]   What do you see happening in this picture?
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   You posted this.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.140]   I posted this, right?
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.780]   So it's a bunch of kids, a teacher in Texas or a tech administrator, Texas, put a picture
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.580]   up with a bunch of kids outside on a bench at the school.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.780]   It's recess and the majority of them.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.780]   Well, it's something.
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.700]   The majority of them are on laptops.
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.420]   This is a one for one Chromebook district.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.900]   The reaction was fascinating because people came on and a lot of me said, they should
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.900]   be throwing frisbees.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:24.900]   They should be doing this.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.180]   They should be talking to people.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.380]   And I said, remember, they probably are talking to people.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.860]   They're just talking, you know, and somebody else said, yeah, they're not talking to the
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.860]   doofus.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:32.860]   They said next to them.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.860]   They're talking to somebody better.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.900]   And the reactions were just polarized as hell.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:38.900]   This is sad.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.900]   This is creepy.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.900]   Oh, this is great.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.900]   Really?
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:42.900]   People thought that was creepy?
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.460]   That did not strike the use of creepy.
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.580]   Yes, sad, creepy, social misfits, all that, all that neem, you'd hear.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:56.020]   Clamp says they're waiting for the Apple store to open.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.340]   The line goes round the school.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:02.980]   No, and some of them are on the football team.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.980]   You see, they're wearing their jersey, so they're getting exercise.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:12.100]   Unless the football team is like, you know, on a Chromebook.
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.100]   That could be their chest jerseys.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.100]   I don't know.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.100]   It's a chest team.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:19.140]   My reaction is like, oh, I'm so glad they're getting outside while they're using their
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.140]   computers.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.940]   Yeah, I have to.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.980]   You know, I've seen this exact thing so many times it didn't even, I didn't even think
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:26.980]   anything negative.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.940]   It just looks normal to me.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:29.940]   But oh my gosh.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:33.100]   My kids went to a one to one high school and that's what you see.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.460]   And they still are active.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.500]   They still play frisbee and stuff.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:42.260]   I will say that there are days when I regret that the physicality of like the work that
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:46.740]   we do involves sort of being hunched over, you know, hunched over a computer.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.420]   I mean, I think this is what glass is about, right?
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.740]   It's like not having everyone sort of.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:55.780]   And I get glasses imperfect and whatever, but I can sort of understand the reaction a
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:56.780]   little bit.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:58.980]   But my reaction was definitely I'm glad they're using computers outside.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.940]   Hey, it's better than getting some bully throwing a dodge ball at you at a hundred miles
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:03.940]   an hour.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.940]   That's for sure.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.940]   Right?
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:06.940]   That's dang nice.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:07.940]   I like that.
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:08.940]   I like that.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.940]   I like that.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.940]   I like that.
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:11.940]   I like that.
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:12.940]   I like that.
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:13.940]   You know, experience the, oh, yes.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:14.940]   I wish I had had Chromebooks when I was growing up.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.980]   Well, that was the interesting thing too.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.540]   People in this, people who are, you know, they're 20 said, oh, I so wish I had laptops
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.300]   then because I, you know, I just went off and looked at anti-social in some other way.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.460]   I didn't know what I was doing this, but I didn't have anything on my lap.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.940]   I locked myself in a computer lab in college most of the time.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.940]   Did you?
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.940]   Wow.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.940]   There you go.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.940]   In high school, it was an opus, you know, spiral notebook.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.940]   Right.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:36.940]   But yeah.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.940]   Were you drawing or writing?
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:38.940]   Uh, in high school?
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.940]   Yeah, writing mostly.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:40.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.940]   Um, all right.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.940]   Let's get back to the change log.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.380]   This is from the, no, no, that's okay.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.900]   From the like, it's really cool.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:52.220]   It can do this, but I don't know when I'd ever use this category.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:58.140]   Google brings mouse and trackpad handwriting support to Gmail in over 50 languages and
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.980]   docs and over 20 languages.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:07.940]   So you basically, if you want to draw, literally draw, uh, characters on your trackpad in very
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:12.780]   many languages, you can enable input tools and Gmail or docs.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.980]   You have to go into settings, general, enable input tools.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.340]   And then you've got this little button that says, Hey, turn on handwriting support and
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.740]   you can draw characters in many, many, many languages, 50 in Gmail and docs in 20 and
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:28.540]   um, transcribe and it will get entered into your document.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:34.260]   This is, this is most useful for non-rummer and uh, uh, languages or, or uh, ideographic
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.620]   languages like Chinese.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.620]   Yes.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:40.620]   Where they really, that would be so much better than trying to use a keyboard.
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:41.620]   That's true.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.620]   Yep.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.620]   Yep.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.620]   That's the use for it.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.620]   Absolutely.
[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.500]   And finally, Google plus, uh, discontinuing saved search.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.100]   They used to be able to search, uh, save a search for a keyword.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.860]   Now Google saying, Hey, this is, uh, this is going away.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.660]   If you want to save a search, just bookmark, bookmark the page to the search results.
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:02.260]   So they thought that was going to take over the world and that we were all going to have
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.180]   tons of saved searches and it was going to be this great thing.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.580]   And that's the great, you know, Google learns though.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.580]   Nobody wants it.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.580]   Okay.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.580]   Goodbye.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.580]   Clearly nobody was using it.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.580]   Well, not nobody, but if you were the 1% that used it, now you're, you can't.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.380]   You got a lot of reading reader.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.460]   Is it that hard though to maintain a saved search?
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.580]   I mean, it seems like unless absolutely nobody used it.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.740]   I mean, really nobody used it.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.940]   I think it was, it was a problem was it was another feature.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.940]   It should have been a follow.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:32.940]   Follow a person.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.940]   I should have been able to follow a search.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:39.020]   They already had that grammar there and they tried to make up a new world and that's
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.340]   to me the mistake.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:46.260]   I mean, if, and if they had a decent API, people could make clients that would save searches
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.380]   for them, you know, like that there's always this tension with the like, well, 1% uses
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.380]   this 99% doesn't.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.380]   So we need to take the buttons.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380]   We need to take it out.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.980]   And there's always going to be that, but you know, if you had a decent API, then people
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.140]   could make power apps that did those things.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.500]   Even in the chat room says, I'm sure Elgin used it.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.020]   I'm sure that Elgin did use it.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.820]   I used it when it first, when it first came out and then I never used it again.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   Yeah, I forgot.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.820]   Yeah, forgot about it.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.820]   I forgot to look at them.
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:14.820]   I want you to say something.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.460]   That's all I got for the changelog.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:25.220]   And that's the Google changelog.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:33.940]   Do you love the, do you love this use of Google's auto complete in this campaign?
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.980]   I saw somebody linked, I saw somebody linked to this and I thought that's only going to
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.540]   upset me and I didn't look at it.
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   It is.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.540]   It's upsetting.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.540]   These aren't real though.
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:44.540]   These are edited.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.540]   These are not the actual auto.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540]   Yeah, that's the problem that bothered me.
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.540]   I made the reference to that.
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:48.540]   It'd be edited.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.420]   I think that makes us all look bad because if you, I went to everyone of those searches
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.620]   and I looked at them and yes, half of them were, were yucky and made me feel bad, but
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.660]   the other half made me feel fine.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.660]   Right.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:05.460]   And so it's a bit of a falsehood, I think, to try to take it and only give us the bad
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.460]   of us.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.460]   Right.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.460]   So, so if I understand correctly, the premise is that these are Google suggests auto complete
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:18.060]   phrases for things, or women shouldn't dot dot dot.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.540]   Women should dot dot dot.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.540]   Yeah, that's, I don't think that that's a good measure.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:27.180]   If they're fake, and if they're fake, which they were, they take some of the power.
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.540]   I have to say that bad attitudes don't exist, but.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.540]   Well, they definitely do.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.820]   That's a little, that seems a little sensationalistic to me.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.700]   I just typed women shouldn't and I got women shouldn't work.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.420]   Women shouldn't be in combat.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.420]   Women shouldn't be cops.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.420]   Women shouldn't vote.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.060]   Women shouldn't go to college.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.060]   That's pretty bad.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.060]   Oh geez.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.060]   That's bad.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.660]   But that's just like we've googled ourselves on the show.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.860]   You'd put in your name and of course, it's like divorce.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.660]   I know, I get the worst stuff, right?
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.140]   Yeah, like it's all the bad stuff, right?
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.620]   Women should not be in combat.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.020]   Women should be in combat.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.660]   Women should not preach.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.980]   Women should not speak in church.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.780]   Women should be seen and not heard.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   Wow.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.780]   Oh, God.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.780]   You know what, maybe it wasn't so faked.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.780]   Oh, those are your actual.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   These are actual.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.820]   This is not from the posters.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:17.060]   Well, you know what, Leo, I swear this has changed since when I looked at it before the
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.820]   show, some hours ago.
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.420]   Because now it is definitely more negative.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.380]   You're right, but it wasn't.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.780]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.700]   It feels like that or that article is encouraging people to search for those things, which is
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.940]   just ranking them higher.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.380]   So it's like it's just like it's the smart.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.780]   You know what?
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.700]   Men or men should not do auto complete to figure out stuff.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.700]   Yes.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.700]   All right.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.260]   Women or men should not use auto complete.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.980]   Now, what do you get when you type men shouldn't men shouldn't wear shorts, shouldn't wear flip
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.380]   flops.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:50.420]   Men shouldn't marry men shouldn't hit women.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   There's a good one.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.220]   Men shouldn't wear jewelry.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.060]   What's with the men in shorts thing?
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   I don't get it.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.060]   There's like this.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   I agree.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   I don't want to see your niece.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.060]   I agree.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:06.940]   I think the men shouldn't wear flip flops seems to be a very strong current.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.780]   It's like number one.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   I don't know why that is.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.780]   I like a good manly flip flop.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.780]   I don't want our problem.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   I don't want our problem.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.980]   Flops like as Harry toes, you know.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.980]   Geeks love to wear shorts.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.980]   So you know, short title.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.980]   Sorry.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980]   Mary does.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.980]   Sorry.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.980]   Harry does.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.980]   Yep.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:32.780]   Point of the ad is important that there is far more misogyny than--
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:35.180]   All you have to do is do that auto complete right there.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.180]   Oh, well said.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.180]   Men and women.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.540]   It's kind of a difference.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.860]   Tesla's going to add chrome as well as an Android emulator.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.620]   What is that to its big screen?
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.620]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.620]   Seems like such a bad idea.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.260]   One of the reasons I didn't get a Tesla is I knew I would be distracted by that 17 inch
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.260]   display.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.260]   I know.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.300]   It looks like too much fun.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:02.020]   They're going to add chrome and third party apps to their Model S vehicles by the end of
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:07.020]   the year according to Elon Musk.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:11.220]   And they're considering adding an Android emulator to the car so you can literally run
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.980]   an Android program in a window on the car.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.220]   I have to see how that works out.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.220]   OK.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.180]   They also chose, I think, AT&T for their LTE access.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.460]   So it's a good thing because if it was Verizon, I'd never buy a Tesla.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.460]   Well, why not?
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.700]   Still nothing on your X7, huh?
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:39.020]   Not a thing.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:44.540]   Netflix had a good quarter proving its strategies correct.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:49.780]   It crossed 30 million subscribers making it bigger than HBO.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:55.140]   31 million subscribers, nine million in the rest of the world, total of 40 million people
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:00.780]   paying $7.99 a month for Netflix streaming.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:05.260]   Stock market loved that.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.500]   And of course, some real successes in their Netflix original productions.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:14.860]   They just did a deal with Sony Motion Pictures, the first major movie studio to do a deal.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.420]   You watched Orange is the New Black.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.420]   Love that.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.420]   Oh, God.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.420]   It was such a great show.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   It's such a great show.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.660]   Doing very well, by the way.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.540]   It's bigger than I think any other Netflix show so far.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.020]   Really more than the House of Cards, huh?
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.180]   I think I saw something about the fact that, yeah, which I mean.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.780]   And it didn't seem like it got the marketing that House of Cards got.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.140]   No, it was such a great show.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.700]   You know, women in prison, you can't go wrong, really.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.060]   Yes, you can't be.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.060]   Women should order prison.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.060]   We can watch them.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.940]   The premise of the show, it's a true story.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:51.820]   The premise of it is that a white, well-educated, I think she went to Smith, right, or somewhere
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:55.860]   a middle-class woman goes to federal or a state prison.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:56.860]   I can't remember.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.980]   For a crime she committed in her youth like eight years ago.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.900]   And the book is her memoir.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.980]   She has mule and money.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:12.460]   What's interesting about it is, yeah, mule and money for her girlfriend, drug lord.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:19.980]   What's interesting about it is that each episode kind of highlights these other women in prison.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.100]   The stories are fascinating.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.100]   So it's kind of fun.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:27.900]   It's one of the only shows, I guess I shouldn't say on TV, it's not on TV.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:34.700]   One of the only shows where all the character, you know, the whole story focuses around women
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.180]   and their relationship primarily with other women.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.780]   Like the one major male character is sort of this like doofy guy.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.780]   Cornstache.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:43.540]   Oh, and cornstache, right.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:47.420]   I mean, it's extremely feminist.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:48.420]   It's just incredible.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:53.100]   Like it's so good to see protagonist and to see women presented as people who have problems
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.900]   beyond their like trying to get a boy's end.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   What is that?
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:02.140]   That they're all criminals are in prison, which is not going to be the best.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.780]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:09.260]   What is that test that you do if there are female characters that doesn't talk about men
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.260]   or?
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.260]   Yes.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.260]   I don't remember that.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.340]   You know what's surprisingly good?
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:22.620]   I thought it would just be given its network showtime and its title, Masters of Sex.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:25.460]   I thought it would just be a lot of nudity.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.460]   It's not good.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.140]   It's surprisingly good and it's surprisingly feminist because what it really is about is
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.540]   the repressive roles that women had to take in the 50s.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540]   Right.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.540]   It's a Masters of Johnson.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.580]   I heard it was sort of mad men with nudity though.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.580]   It's better than that.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.580]   A lot of nudity.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.580]   It's a bit of a nudity.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:42.580]   It's about sex.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.580]   What do you expect?
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.580]   But it is.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.420]   It's the prequel to mad men.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:50.340]   Because mad men starts where Masters of Sex leaves off.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:55.260]   And so mad men is all about the kind of unfolding of the 60s and liberation.
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.140]   This is about how repressive the 50s were.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.700]   God, I forgot how bad it was.
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.700]   Cool.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.700]   I'll have to check it out.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:03.700]   I'll check it out.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.580]   I was saying to a friend of mine, I was like, I love orange is the new black because it's
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.060]   like, there's so many like kind of realistic relationships, especially lesbian relationships.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.660]   He's like, Gina there in prison.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.660]   I was like, no.
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.660]   It's not real choice.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:16.300]   But to be fair, there's a lot of nudity in that show too.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.300]   And a lot of sex.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.300]   There is.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:25.260]   Now, how's the cards to me is the better of the three because it's really it's about
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.900]   the amazing manipulations that go on politics.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:28.900]   And I think it's quite good.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.980]   And boy, Kevin Spacey is brilliant in it.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.980]   They're all three good.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   And I think Bravo Netflix.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   I mean, really, I think this is great.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.780]   They hit it out of it.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.580]   This has been Chromecast for me too.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.420]   My Nexus 7.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.460]   I won't make a Verizon joke.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:45.460]   I watched shows.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.140]   I'm spending a fortune watching shows.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.580]   Orphan Black, did you watch that?
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.740]   Yeah, I started that.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.740]   It's interesting.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.740]   It's good.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.380]   It gets even better.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.380]   I like it.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.380]   No, I like it.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.380]   It's interesting.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.260]   It's a little sometimes when shows are really nerve-wracking.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:04.300]   I don't want to watch them because I like my stomachs in a knot.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.620]   And it's a stomach in a knot show.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.220]   The vegetable test.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.220]   Sorry.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.220]   Thank you, Fu, in the chat room.
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.220]   The vegetable test.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.220]   The BCHDEL.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:16.660]   Yeah, named after Allison Batchill, who's an incredible cartoonist.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.420]   Yeah, she's the one who came up with the test.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:23.900]   Is there a character in the story who is a woman who's, you know, doesn't, who's, you
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.660]   know, story doesn't revolve around?
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:30.220]   It says the test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.540]   other about something other than a man.
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.340]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.340]   Period.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:40.860]   And you'd be amazed at how many movies fail that test.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.860]   Like most.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.860]   Mm-hmm.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:44.860]   All right.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:48.860]   Thank you for my feminist soapboxing of the episode.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.140]   No, we're all with you.
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.140]   Right on.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.500]   You've come a long way, baby.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.500]   Now you can smoke cigarettes.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.500]   I don't.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:02.340]   No matter what Google obviously just says, I can smoke cigarettes.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.940]   And I don't know if I want to go into this, but it's when I read the headline, I thought
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.700]   it was kind of creepy Facebook and beheading videos.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.620]   I did an interview on BBC about this today.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:16.860]   I don't, this could, by the way, I should warn people that what you were about to talk
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.060]   to it could be very triggering.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.540]   And if you're at all sensitive to stuff, stop now.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.220]   But I do not want to go into any detail on it.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220]   We're not going to show anything.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220]   Go on.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   Go on.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.220]   There are highly offensive videos.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:34.100]   Um, highly offensive videos and Facebook's argument in a free speech vein was that as
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:39.660]   long as people were putting them up to criticize them, to condemn them, that it was okay.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:44.940]   The argument then came back, well, you then why don't you allow nursing mothers naked
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.260]   breasts?
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.220]   Um, and because we're not condemning nursing.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:52.140]   Well, no, that's not right.
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:58.900]   Then even David Cameron, uh, Prime Minister of the UK condemned the Facebook's action.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.740]   So Facebook pretty much backed off, took that video down, but still left the open door to
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.900]   say that, uh, something's going to be put up.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:12.340]   And I, you know, I, there was a very good column by a columnist in the, in the Guardian, this
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.300]   one, they chose to edit anything.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:18.380]   Then they do have a necessity to make a standard and, and say what that standard is.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.780]   Now, at the same time as a news person, uh, you know, I don't want somebody to come to
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.980]   the news and say, you can't show anything that's going to offend anyone.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.820]   It's going to be disgusting.
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.820]   You don't want that.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.060]   But I think you do have to ask, where's the harm here and the harm of showing these horrible
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.060]   things?
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.060]   Because you're right.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.060]   It's bigger.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.060]   There's genuine harm in this.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.060]   This is no one should see this.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.060]   You can condemn this without showing it.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.060]   So I agree.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:43.080]   So I, in the end, I agree it should not be there, though I understand the argument of
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.340]   principle isn't as simple as it seems.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   It's difficult.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.340]   You know what?
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:53.340]   It really comes down to this notion of is a, uh, internet provider, a common carrier,
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:58.100]   and like the phone company, whether or not responsible for anything, exactly, or if they
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.980]   are responsible for anything at all, then they're responsible for everything.
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:02.980]   There's no middle ground.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:06.740]   The Reddit creep shots, you know, there is a middle ground.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.740]   Is there a middle ground?
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.860]   Yeah, but there's, there's a middle ground.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.420]   Sure there's a middle ground because, because Facebook can say we're a place where friends
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.180]   get together to meet and have a nice time.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.180]   Right.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.860]   And yes, dissidents can use it to show war and show bad things that happen in war.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.500]   Um, you know, if, if Facebook started taking down all the pictures that came from people
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.140]   being killed in Syria, they'd be smashed for that.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.140]   And that's disgusting.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.540]   That's dead children for God's sake.
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.980]   There's nothing more disgusting than that.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.980]   There's reason.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.980]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:33.980]   But the care for a purpose.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.780]   I guess it's just, it's hard to come to an agreement about what's okay and what's not
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.780]   okay.
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.260]   But I guess it's worth doing it.
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.260]   Exactly.
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.620]   So Facebook and Google try to avoid that.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.940]   They try to say we don't want to, we want to become a carrier.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.340]   We don't want to do anything, not for legal reasons, but just for the hassle and the expense
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   reasons.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:50.340]   They can't do.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.340]   Technically.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:14:00.500]   But they do have, they do have some, I think they have a right responsibility and somewhat
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.180]   of an obligation to have a decent environment.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.420]   I mean, I learned this about trolls and comments.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.820]   If you don't kill the, if you want the trolls to take it all over, then they will take over
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:10.820]   everything.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.820]   That's right.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.780]   So at some point you have responsibility for helping the community because you have the
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780]   authority, right?
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:16.780]   You are the one who can kill it.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.780]   Nobody else can.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:22.340]   But the other thing I said too is it's not as if maybe she tried to say, well, just,
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:25.020]   you know, advertisers got to run away from Facebook and it's going to affect their market.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:30.900]   I said, no, you know, Zuckerberg said long ago that no two people in the world see the
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.980]   same Facebook.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:36.620]   The number of people who see this crap is limited.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.740]   And I think we, you know, we don't want to over blow it and perhaps give it too much
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:41.740]   attention.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.740]   Okay.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.740]   Moving on.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:48.660]   Uh, should we talk about this Android piece?
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.300]   Yeah, you want to, could you talk about it last night?
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.780]   I wanted to know your, your views on that brought over to this show from last night's
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   show, Jamie.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.780]   Yeah, we did talk about it last night.
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:14:59.780]   So I apologize.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.780]   Anyone who watched all the way.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.780]   No, no, but it's very important.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:07.580]   So we're on Amadio's piece on our technical, Google's iron grip grip on Android controlling
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.380]   open source by any means necessary.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.580]   And we actually had Ron, the author of the article on all about Android last night.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:17.060]   So, um, and we really got kind of got into it, uh, with him, it was a really good, good
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.060]   conversation.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:22.460]   Uh, I mean, you know, the, the summary of his article is basically that, you know, every
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:29.860]   time Google releases a proprietary Google app, like Gmail or like Hangouts or like Google
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:34.420]   photos, which we're going to see in KitKat that the open source version, just the generic
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:40.660]   gallery app, the generic messaging app, generic email app, basically becomes abandoned where,
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:45.340]   um, that Google stops updating that, you know, even though Android is open source, we all
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.740]   know that Google works on it in private, you know, behind closed doors.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.180]   And then when they do a release, they release the source out into the public, right?
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:57.220]   So it's not a thing that's happening, you know, in public nightly and they're not accepting
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.020]   contributions from anyone else.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:02.660]   Um, so this article is basically saying that, you know, that Android in a lot of ways.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:06.540]   And this is actually, I think one of the best arguments I've ever seen for Android not really
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:12.580]   being open, um, that, um, you know, that, that Google is, is, it lets all, you know,
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:18.220]   turns all the, the open source Android apps into abandoned where and replaces them with
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:22.940]   their own proprietary versions, which are closed source and which only run on Google
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.820]   experience phones, right?
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:30.140]   And there are restrictions that Google, the company puts in place for a manufacturer to,
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:36.260]   to, to, um, satisfy all the requirements that let them run all the Google proprietary apps,
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:39.340]   which is the Play Store and Maps and Gmail and all that.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:43.180]   Um, you know, they have to make some agreements and, you know, some of those are backdoor
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:45.940]   agreements that aren't public and we're not really sure what they are.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.980]   Ron did a really good job.
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:51.180]   Um, he was saying that the open handset alliance based on information that we've gotten from,
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.300]   you know, court cases and other snippets here and there.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:59.460]   It sounds as if Google has made at every manufacturer in the open handset alliance, basically promised
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:03.820]   to not distribute devices unless their Google experience Android.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:09.180]   So, so in essence, Google is locking out other companies from being able to fork Android,
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.700]   you know, with the exception of course of Amazon and we're seeing things like Sanogen
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:17.940]   mod now, um, to fork Android and to make the Google's doing everything it can to make it
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.860]   as difficult as possible for any other company to fork Android and to make, make their own
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:27.540]   custom Android build that can compete with Android that Android's value is the proprietary
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:32.500]   closed source layer of Google apps versus the open source code.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.380]   So it's, you know, it's a great read.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:39.300]   It's something I, um, it's the first time that I've been fully that I've actually been
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.020]   sway, you know, I hate these arguments.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.020]   Is Android really open?
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.860]   I've always sort of dismissed those, right?
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.940]   But this is the first time that I was like, oh, this is, this is really interesting.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.340]   I mean, I think that that Google now that Google has dominant market share, they really
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:54.780]   are going out of their way to make it difficult for anyone else to catch up to them.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:18:00.300]   So you would contrast it to somebody like, let's say Ubuntu, which takes Linux, doesn't
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:05.500]   fork it, but enhances it, puts everything back into the open source repository and all
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:11.260]   the changes that are made, I believe on Ubuntu are done in public as opposed to behind closed
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.260]   doors.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:13.260]   That's right.
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.660]   So that would be the other way to handle it.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:16.660]   Right.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.780]   I mean, the, the, the, the proprietary Google apps, like take example for Hangouts or Google
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:27.020]   Play music, they're so deeply and closely knitted into Google's web services, um, or
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.220]   Google now, for example, the Google search app, the, the open source one hasn't been
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.220]   updated in a really long time.
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:34.740]   It looks really old, but Google now is the new version, you know, that they, that they,
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:39.420]   that they haven't open source those because that's, that's, they're so closely tied with
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.060]   their services, their cloud services meaning.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:49.340]   Um, so it feels like it's time for Google to start letting in third party collaborators
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:56.340]   who will update the core generic non Google web service specific apps, uh, you know, like
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.540]   messaging and like email and like Google search, you know, just the search bar, um, to kind
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:05.420]   of keep those up today because most because those are kind of those are abandoned ware.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:11.420]   So this spawns companies like Samsung who, you know, write all their own proprietary apps,
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.420]   right?
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.180]   To, to replace the Google version.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:16.860]   The thing is that they're never going to be as good as the Google version.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.860]   They're not as good.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:21.420]   Um, because Google had a head start because Google is an incredible web services company.
[01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:25.620]   I mean, I mean, it's clear that, that Android Android from day one, we knew was it was a
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.940]   platform for Google services, right?
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.780]   But it just seems like they're being, um, much more of a bully and much more protective
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.220]   and defensive of their turf.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:38.740]   You know, now that Android has, you know, achieved the dominant mark position that, that
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:39.740]   it has.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:40.740]   I know.
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:45.060]   It doesn't, it's not necessarily a negative.
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:52.060]   I mean, there is an open version of Android and then it's completely, it's not inappropriate
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:57.540]   for Google to make a closed version of Android, but it, it just shouldn't call it an open.
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.980]   I mean, there, this is the thing, right?
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:03.340]   Like their closed apps are apps on top of the open layer, right?
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.540]   So they're not like actually taking Apple does that with Apple does that with Darwin.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.980]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:11.580]   I've got, I've got, I've got no problem with that whatsoever.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:12.860]   I mean, everybody, everybody can build out.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.100]   Just don't call it open source because it's not.
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:19.820]   Well, it's the, it's the leaving the apps, the original apps, the open source version,
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:26.580]   you know, on not updated, concentrating all of their effort into the proprietary closed
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:31.220]   layer that lives on top of the open layer and then saying, Hey, Android, open source.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.860]   And we've got apps that haven't been touched in Apple will say we're built on open source
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860]   software.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:40.860]   We can build open source, we contribute stuff back to the Darwin project, but, but the
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:45.300]   some of always tend is much more than Darwin, just as the sum of a Google experience phone
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.780]   is much more than Android.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.780]   Right.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.780]   Right.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.380]   But then so they should say that there is a dot com, huh?
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.620]   Or WordPress dot com.
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:57.580]   And I'm reckoning with this would think of, you know, we're going to have our proprietary
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.860]   system in layer and like this is the thing when you build a business on open source,
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.820]   you generally don't open source the business value, right?
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.300]   Like the business value for, for, for, for Google is that people are running the play store
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:10.140]   and purchasing them things there and running Google now and using Google services and
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.340]   making Google part of their lives.
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:17.580]   Somebody else who forks, you know, forks, Android, whether it's, you know, Sanjan, me
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.820]   why Amazon is the classic Amazon is the clear case.
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.020]   Gdell is the question though, devil's advocate moment here.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:29.220]   The question is, what's Google protecting besides the business interest in terms of
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:30.220]   brand?
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:35.380]   If I, if I'm some fly by night, horrible phone manufacturer and I put up some or absolutely
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:40.220]   awful version of Android and I, and I mess it all up, Google's brand isn't so much hurt.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:45.340]   But if somehow I mess up Google mail and Google maps and Google this and Google that,
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:50.140]   the services that are core to Google's brand, that could hurt Google.
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:54.380]   So, so in a way, isn't Google protecting its apps more than its OS?
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   I mean, right.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.380]   It is protecting its apps.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.860]   I mean, that's why they have sort of all these requirements that manufacturers have to,
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.740]   you know, have to abide by before that they can put Google on the handset and have the
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.940]   Play Store on it.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:11.100]   And yeah, they are protecting their apps, but, but this is the thing, like, Android's open
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.020]   source and the idea is like anybody can come along and fork Android or build on Android
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.900]   and, you know, have a successful operating system too.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:23.100]   It just seems like Google is doing everything they can to kind of make block, block that
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.540]   from actually happening, right?
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.380]   So I never really had a problem with the fact that they did a batch release of all the,
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:33.420]   all the source code on a given date and worked kind of within Google's doors, you know, privately
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:35.860]   buying Google doors during development.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:42.740]   But now I kind of do, now that I can see that they're not keeping the, you know, AOSP up
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:49.420]   to date with, you know, modern Android design guidelines, for example, because they're pouring
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.220]   all their energy into the proprietary apps.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:55.780]   Because that just feels like, well, either iterate in public and let other people contribute
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:00.100]   and keep, and keep the operating system up to date, the open source project up to date,
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.700]   or just close the whole thing, but it feels like, and this is kind of the conclusion we
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.700]   came to in all of it.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:08.820]   Android last night, it's like, yeah, Android is more open than other options, but it's
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:13.100]   not quite as open as Google says, you know, like, this is the first time that I was like,
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:19.620]   oh, so open is a marketing term here, you know, it's not untrue, but it's not completely
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.620]   true either.
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.660]   Well, they didn't call it open source, but they called it opener.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:28.420]   That opener, right, that might be a, whatever, whatever, whatever problem with that.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:34.820]   And correct me if I'm wrong, but the operating system is and continues to be open source.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   That is right.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.820]   That's right.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.020]   But every time we talk about the application layer on top of it, the application layer
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.940]   is, I don't know if I can play with that.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.380]   A lot of apps are not open source.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.140]   Most apps are not open source.
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.620]   You're just thinking, we're not complaining about it because we don't use those apps.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.580]   Like we use the proprietary Google experience apps.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:56.260]   So we're not using the, the, it's a stock messaging app or the stock.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:57.260]   Well, we're using the stock.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.460]   I am, I often use it on signage and mine.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.540]   That's one of the reasons I like Google experience phones because they've got it right.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:08.540]   Because frankly, now the second part is the open handset alliance.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:14.020]   And I think this is where Google probably, I understand why for business reasons, but
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.260]   maybe exerts more influence than they should.
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:20.620]   The open handset alliance is the one that strong arms manufacturers says, if you want,
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.780]   if you want our apps, you better do it right.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   Right.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.700]   So you make the case that there, that as Nintendo learned from Atari's debacle in the gaming
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:33.420]   world that you control the games because the, the quality of the games determines the success
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.380]   of your platform.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.380]   So you could make that argument.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:40.100]   Google's just protecting the platform by making sure that the handset makers do quality
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.180]   implementations.
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.060]   But I think they use it as a strong arm to include the Google apps and to make sure that
[01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.460]   they don't mess around with Android.
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:51.260]   So, so I think what you have is kind of three states.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:53.460]   You have open source operating system.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.060]   Those source apps.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:25:00.500]   But then you have this open handset alliance that is putting exerting economic pressure
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.860]   on companies to toe the line.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:07.540]   I mean, they're, they're, Google's trying to make it so that the best Android experience.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:12.540]   And really it's been effective because the, the best and really the only Android experience
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.940]   is the, is the Google experience, the dominant.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:20.340]   Um, well, and they're winning because God, I hate to touch whiz motor, motor rollers,
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:26.020]   given up blur, HTC as nice as the HTC Sense 5 is, it's still no, no competitor to the
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.540]   Google experience.
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.740]   So, um, I don't know.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.980]   There's such a, there's your proof of the reason to protect.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   Right.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.740]   Is that even, even when you're authorized and do everything right and add this layer on top,
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:38.740]   it's craft.
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:39.740]   Right.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:44.620]   Um, I, you know, I think this is an argument that most of the people who use Android don't
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:45.860]   really appreciate it.
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:46.860]   Understand.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.980]   But it's good one for us to have.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:49.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.860]   So, um, what's the conclusion to you drawn all about Android last night?
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:56.940]   Um, pretty much what we know, what we said that this is, you know, that, that Android
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:02.340]   maybe isn't as open as, you know, we like, we, and I say we like developers like to think
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.740]   that, that it is, that it is kind of a marketing term.
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:10.140]   Um, the, the, that we, you know, celebrate every time Google releases a Google app in
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:14.620]   the play store, you know, like the keyboard and the camera, you know, like the, the, the,
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.820]   the, the, the Google experience apps, but that, and this is Ron's point in the article.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.500]   Every time that happens, that means that there's an open source app, which has been
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:27.300]   abandoned, uh, which, and that which develop development will not continue by Google.
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:31.220]   Abandoned by Google has no responsibility to do that.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.540]   That's the open source community.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.220]   If it wants that option, continue to support it.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:39.660]   But Google doesn't accept, doesn't take code contributions from anyone else.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:42.380]   Only authors of AOSP are Googlers.
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:43.380]   Oh, right.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:45.380]   Oh, we're going to change that.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.940]   You're going to, if you're going to do a Google keyboard, then the AOSP keyboard has to be
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:51.980]   released to the open source community so they can maintain it.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:52.980]   Right.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:53.980]   Exactly.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:57.380]   And it is released, it's released in the AOSP code that gets, you know, sort of batched
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:01.220]   dropped by Google, you know, whatever, it each release, right?
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:06.340]   But it's not as far as I, as far as I know, there are no other companies authoring Android
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:10.260]   modifications and those are getting, those aren't getting accepted back into the, the
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.260]   canonical AOSP.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.380]   It's a one way street.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.020]   It's a one way street.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:20.540]   Oh, that's, you know, that's like open in mostly, you know, mostly in name.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:26.260]   So, so yeah, the, the, the conclusion was that it's just a kind of an awareness of, you
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:29.380]   know, every time we're like, yay, Google Play services is awesome.
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.220]   It's also like boo.
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.820]   Any app that uses Google Play services ain't going to run at any other distribution of
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:35.820]   Android.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.060]   And there's lots of other distributions of Android.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.060]   It's not just fire OS.
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.980]   I mean, China, you know, no one in China could use Google services.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:45.500]   They're all, you know, most Chinese users are using some sort of fork of Android without,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.220]   without all the Google services on top.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.660]   I'd love to know what Steve Condick thinks of this.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.700]   The author of the creative signage and mod.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.700]   I would love to get him on the show sometime.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:57.540]   I know he's a busy guy and he's got his new company and all, but we should try, we should
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:58.540]   try to get him some time.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.540]   Chad or Carson, let's go for Steve Condick, K-O-N-D-I-K.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:07.940]   We're going to add him to our list for either triangulation or twig.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:11.980]   Because he must have, I mean, he, of anybody, he would be the one who's really caught in
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.980]   the middle.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.660]   He makes the open source version basically.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:20.780]   Or his, nice company, but his project, signage and mod.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:23.380]   Although there are lots of mods now using open source.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.460]   I don't know.
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.340]   I mean, I think you could argue that it's the best of both worlds.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:32.100]   We have really a very vibrant ecosystem right now.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.100]   Right.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.860]   And, and, and, and allow them in the chat room.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:37.500]   Of course, anybody could take the AOSP source code.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   Right.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.380]   And modify and update all those apps and maintain that separately.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.380]   That's what Condick did.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.380]   Right.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.380]   And that's what, right.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.380]   That's what Syanna Jim does.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:50.020]   It just, you know, adds another layer of, you know, I would love to see Google accept
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:55.420]   that back into the project and, and have those apps, those stock apps grow and, and reflect
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.300]   the modern, modern Android design principles.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.300]   Right.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:03.820]   Then, then have another, yet another entity kind of maintaining that.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.740]   Let's take a break.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:12.140]   When we come back, your picks of the week tip number pick coming up first, a word from
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:17.300]   personal capital as, as our financial lives get more and more complicated, it would be
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:21.420]   awfully nice, be awfully nice to make some sense of it.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.820]   Well, guess what?
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820]   Computers are designed.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.820]   They're made for this.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.780]   They're good at this.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:31.900]   If you've got accounts scattered everywhere, you're checking your savings, your investments,
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:36.660]   your credit cards, your mortgages, your loans, wouldn't it be nice if you could put them
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:41.100]   all together, get a, a overview, get charts, get the idea of what's going on and then
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:45.460]   make investments based on complete data, not incomplete information.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.660]   That's what personal capital does.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:52.940]   It combines all your financial accounts into a real time snapshot with charts and information,
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.820]   everything you need.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:30:00.900]   And then they help you do your investment strategy based on all of that stuff.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:01.900]   Signing up just takes a minute.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:06.140]   It's very easy to import all your accounts and it'll pay big dividends by helping you
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.860]   make better investment decisions immediately.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:11.780]   I've been using it for more than a year since we interviewed its founder, actually on triangulation.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.780]   And you don't want things for sure.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:15.340]   Your financial life is not going to get simpler.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:16.940]   It's going to get more complicated.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:17.940]   Why wait?
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:18.940]   Sign up.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:19.940]   It's free.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:23.260]   Personal capital.com/twig.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:24.260]   And you're ready to go.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:29.100]   You start entering in your accounts and you'll start seeing the big picture.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:33.100]   Personal capital.com/twig.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:38.220]   We thank Personal Capital for their support of this week in Google Time Now for Gina
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:41.500]   Tarpani's Tip of the Week.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.500]   So I'll admit it.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:46.100]   I saved this one from the change a lot because I just thought it'd be a cool tip.
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.340]   New Google search results fun.
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.780]   If you search for an artist's songs, then you'll get a list of their songs.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:56.460]   So today I Google Pat Benatar songs.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.460]   Really?
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:59.460]   Love Pat Benatar.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:04.940]   I think since we listened to Pat Benatar in the 80s, I thought she was the coolest woman
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.460]   to ever hold a guitar.
[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.460]   Awesome.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.460]   Heck yeah.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.460]   Oh, this is neat.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:10.460]   I like this.
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.980]   Yeah, so you search for Pat Benatar songs and at the top of your search results, there
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:13.980]   you go.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:14.980]   You tried prints.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:15.980]   You get a list, a scrolling list.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:17.140]   So now click on one of the songs.
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.140]   Can I play one?
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.140]   Well, it'll fill.
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.140]   Oh, dang.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.140]   Try another one.
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.140]   Oh, so some of them?
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.140]   If there's a YouTube video.
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.140]   There it is.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.140]   Here's the video.
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:28.820]   If there's a video, then you can click on the video.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:30.540]   Yeah, and then I'll go to the video.
[01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.260]   Not on YouTube, but on guava leaf.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.260]   Guava leaf.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.100]   Well, I think that's good because it shouldn't just be YouTube, should it?
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.500]   It should be whoever's got video.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.900]   Who's ever got the video?
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:40.900]   Right?
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:42.260]   Let's pick the one that Purple Rain's got to be on.
[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:44.100]   This is from myvideo.de.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:45.740]   Oh, wow.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:49.100]   So it isn't just, OK, 1999 will be on YouTube.
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.100]   No, 80svideo.tv.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:51.100]   That's interesting.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.700]   But the other way, you get a video.
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.700]   You get a video.
[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.700]   You get a video to play with a song.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.380]   Now, I wish you could play the video in line and just watch yourself.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.180]   It does make you pop another tab.
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:03.140]   It looks like it's about to do that.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.140]   But it doesn't.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.140]   It doesn't.
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:09.700]   Well, I'm kind of glad it doesn't do Vivo or YouTube here, but it's open.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.700]   What are you searching for?
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   Jonathan Colton?
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.700]   Yes, Jonathan Colton.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:15.300]   So Joe Co has a full stream YouTube link there.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.660]   It's interesting that the YouTube videos are a larger size than other videos.
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.500]   Of course they are.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.900]   Of course they are.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.420]   So yeah, I spend all morning.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:26.180]   Of course it's Prince.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.020]   Prince doesn't allow his stuff up there, right?
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.020]   Oh, right.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.020]   That's right.
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.020]   That's right.
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.020]   Yeah, exactly what it is.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.020]   That's what it is, isn't it?
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.020]   Prince doesn't like the internet.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.020]   Right.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:37.300]   He thinks it's full of thieves.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.980]   Let's try somebody who does.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.980]   Metallica.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.460]   No, that's wrong.
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:43.860]   Jonathan Colton is the right answer.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.700]   By the way, Metallica, you don't even get the thing.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.180]   You get just get like a normal boring search result.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:52.180]   You have to say songs, right?
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.180]   OK.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:54.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.180]   There's songs.
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.180]   Yeah, OK, there it is.
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.180]   Master of puppets.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.180]   Yeah, we got the YouTube.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.180]   All right.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.180]   That's nice.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.180]   Yeah, that's a lot of fun.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.180]   Cool.
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.700]   I mean, of course there are music apps, dedicated music apps where you could probably, you know,
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.740]   have a better interface for creating playlists and things like that.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:14.740]   But this is handy for when you're out with your friends on your phone and you're like,
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.580]   what's that James Taylor song or whatever?
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:20.180]   And you can see it in search results.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.980]   Joan Jett songs.
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:22.980]   Yeah, Joan Jett.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:27.020]   I knew you like her.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.700]   Love hurts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:31.300]   It does take it from me.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:32.300]   Nice.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:33.300]   Nice.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.100]   See, this is why I work with you, Leo.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:41.140]   You know, you know, you know, you know, I know what's going down.
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:44.100]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.780]   My wife hates my taste music.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.500]   Oh, you listen to that Bora Jones.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.260]   Oh, oh, I love Nora Jones.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   She's she's good.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.260]   I like Nora Jones.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.260]   Who does your wife like?
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.260]   You don't be.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:57.260]   I like to.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.260]   I'm over.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.340]   I Odeeda, Nora Jones.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:00.340]   That's really what happened.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.340]   I listened to her.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.340]   I will admit that.
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:05.140]   Well, here's the right problem right now is that as I feel like a really dirty old man,
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.900]   because I bought I bought Lord's album, but it's amazing.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.380]   Who's Lord?
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.380]   Lord.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:14.780]   Lord is a band.
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:20.420]   No, it's the one's his 17 year old girl in New Zealand who's just phenomenal.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:23.860]   She did the song.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.860]   Come on, help me out.
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.860]   Chat room.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.620]   What's your L.O.R.D. or lured?
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:33.060]   Well, no.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:36.100]   L O R D E. Yes, L O R D E.
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.100]   L O R D E.
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:42.180]   Let's play some Lord title is her real name.
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:45.660]   Her real name is Ella Maria Laniellico Connor.
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.660]   That's why she uses Lord.
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.380]   I'll be the boy oils is the hit.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.380]   Royal is the hit.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.980]   That's the hit you recognize.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.780]   Let's play this and get pulled from YouTube right away.
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.060]   No, actually, I think the Prince song did it, even though we only played the first three
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:03.060]   notes.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.540]   You named this lawsuit in three notes.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.540]   All right.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.900]   Oh, that sounds promising.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:15.100]   It does sound promising, but you'll have to just get out.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.940]   Jeff, your number.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940]   So I actually have an A cheat.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940]   I went to an event.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940]   I'm not doing a number.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.940]   I'm going to do something else.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.100]   I went to an event for Google this week, Conflict in the Connected World, Google Ideas,
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.420]   Jared, Colin and Company.
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:33.540]   I was on a panel with Chris Poole and Matt Honan about anonymity.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.540]   But Google announced some really important things there.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.820]   I wanted to make a mention of that.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:40.500]   They announced a project shield initiative.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:46.380]   It's that would host sites that frequently come under politically motivated DDOS attacks.
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:51.700]   It announced UProxy from the University of Washington, which allows users in countries
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:56.420]   like China to access the internet as seen by a friend in a different and unsetsered
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.500]   country.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:05.540]   They put out, if you go to Leo or Chad, if you go to digitalattackmap.com, you see that
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:12.900]   they have a map of current DDOS attacks going on around the world from everywhere.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:17.740]   So they're doing a lot about security because of people in Conflict Zone.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:20.740]   So I thought that was important, at least giving them a plug since it is a show about
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:21.740]   Google.
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.740]   How interesting.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.740]   That's different.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.340]   Well, this is their Google Ideas video about it.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:30.140]   Oh, I see there.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:31.420]   It's funny.
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:34.740]   We talked about Project Shield on Security Now this week.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:37.620]   Security, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:45.060]   Yeah, here's the data visualization of current attacks, trending DDOS attacks.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.060]   Wow.
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.060]   They're all holding in.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.140]   There's the ocean there is the ones they can't figure out where and to they're going
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.140]   from.
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.140]   Wow.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.940]   That makes it look like everything's hitting North Carolina.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:59.300]   No, it looks like Washington, D.C. is DDOS in China.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:06.060]   Six U.S. is coming out of the U.S. and going to a lot of places, but focused specifically
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.060]   on China.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:10.860]   I don't know who would do that.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:17.780]   You know, it's not what you'd thought.
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:19.780]   It's us attacking them.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:22.100]   Well, it's the other funny thing.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:29.820]   If you saw this right before air, their Spiegel revealed that Angela Merkel called Barack Obama
[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:36.420]   and gave him what for because of reports that the U.S. had hacked her cell phone.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.620]   Oh, well, you know.
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.220]   Aren't we proud?
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.620]   She's just joined the crowd, Angela.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.620]   We're all being acted.
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:48.900]   So, yeah, she was she was pretty angry.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:49.900]   She was pretty angry.
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:53.380]   By the way, what separates the U.S. government from Rupert Murdoch in News Corp?
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:56.820]   You know, is that a telegraph revelation?
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:58.820]   Is that a Snowden revelation?
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:37:59.820]   The telegraph?
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:01.460]   What's your mouth out, Leo?
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:02.460]   What did I say?
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.460]   Telegraph?
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.460]   I meant Guardian.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.460]   Guardian.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:09.180]   I think I think that one perfectly from Der Spiegel.
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.740]   Somebody's been saying, yeah, what's from Der Spiegel?
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:11.740]   You're right.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:15.460]   Somebody's been saying that the Guardian's been cleverly one head of state after another
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.140]   feeling because it was France earlier, right?
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.700]   Yeah, I bet.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.700]   Yeah, France is pissed off.
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:23.540]   Germany is pissed off.
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:27.660]   So okay, we're going to lighten the mood here.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:31.820]   I just have been informed by the chatroom that tomorrow, PopCap Games will finally release
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:39.260]   plants versus zombies to for Android in the U.S. there was some talk that maybe Apple
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.260]   had paid them.
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.220]   Why was it on iOS for so long?
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:48.500]   PopCap was at great pain and say, no, no, no, we just, you know, that's we did it first.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.540]   And so good news tomorrow.
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:54.820]   By the time you hear this, if you're listening after the fact, plants versus zombies too highly
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:55.820]   recommended.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.420]   Somebody's really going to win the aperina next week.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:01.620]   Whoever gets this one, it's all over.
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:04.380]   Yeah, this is such an addicting game.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   It's really fun.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.780]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:11.100]   We do this show every Wednesday afternoon, right after security now, but 1 p.m. Pacific
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:16.140]   4 p.m. Eastern time 2000 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.260]   That's going to change because we're going to win.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:23.020]   When is when is the daylight savings time end in the U.S. or summertime's ending soon,
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:32.540]   which will for those of you who live in the UTC, which does back an hour.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:33.540]   Now they saying it's out now.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.900]   I don't I don't see it.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.180]   Maybe it's it was out in New Zealand plants versus zombies too and other places.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.820]   So maybe maybe it depends where you are not plants versus zombies one.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.820]   That's been out for ages.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:46.180]   I'm PVZ two.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.820]   If you can't watch live, don't worry.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:53.940]   We always have on demand versions available after the oh yeah, it looks like it.
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.900]   No, these are not these are not the real thing.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.660]   These are fake ones.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.740]   Do not be fooled by things like that.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:03.700]   Most likely malware.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:08.260]   Wait for the one from electronic arts pop cap.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.940]   If you want to watch after the fact, go to twitch.tv/twig.
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:11.940]   You can also join us in the studio.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:14.060]   A nice little studio audience today.
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.300]   Just email tickets at twitch.tv.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:19.380]   We'll make sure there's a chair available for you to sit in coming up in triangulation.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.220]   We're going to talk to the founder.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.220]   Very excited.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:24.300]   Ladar Levinson.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:28.940]   The guy who was shut down or decided to shut down instead of giving the federal government
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:37.500]   the keys to lava bit his encrypted email solution that reputed Lee Edwards Snowden used to
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.900]   leak some of this information.
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:41.220]   So Ladar will join us.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:42.460]   Okay, people are giving me the link.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:43.860]   Let me let me check the link.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:44.860]   Maybe it's available now.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:45.860]   electronic arts.
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:48.660]   Oh, and somebody in the chat room asked, what time in the Google event tomorrow?
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:52.100]   It's a 4 p.m. Eastern and it'll be in New York.
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:54.620]   And we know that's not right.
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.140]   Pretty sure that that is not the next spot.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.220]   It's a play store announcement.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:01.020]   We think it's newsstand.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.540]   Which is play magazine being renamed newsstand.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:04.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:08.260]   I want my Nexus 5.
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:09.260]   Thank you.
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:13.460]   So we, if you can't find it in search, sometimes apps when a app first comes out.
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.260]   It is on their plants versus zombies too.
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.260]   That's exciting.
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:18.660]   I'm installing it right now.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.020]   Just lost my week.
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.020]   There goes your wake.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.020]   Yep, there goes.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.020]   Yep.
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.380]   By the way, I want to apologize.
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:31.020]   If anybody installed the any due calendar app, because I mentioned it last week, I don't
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:33.500]   know if you had this problem, but I'm going to tell you a problem I had for some reason
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:37.580]   it did something to my calendar services and it was killing my battery.
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:38.740]   Sometimes happens with beta software.
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:40.900]   This was beta software.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.620]   So I deleted it didn't work.
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.620]   I reinstalled it.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:47.020]   Also just finally, I just had to rebuild my entire phone.
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.740]   No, no, and it's back.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:50.740]   It's normal.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.740]   It's okay now.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:55.380]   If I was a savvy marketing person, this is the point where I would plug to do text.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:58.700]   Yeah, to do text to do text.
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:00.620]   Don't do that any due calendar thing.
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:03.260]   Wait till it's at plain old reels.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.980]   And I apologize if that happened to you as well.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:09.180]   That was not my intent.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:10.180]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.540]   We'll see you next Wednesday on this week.
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.980]   Can Google buy Jeff by Gina?
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:24.380]   (music)
