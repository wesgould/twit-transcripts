[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Mac Cuts,
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.120]   Aaron Nukem, Jeff Jarvis and I will talk about Google Maps.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120]   Where are they?
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.840]   They're missing on my new iPhone.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.720]   We'll talk about what might have happened there.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.560]   And Sergey Brin as Locutus of Borg,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.400]   it's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.400]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.800]   From people you trust.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.080]   This is Twig.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.880]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly.

[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.560]   This is Twig.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.360]   This week in Google, episode 165, recorded September 26, 2012.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.560]   Shaka, when the walls fell.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.480]   This week in Google is brought to you by Ford.

[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.720]   It's time for this week in Google.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.280]   And before we go much farther, we have a great panel.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.800]   I'm going to introduce some.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.800]   But we can finally let it be heard.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.680]   Actually, let me help.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.440]   Let me introduce Jeff.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.480]   Because Jeff can help me on this.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.680]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.240]   where he teaches journalism, the author of what
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.120]   will Google do in his brand new and public parts.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.560]   He blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.600]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.960]   Hey, are you?
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.280]   So our cohort--
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.360]   We missed dearly, but for good cause.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.440]   Yeah, Ms. Gina Trapani was not here last week.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.680]   And we didn't really know exactly why at first.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.920]   But she then sent us an email.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   She said that her wife had to go into the hospital.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.080]   And we were a little bit concerned about that.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.360]   But it turned out she was in the hospital for a happy reason.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.040]   She was indeed.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.440]   And right after the show, we got the email
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.840]   and showed it to Leo back in the studio.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.960]   And that five weeks premature, but they
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.440]   are the problem others of a baby girl named Ethon.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.360]   Oh, and let me show you.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.600]   Because she did tweet the picture.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.240]   So it's public.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.740]   She did.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.240]   Oh, it's good.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.880]   It's public knowledge.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.560]   It's on her Twitter.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.520]   Dear internet last night, my daughter was born.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.120]   Moms and baby are doing great.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.040]   Meet our new baby girl.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.240]   And so congratulations to Gina.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.280]   What is her wife's name?
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   I forgot.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.400]   Oh, and you're going to ask me that.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.920]   I forgot.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   I should know that.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.880]   I should know it too.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   Such a cute kid, though.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.400]   Anyway, yeah.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.560]   So we're really happy.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.520]   So Gina has been spending a lot of time in the hospital.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   Because baby Edda is a little-- not badly premature, I think.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.400]   Five weeks.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.160]   I think a lot of weeks is not too bad.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.640]   No.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   But you end up keeping them longer, though, when they're that.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.240]   What are you?
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.680]   Keep an eye on her.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.040]   She looks like she's doing well.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.960]   And so they're spending a lot of time there.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.360]   But that's really great.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.680]   We're really happy for you, Gina.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.600]   Congratulations.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.280]   And she is on Cloud 9, as you might imagine.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.800]   She's just been really happy.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.600]   Do we send flowers?
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960]   Can we send some flowers to Gina?
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.440]   Now let me introduce the panel.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.880]   So that's why Gina has gone this week.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.600]   She may be gone a few more weeks, because she really
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.320]   does want to be there for baby Edda.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.840]   But she assures us she's not abandoning the show.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.280]   She will be back.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.240]   With us now from Google, Matt Cutts,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.960]   who's in charge of fighting spam on the Google web search
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   results.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.120]   Great to have you back, Matt.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.240]   Good to be back.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.400]   And also, you seem to be living here lately.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.920]   We welcome also Aaron from Oracle or Sun or a Witch.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.480]   I can't ever--
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.280]   Let's go with the Source Show.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.960]   That's better.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.560]   Recuses me of saying anything I wouldn't want to say.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.240]   Aaron Newcomb, who has his own podcast
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.640]   called The Source Show at thesourceshow.com,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.560]   but also is a regular on Floss Weekly.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.440]   And it was just on Al and Ball about Android,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.920]   like a couple hours ago.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.420]   Oh, right.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.520]   Literally.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.640]   Last night, so--
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.320]   Anyway, it's great to have you, Aaron.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.120]   So we'll make a deal.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.360]   When we talk about Java, you can recuse yourself.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.840]   When we talk about Google, you can recuse yourself, Matt.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.600]   That way, everybody will be happy.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.680]   Because we are going to talk about Google just a little bit.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.520]   In fact, quite a bit.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.000]   There are lots of news.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.600]   Our top story really has to do with Google Maps.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.120]   And this is a story that's been breaking, even as we speak.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.520]   So as most people by now know, certainly,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.480]   if you listen to any Twitch show we've been talking about,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.840]   the fact that Apple booted Google Maps and iOS 6,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.640]   replacing them with their own Maps product, which
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.280]   they had talked about at WWDC in June.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.840]   And in fact, it turns out, according to many reports,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.880]   that June was when Google learned about it,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.960]   they were a little shocked because Apple had over a year
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.400]   left on its contract.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.920]   We had initially heard that the contract had run out.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.880]   This story by Chris Ziegler in The Verge
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.920]   says that his sources say that two independent sources familiar
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.320]   with the matter say that the agreement had another year to run.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.760]   And Google was sent scrambling to develop an iOS Google Maps
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.360]   app, which both sources stay is still incomplete,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.080]   currently not scheduled to ship for several months.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   That now clarifies Eric Schmidt's comments of two days ago,
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.560]   where he said, hey, what are we supposed to do?
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.960]   Force Apple to include our Maps product.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.240]   And others who have said, well, we
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.520]   want to be on every platform.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.760]   It's clear that this was a business decision on Apple's part.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.280]   And of course, Apple's getting a lot of heat
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.880]   because the iOS maps, some say, are not as good.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.600]   Now, I think it depends a lot on where you are.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   According to people I've heard from in China,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.680]   it's actually better Apple bought data in China
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360]   that was better than the data Google was using.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.720]   Maybe a data problem, right?
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.240]   Is it data?
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.840]   Well, it's no source issue.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.160]   It's not just data sources.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.520]   Tom Tom was quick to point out.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.800]   They said, it's not our fault.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.240]   That's where most of the data for Apple's maps come from.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.760]   It really seems to be-- and I think
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.400]   this is pretty clear from the way Google works.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.600]   This is-- it's a question of merging disparate sources.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.240]   Always a problem because it's an impedance mismatch.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.200]   So there are GIS standards for mapping data,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.280]   but it's more than that because it's not just mapping data.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.360]   You also have points of interest, which Apple's getting
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   from Yelp and other places.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   Those have to somehow be properly merged in.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.040]   Google said last week that they've
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.880]   been working on this for 400 years.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.800]   Matt, can you explain that number?
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.400]   Actually, that was an interesting-- the headline
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.120]   on that story said Google's been working on it
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.640]   for over 400 years, but Google never said that.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.000]   I hate headlines.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.800]   I get bit by headlines every single show.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.000]   So Google was essentially saying that there
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.320]   are a lot of manpower.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.880]   Yeah, there have been a lot of stories
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.640]   that point out that mapping is really hard.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.000]   Getting the points of interest, aligning things,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.600]   all those street view cars.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   There was an article in Business Insider
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.320]   several months ago that claimed 7,000 Google employees work
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.920]   on maps in various different ways,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.320]   or Google contractors and people like that.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.640]   So mapping is fundamentally a very hard problem.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.080]   And that's just the reality of the situation.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.760]   It's going to be a difficult problem.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.400]   So I wonder whether Google probably wasn't planned this way,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.240]   but I wonder whether Google isn't just as well off
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.280]   for at least some delay, because Apple Maps are getting
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   some crap out there.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.960]   People do miss their Google Maps.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.800]   And, gee, it was Apple's fault not ours.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   And maybe some of you don't really
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.440]   want to go run it out to buy that new Google.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.920]   You've got to be really careful, though, in today's world.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.880]   You can't be too any competitive.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.240]   So the last thing you'd ever hear Google say is, yeah, yeah,
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.880]   you go enjoy those Apple Maps.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.440]   We still got some good maps over here on the Android side
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   of the equation.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.640]   But I think that that's the case right now.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.080]   And you're right, it's probably good for Android.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.360]   Well, and it was kind of funny, because I'm far enough away
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.120]   that I don't know all the internals of those kinds
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.200]   of negotiations, of course.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.400]   But you read the headline or the story that says there
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.520]   was a year left on the contract.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.120]   And that sounds plausible.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.400]   I can definitely believe that.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.160]   But it is the kind of thing where, if you've seen the tumbler
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.480]   of the different iOS 6 stuff, there
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.680]   was one that had a route to the San Jose airport.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.600]   And it went over the runway.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   And so that--
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.520]   You really would want to follow that map.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.680]   But yeah, that made me gasp.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.080]   But it's definitely the case that it'll get better over time.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.880]   Yeah, but why is this--
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.240]   Is the tumbler that you're talking about, the amazing iOS 6
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.440]   maps?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.320]   Yes.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.440]   The amazing iOS 6 maps.tumbler.com.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.520]   I've got a few of them here.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.360]   And they are.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.040]   They really show a world that is very different.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.200]   For some reason, that's white.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.360]   I don't know why somebody painted the landscape white.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.240]   Here's the one you were--
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.960]   the Helsinki Central Railway Station is a park.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.680]   But you know, you expect this.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.120]   It's a big world.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   I don't expect it.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.760]   This is Apple we're talking about.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.160]   I personally feel like they should have tested this
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.440]   a little bit more thoroughly before they put it out.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.760]   Yeah, but how many of their services have they messed up?
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.320]   Remember back to various of their cloud services
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.840]   that were horribly messed up at the beginning.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.560]   They make products a different way.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.160]   But services at Apple have never been--
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.680]   well, not never, but have often been messed up on launch.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.160]   No?
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.520]   Yeah, I apparently--
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.680]   The Huey Long Bridge is available at Home Depot.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.640]   That's good to know in New Orleans.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.880]   New Orleans is actually more messed up than many other cities.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.680]   It was at Hubris, you think, that Apple thought it could do this?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.960]   It was interesting, because remember, just before WWDC,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.800]   Google held a hastily convened mapping event at which they
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.840]   showed the new 3D map views that they were getting by plane.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.000]   And I think there'd been a number of articles
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.120]   before the iPhone 5 was announced.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.800]   And before it came out, people invited
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.880]   into the secret Google mapping center
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.680]   and a tour of how we're doing it.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.240]   It's clear that all along Google's been saying exactly this.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.440]   This is hard stuff.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.800]   We know what we've been doing it.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.560]   Nokia could probably make the same case.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.440]   Nokia has been doing a very good job with its maps, which
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.640]   are used by Bing and by Amazon and, of course,
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   by Windows Phone and Microsoft.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.320]   Is it Hubris?
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.800]   Did Apple bite off more than they can chew?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.120]   I mean, to me, it certainly feels like it was rushed.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.200]   And you're right.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.880]   I mean, even Google Maps, when it first came out,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.720]   wasn't like it is today.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.920]   It's taking time.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.360]   And it's still not perfect, by the way.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.760]   There's always a little problem.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.240]   But it just feels really rushed.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.760]   And I wonder if-- to me, that's the more interesting thing
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.240]   to think about.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.200]   Was it a rush to get away from Google?
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.040]   Or was it a rush to get--
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.600]   because they really saw the intrinsic value of all the data
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.320]   that comes from having your own maps
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.280]   and getting people reporting their locations back to you?
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.480]   Or was it just coincidence that it just happened to be--
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.120]   they happened to not see these problems when
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.720]   they were testing it?
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.440]   I don't know.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.200]   It's very clear that this is from a business decision.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.360]   And I think some of the criticism Apple's getting
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.680]   is from people who said, hey, Apple, you used to say you cared
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.200]   about users and the user experience.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.880]   But clearly, you've made this decision that is not best
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.920]   for user experience for business reasons.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.680]   But come on.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.160]   I think only somebody totally naive
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.240]   would believe that Apple doesn't make decisions
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.160]   for business reasons.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.000]   They're a business.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.280]   Yeah, but the question is not that so much
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.200]   as do they have the discipline they should have,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.760]   which is what you're saying.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.240]   I don't know.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.520]   It is the magic gone.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.280]   You see stock stories now wondering
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.600]   whether it's hit its peak.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.440]   We'll see.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.520]   The music thing for me this week is, as you see,
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.800]   they've been trying to Google--
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.240]   was trying to push Google Maps.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.040]   And of course, it just released a street view in the ocean.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.120]   And the joke there, of course, is that Apple Maps will take you--
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.960]   dump you into the ocean accidentally.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.760]   Google, I'm purposeful.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.080]   At least we'll show you what you're looking at.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:03.320]   I also think that this is more than just business
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.520]   in the sense that let's screw Google.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.240]   I think what really is going on here
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.840]   is that every company has realized
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.920]   that mobile and location are the future.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.960]   And somebody said this on Twitter.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.280]   I think it was Peter Rojas of Gadget
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.640]   that Apple was a computer company.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.280]   Let's not forget.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.800]   That's its genesis.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.280]   And realized at some point that mobile was happening.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.360]   I mean, all they had to do was look at the sales of their iPhones,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.920]   which they make far more money on now
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.880]   than they ever did on computers.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.480]   And that in order to compete-- and Nokia realized this, too.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.440]   Nokia spent something like $10 billion
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.280]   to have a foot in mapping and mobile.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.920]   Even Amazon is going to map you because they
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.640]   want to deliver to you locally.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's where the world is moving.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.680]   So if you're going to compete as a company and survive
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.440]   as a company, you need to be strong in mobile and location,
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.280]   right?
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.120]   Yes.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.360]   That's the first layer of data for targeting,
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.240]   especially when you have mobile devices and mobile services.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.000]   Where's the nearest pizza?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.320]   Is the beginning of the small data you need?
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.160]   Contro who has a counter notions blog.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.360]   And this is quoted by Jean-Louis Gassain on the Monday note.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.720]   It says, in answer to the question,
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.320]   why did an Apple kick Google Maps, or why did Apple kick
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.880]   Google Maps off the iOS platform?
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.160]   Shouldn't Apple have waited?
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.960]   His response is, wait for what?
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.840]   For Google to strengthen his chokehold on a key iOS service,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.040]   Apple has recognized the significance of mobile mapping
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.400]   and acquired several mapping companies, which they did.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.160]   And they were on a buying spree over the last year.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.000]   IP assets and talent-- that we heard from TechCrunch
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.440]   that they're actively courting Google Map contractors,
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.640]   trying to get them over to Apple to help out.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.520]   Mapping is indeed one of the hardest mobile services
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.400]   contro goes on to write involving physical, terrestrial,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.360]   and aerial surveying data acquisition correction--
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.120]   that's maybe where Apple's fallen down--
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.720]   tile making and layer upon layer of contextual info
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.360]   married to underlying data, all optimized to serve often
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.400]   under trying network conditions.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   Unfortunately, like dialect recognition or speech synthesis,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.520]   think Siri, mapping is one of those technologies
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.360]   that cannot be-- and this is the important point--
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.160]   cannot be fully incubated in a lab for a few years
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.880]   and unleashed.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.240]   You need to put it out in the wild for it to mature.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.200]   And that's what you said that Google Maps, Jeff, when they came out
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.520]   weren't great, but they have been around now for how many years.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.560]   And they've been collecting a lot of user data,
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.840]   so they have gotten better.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.280]   Apple needed to do this.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.360]   Apple's never been hesitant to take a--
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.280]   to bite the bullet and do something that's tough
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.000]   in order to be competitive.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.720]   Brag about the number of data points
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.040]   they've gathered on the Maps through use, which really matters.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.720]   But as I said on the show last week, though,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.200]   I think it does become a new splitting point here,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.000]   is that the reason that I have now switched to my Android phone
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.680]   is because of Google's services.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.360]   And it's my Gmail and my calendar and all that.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.040]   But Maps is one of those.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   And I think that for iOS users to say, oh, we have to lay this phone,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.280]   we have to lay this phone, and where
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.320]   do we have to have to have our Maps?
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.920]   And yeah, it's a business decision on Apple's part.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.080]   But the other thing you have to ask is, don't you
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.040]   have to super serve your customers?
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.760]   And if your customers do want that option,
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.680]   shouldn't add another option for Apple
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.560]   would have been to leave both on.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.640]   And the Apple fanboys would have gone to Apple Maps.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.000]   They would have had time to work it out.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.960]   They could have pulled it over.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.280]   And then they could have pulled it out of iOS 7 or something.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.640]   Instead, the switchover before they were ready--
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.520]   that's so cool.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.320]   Unless there was a not-compete clause that Apple, in the contract,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.600]   that Apple couldn't have its own mapping,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.680]   but I doubt that.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.360]   How about this?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.400]   How about we're seeing-- and I actually applaud this,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   at least because it makes our job much more interesting.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.160]   We're seeing a couple of companies, Apple and Microsoft,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   take massive chances, risk pissing off their embedded base
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.120]   of users with Windows 8 and this new Maps thing
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.360]   in order to move forward.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.720]   And that these companies are bold and brave.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.040]   And this is what we keep saying.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.080]   We want companies to take chances to be bold and brave.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.600]   And Apple's doing that.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.880]   Isn't that what Apple's doing?
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.560]   Isn't that a good thing?
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.240]   It's interesting.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.720]   It's risky.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   It is risky.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.280]   But there was an article that came out just today
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.760]   that talked about developers in Windows 8.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.120]   And some of the article-- the comments on Hacker News
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.440]   were saying, well, but we just got used to this one API two
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   years ago, and now we've got to switch to a new API.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.960]   Or the risk, I guess, would also be there was a new study that
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.120]   just came out that said iOS's customer satisfaction dropped
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.960]   for the first time ever.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.280]   For the first time ever.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.880]   Now, the thing is, it makes sense.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.720]   And I understand why Apple wants to be the master
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.280]   of their destiny.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.040]   And so I think ultimately they have
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.960]   to choose on what the impact will be on users
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.080]   and how good they can make it, how fast,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.520]   and all that sort of stuff.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.440]   The main thing I would just say as a Google employee
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.640]   is that there's a lot of love for Apple at Google.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.240]   There's a lot of articles that want to push the companies apart
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.280]   or try to turn it into an adversarial thing.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.520]   And we mostly run on Macs whenever the engineers are
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.160]   in the meetings.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.200]   I'm like the one guy with the Linux computer.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.320]   And it's all MacBook Airs all around the table other than me.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.760]   And so there's a lot of people that use and love Mac products
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.240]   at Google.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.480]   So it would be interesting to learn how Apple's feeling
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.760]   about it on their side.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   I'm sure that many, if not all, Apple engineers use Google.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.280]   I think you--
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.440]   I remember waiting in line in 2007 for the first iPhone
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.480]   for six hours.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.080]   I was sitting next to two Google engineers
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.480]   who were working on Reader.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.560]   And they told me they had spent the last 48 hours
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.480]   sleeplessly updating Reader to work well with the iPhone.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.960]   So I think you're absolutely right.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.880]   I think-- and I don't think that love is gone,
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.040]   at least among the ground level troops.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.680]   These are high level business decisions.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.120]   And what we're seeing is a battleground.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.200]   And Jeff, we've talked about this on almost every show.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.360]   This is a battleground now.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.240]   Location is a battleground for Facebook.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.680]   Amazon, by saying, we're going to do maps too.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.760]   We're going to use Nokia Maps.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.920]   They're saying we're in this to everybody.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.240]   That's what this Kindle HD, Fire HD is all about.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.320]   It's location.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.600]   And it's mobile.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.640]   And I think that Apple's doing what it had to do.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.720]   And I think Apple fully understands the risk.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.960]   As you just talked about this--
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.280]   I hadn't thought about this before.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.680]   But I've argued that we were moving in the economy,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.720]   in many cases, from vertically integrated industries
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.920]   to ecosystems with platforms and entrepreneurial development
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.000]   and then networks, right?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.440]   We're one replaces the other.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.040]   The funny thing here is what's happening
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.400]   in the former world of platforms is they're going back
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.560]   into being vertically integrated industries.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.480]   So that each one of these has software.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.440]   It has services.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.960]   It has hardware.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   And that's Amazon and Apple and commerce.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.200]   And that's Google and Amazon and Apple.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.080]   All of them doing all of those things.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.200]   It's part of the reason that I guess
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.800]   Arrington keeps on trying to yell at Facebook and Twitter,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.240]   when you're going to get your phone,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.760]   because everybody has to operate the same.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.040]   And I'm not sure that's true at all.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.760]   No, I think Facebook is a good example where--
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.680]   Integrated industry.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.520]   There's a good example, because Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.200]   said this over and over.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.480]   We're not going to build a phone.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   We don't need to build a phone.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.240]   We need to be on every phone that's built.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.440]   So maybe that is the other thing.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.880]   Maybe Apple and Google could have worked together.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.280]   But the question is, does Apple get access to that data
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.680]   that is so important and so valuable to Apple?
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.480]   They don't, right?
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.440]   Google gets the data.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.960]   What do they want to do with it?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.480]   Facebook, their story's out about how they're
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.600]   changing their ad structure.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.040]   And Facebook wants to deal about relationship data.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.600]   Google wants to deal with relationship data,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.720]   because it can make a portion on that in terms of advertising
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.880]   and how commerce and services.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.960]   Amazon can do that.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.600]   The odd thing to me in this equation
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.400]   is I don't see how Apple benefits from relationship data.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.080]   Yeah, they can sell me some songs
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.960]   and sell me some movies and stuff.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.560]   But that's kind of where it ends.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.280]   They're really in the rest of the system.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.160]   Well, that's the question.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.040]   I think Apple thinks it's in the hardware business, but maybe.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.680]   But it's not in the advertising business, right?
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.880]   No, it's in the hardware business.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.560]   Right.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.440]   But is that sufficient?
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.520]   Is that worth all of this effort?
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.720]   I mean, yeah, it's the most valuable company in the world.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.160]   So I guess it is.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.760]   But I understand the strategy of data, data, data,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.480]   for those other three companies.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.720]   I don't see a strategy yet out of Apple for how it--
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.200]   Good point.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.160]   --really maximizes and optimizes the exploitation of that data.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.720]   Good point.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.600]   Do you guys think I'm wrong?
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.680]   I think they're building the foundation of that right now.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.120]   And I think that's what this is all about.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.080]   Maybe they can't capitalize on it right now with what they've got.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.240]   But that's what this is all about.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.320]   They're building that foundation.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.720]   They're gathering that data.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.040]   And I'm sure you'll see services come out based on this data
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.320]   later, like in future releases.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.680]   That's a reinvention of the company now.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.640]   But they've taken what they've done with iTunes, for example.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   I mean, they were one of the pioneers of this.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.400]   But they always said, we don't make money on iTunes.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.080]   It's to sell hardware.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.160]   True, they do make a cut though, right?
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.640]   They make 30% just--
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.880]   They say, no, I don't know.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.480]   Claim covers the costs.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.080]   It's in their interest, in other words,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.520]   to recommend another album based on my interest, let's say.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.720]   I'm interested in this, this, and this.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.400]   Wouldn't you like to buy this?
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.880]   I mean, I think they want to sell more stuff.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.760]   So I think that both in the hardware business
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.400]   and in other things that they'll come up with,
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.000]   it's about differentiating their hardware, in this case,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.680]   the iPhone, in future versions with the data
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.440]   that they're getting right now, or they will be getting
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.360]   from their map services.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.400]   All right, let me throw another data point in that
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.440]   may change everything.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.560]   You want another one?
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.840]   This article just published in All Things D
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.640]   by John Pachkowski, who has excellent sources in Apple.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.320]   He says, the talks between Apple and Google over Maps
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.320]   crashed over voice-guided directions.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.440]   Multiple sources familiar with Apple's thinking
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.880]   say the company felt it had no choice but to replace
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.640]   Google Maps because of a disagreement overturned by turn.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.240]   Spoken turn by turn has always been offered on Android
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.440]   as a free service, but it was never part of the deal
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.040]   that brought Google's maps to iOS.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.000]   Apple wanted, now this is going to turn everything
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.640]   upside down, Apple wanted turn by turn,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.520]   and Google wouldn't do it.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.000]   It wasn't part of the deal in Google.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   Google's the one that wants to differentiate.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.240]   That's an error.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.560]   Apple pushed Google hard to provide the data it needed
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.800]   to bring voice-guided navigation to iOS,
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.640]   but according to people familiar with Google's thinking,
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.960]   the search giant which had invested massive sums
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.880]   in creating that data and views it as a key feature
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.120]   of Android wasn't willing to simply hand it over
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.560]   to a competing platform.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.520]   This changes the conversation entirely.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.120]   It's now saying Apple wanted parody with Android,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.360]   and Google said, no, we're going to keep that benefit,
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.200]   which is a huge benefit.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.120]   And I think it's the reason a lot of people
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.480]   move to Android is not just turn by turn,
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.080]   but turn by turn with Street View
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.840]   so that when you pull up, Devorax discovered this,
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.240]   and he can't stop talking about it.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.040]   Like John has been here for years.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.720]   When you pull up in front of a place,
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.680]   it shows you a picture of where you're going,
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.080]   which is hugely valuable.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.280]   Yeah, that's where I'm going.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.200]   Apple wanted it, and Google said, no, how about that?
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.440]   - So that says that, right, it turns it on its head,
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.080]   that says I'm full of crap, and that the strategy,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.920]   in this case--
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   - Notice I saved that till after you--
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.160]   - And throw it.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.520]   - And it let you give you a bunch of ropes.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.760]   (laughing)
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.600]   - No, 'cause I think both points of view are commonly,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.640]   well not both points of view, your point of view,
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.200]   and I would say I held it as well,
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.600]   is that this was Apple saying, hey, it's time for us
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.840]   to get in location, and maybe, is Apple just saying--
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.680]   - Think that it would really hurt--
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.960]   So that goes back to my earlier crack about Google saying,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.760]   hey, what the heck, if we're not on there for a few months?
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.000]   What does it mean? - Big deal.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.440]   - Very interesting.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.920]   I don't know who's right on this one.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.280]   One source familiar with Apple and Google's negotiations
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.720]   told all things D, quote, "There were a number of issues
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.760]   "in flaming negotiations, but voice navigation
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.680]   "was the biggest, ultimately it was a deal breaker."
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.960]   And that's when Apple quietly began acquiring mapping companies,
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.840]   fast-tracked develop of an in-house maps app with,
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.560]   turn by turn, right, with an eye toward making it
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.720]   a tent pole feature of iOS 6, and that's when it decided
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.560]   to dump Google Maps entirely.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.760]   Now I think because of the
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.960]   Bruhaha over the Google voice app,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.240]   where Apple did not approve it for a long time,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.320]   didn't say they had an approve, it just didn't approve it,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.680]   and then got a letter from, was it Marky?
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.160]   I can't remember somebody in Congress,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.240]   and then the Department of Justice saying,
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.760]   hey, can you explain this, Google?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.960]   Why are you saying no to--
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.880]   And they said, oh, no, no, we didn't not approve it,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.280]   we approve it, it's approved!
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.000]   So I have a feeling, and ever since Chrome
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.480]   and everything has been instant,
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.320]   so I have a feeling, even if Apple would like to say no
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.720]   to a Google Maps app, that they'll have to say yes,
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.560]   the rumor is that there is one in development,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.280]   but it won't be available until maybe Christmas
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.120]   at the early end.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.960]   Matt, and I wanna say this upfront,
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.600]   is not speaking for Google when he's on this show.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.040]   He's on his part. - And I'm far enough away
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   that all I do is, whenever I can test software internally
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.280]   at Google, I enjoy testing it,
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.560]   but I have no idea about what negotiations happen,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.000]   or whether there's an app in development.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.520]   - You can tell us what your dog fooding then,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.600]   go ahead, go ahead, tell us.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.720]   - Yeah, do you have an iOS Google Maps app, Lion or what?
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.640]   - Well, no, unfortunately, I use the Galaxy Nexus,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.040]   so I wouldn't know anything about it.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.920]   - Convenient. (laughs)
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.080]   - I'm sorry, we'll never get Matt back
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   if we do that kind of thing.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.960]   We don't ever mean to put you on the spot.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.360]   - Apparently, we're nicer than spammers.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.800]   - Hey, let's talk about that.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.080]   - I wanna take a break. - In transition.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.000]   - We'll come back.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.280]   Matt got a nice letter from Senator John D. Rockefeller
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.720]   on Tuesday. - I'll put it about.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.000]   - Yeah, we'll talk about that letter
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.200]   that Rockefeller sent, not just to Google,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.320]   but to Microsoft and Yahoo.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.080]   But first, a word from our friends at Ford,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.840]   who believe in social too.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.120]   Now, we think what, come on, it's a car company.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.600]   And this is, one of the things,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   one of the reasons that we're really happy
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   to have Ford as a sponsor,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.440]   and I think one of the reasons
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.360]   that Ford is so visible in new media
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.200]   and podcasts and on websites,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.800]   is 'cause they really are excited about the potential
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.880]   that the 21st century consumer electronics technology,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.840]   like smartphones and social media,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   can bring to a 20th century industrial company
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.520]   like an automobile company.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.760]   I think they've done it better than,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.080]   I know they've done it better than anyone else.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   I first really fell in love with Ford's Sync
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.440]   in my 2010 Mustang.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.720]   And you know, I've been singing its praises.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.160]   And then they added AppLink
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.680]   so that you could have your smartphone apps
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.800]   talk to Ford's Sync,
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.880]   so you could actually bring new apps into the car
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.640]   just by bringing in a smartphone.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.240]   And now they've created a social site
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.040]   to help share the ideas, help, you learn about it.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.440]   They've got a bunch of great articles,
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.880]   and I admit they're great because I wrote one of them,
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.160]   actually an interview I had with Jim Butchkowski,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.240]   who's a lead technologist at Ford.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.640]   And then one of the things I asked about
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.000]   was the AppLink API for Sync and what apps might be coming.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.040]   We also talked a little bit about autonomous vehicles
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.240]   'cause I know that something you all are very interested in.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.600]   You can find that article here,
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.240]   along with a lot of other articles
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.640]   about Ford technologies, your stories, of course.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.600]   And I love this, a social suggestion box.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.320]   Replays one, I love this.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.480]   And you can vote on these ideas.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   Replace the windshield with a 4K LED flat panel HD display
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.120]   with night vision capability.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.600]   The vehicle would have a steel metal covering
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.280]   where the windshield would be.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.200]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens,
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.320]   but that's what's cool about this.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.080]   This is a place where you could put your ideas,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.000]   however futuristic or crazy or whatever,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.920]   people can vote on them,
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.960]   you can read what other people's ideas are.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.560]   And you can see images and videos of Ford owners
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.200]   and their vehicles, and of course grab a badge,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.240]   and there's some great badges.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.120]   I probably would get the pony car badge,
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.880]   but there's lots of other ones,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.000]   including I love this, the tech geek.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.880]   You're not just ahead of the curve,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   you're the one leading it.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.840]   Get the tech geek badge.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.280]   I want this badge and put it on Twitter, Facebook,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.000]   Google+, and send it to your friends.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.840]   Add it to your email signature, I don't know.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.440]   Whatever it is the kids do with badges these days.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.000]   I'm gonna make a sash.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.840]   - Oh, there you go.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.440]   - Yeah, and embroider some badges.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   - I'm gonna make a dickie.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.080]   (laughing)
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.400]   - Whatever floats your boat, Mr. Dookam.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.240]   (laughing)
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.840]   Social.Ford, just something about the word dickie.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.680]   Just it makes you laugh.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.720]   - The kids still wear dickies?
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.560]   - No.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.400]   - Okay.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.000]   - People are watching have no idea
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.840]   what you're talking about.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.000]   - Oh no.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.920]   What's a dickie, daddy?
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.920]   (laughing)
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.280]   - Don't ask me that son.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.360]   Social.Ford.com, go there today,
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.720]   and have some fun with it.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.200]   It's really a great sight.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.000]   And by the way, the new 2013 fusions are out.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.360]   The focus is out, the escape is out.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.240]   Look at the mileage that they're getting now
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.080]   on even though with these EcoBoost engines,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.960]   even on gasoline engines, but of course the fusion.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.680]   Plug in hybrid and regular hybrid.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.000]   I mean, these just, oh, they are doing some great,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.600]   great stuff.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   Social.Ford.com, become part of the Ford Revolution.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.960]   Go further and afford.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.800]   So you got in.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.040]   - The how does a letter from a senator arrive?
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.880]   Is there a footman with a silver salver?
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.520]   I mean, what?
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.480]   - I actually got an email with an attachment.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.840]   So for people who haven't seen the article,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.920]   there it is.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.760]   This is the first spam complaint I've ever gotten
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.680]   from a Senate letterhead.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.520]   - That's cool.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.800]   - And it actually is a dress to me,
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.360]   which is, you know, so somebody knows
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.200]   the rest of the year.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.600]   - Distinguished agent title?
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.560]   - Yeah, that's my title.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.680]   Which means I've been around at Google long enough.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.520]   - Wow.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.280]   - That's so engineer, comment, Esquire.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.200]   (laughing)
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.040]   - Wow.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.520]   - So what's interesting is they did a 20 page report.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.400]   They had Senate hearings on moving company scams.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.200]   People who say it'll be $1,200.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.960]   And then once you get things loaded up,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.320]   they actually are gonna charge you $6,000.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.760]   And if you don't pay the money,
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.160]   - They got your stuff off.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   - Yeah.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.000]   And what's interesting is they were really--
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.720]   - But that's not your fault.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.120]   That's a real world scam.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.200]   - It's a real world scam.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.920]   And we try to have a very light touch.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.480]   We don't wanna be accused of being the truth police,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.400]   you know, and Google decides what's right about vaccines
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.760]   or global warming or whatever.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.200]   We try to just reflect whatever's on the web
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.800]   as best as we can in terms of relevance.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.960]   But what they did really well is they did enough research
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.720]   to find out one of these companies they called out
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.520]   and the report was scamming and spamming
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.400]   in terms of buying links and doing stuff
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.800]   that violates our government.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.640]   - Wow.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.080]   - So the good news is they've been investigating this
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.960]   for months.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.120]   It actually, we launched a search engine algorithm update
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.920]   in April called Penguin.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.000]   And Penguin tackles, among other things,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.280]   this sort of links spam.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   And so they're the traffic to this website
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.160]   actually gone down by 75% even without a selling
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.440]   that they were gonna send us a letter.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.560]   So we'd also crack down scammy link networks earlier
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.920]   this year and we'd call them in that roundup as well.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.440]   So, you know, it's really just a great spam report
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.560]   and we're gonna investigate it more
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.800]   and see if there's more we can do.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.480]   But I just love that as always,
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.600]   Google's ahead of the government.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.320]   That's the way it is.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.120]   Now, while we got you, Dr. Spam,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.120]   I've been getting, I don't know if you guys have gotten this,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.080]   I'm getting the constant barrage of what, you know,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.160]   look like fairly human, you know,
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.280]   they can spell emails saying,
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.320]   I wanna talk to you about submitting a blog post to you
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.560]   on all these various topics.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.040]   And I asked on Twitter with other people getting it
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.640]   and all the bloggers said, oh God, yeah, tons of them.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.960]   Have you seen those, Matt?
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.760]   I have, and so, you know, the spammers,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   they'll move from the easy types of spam
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.440]   to the slightly harder 'cause they try to be lazy.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.760]   So it used to be the case that guest blogging
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.080]   was a very respectable thing.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.840]   You'd hand write, you know, something really thoughtful.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.040]   There's a lot of guys who are now writing one article
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.120]   and they'll make 50 copies of it changing a few words
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.480]   and then they'll ask to do a guest post on your blog
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   and they're just doing that to try to get links.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.000]   So it's another form of link farming in effect.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.400]   But in a more legitimate way,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.520]   'cause then they're gonna get all the Google juice
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.400]   that's available from a Jeff Jarvis's blog.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.240]   - That's right.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.720]   - Sometimes they are legit.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.040]   - Yeah, sometimes they are real.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.360]   It's just a lot of the times,
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.720]   it's somebody who's writing 500 words,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   they don't know anything about it.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.920]   And they're just basically asking you for a link
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.680]   and they're gonna wrap it in some prefab text
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.520]   that they've written.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.200]   - I love that they mentioned the Cornell Gymnastics Club
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.040]   in the letter.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.240]   I don't understand that at all.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   (laughing)
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.280]   - Yeah, well, they actually, they did enough research
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.760]   to find out where they were getting links from.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   And so there's like the muscle building link forum,
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.120]   you know, and all this kind of stuff.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.760]   - Oh, so people, oh, so there are forums
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.880]   that are not moderately,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.400]   moderately, or properly moderated.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.200]   They're jammed with links.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.040]   - That's right.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.520]   And it looks like they'd also been doing a lot of paid links.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.880]   There was a link network called,
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.400]   well, you don't need to worry about the name,
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.280]   but we caught them earlier this year
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.720]   and they were participating in that.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.760]   - So this is actually great,
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.040]   'cause this means that Penguin's working.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.120]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.720]   For me, it's a good reminder that, you know,
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.240]   when we launched Penguin, there were a lot of unhappy SEOs,
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.720]   you know, and so--
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.560]   - I saw--
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.320]   - There's tons of people say, oh, right, you know,
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.120]   we're not a link farm and they'd reduced our ranking.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.480]   And, and, and, and, and we do have to be mindful
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.160]   of the impact on the scope of Google's changes.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.960]   So we do try to be very careful about that,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.720]   but it's an important reminder from across the aisle
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.640]   that there are scammers and they do try to exploit rankings
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.680]   and we have to take strong action on that.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.800]   - Actually-- - How did you respond?
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.000]   Did you write a letter or?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.080]   - I'm sure we will-- - Google plus Hangout.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.520]   - Yeah, yeah, just hop in and hang out with the senator.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.600]   We've actually already taken action on several domains.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.640]   In fact, almost a thousand domains
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.840]   because there were clear spam violations here,
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.080]   but we're gonna keep iterating and improving our algorithm
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.760]   so that hopefully we'll catch lots and lots of sites like this,
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.000]   not just the one they call out.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.840]   - The report.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.640]   - I think it's the beginning of Matt's political career.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.160]   (laughing)
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.360]   - I vote for him.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.200]   - I would.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.760]   - I'm just glad that somebody in government
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.320]   is actually paying attention to this.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.720]   I mean, it seems historically this kind of stuff gets
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.200]   kind of like, "Ah, whatever."
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.640]   Nobody pays attention to it.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.480]   Personally, I think this is a big issue
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.200]   and I'm glad that somebody in our government
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.040]   is actually taking a look at some of this stuff.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.000]   - Well, I was prepared to mock it,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.840]   but it sounds like they actually did their homework
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.080]   and this was a good report.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.680]   - And what we normally see is people
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.960]   who don't understand how search engines work, right?
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.640]   And so we talk, you guys talk about that every single week
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   and in fact, there was another story in the rundown
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.040]   about a Brazilian judge who ordered the local president
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.640]   of YouTube to be put in jail.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.800]   (laughing)
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.880]   So, it's really refreshing to see a report
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.040]   where people did their homework,
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   they understand how it works,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.600]   and then of course we want to respond to that
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.160]   and figure out how to make things better.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.760]   - Actually, Danny's-- - And Aaron, go ahead.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.800]   - You're right, the tone here was not,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.040]   oh Google's done something bad,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.280]   technology's done something bad.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.080]   It's that we want your help to get rid of these bad guys.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.400]   And that's fine, that's what it ought to be.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.400]   - Danny Sullivan says this actually is evidence
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.480]   that Penguin didn't work because these,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.240]   some of these are still in the search results.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.720]   - Yeah, it's interesting because when we started
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.440]   to dig into it, we found almost a thousand doorway domains
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.640]   belonging to this guy.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.480]   So we had affected the main site that they used,
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.680]   but we're gonna have to do some research.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.960]   Making the rank go down by three fourths is pretty good,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.520]   but those one fourth of people who are still affected
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.120]   by this particular scammer,
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.440]   that's not a great result for them.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.560]   So there's always, we're always open to constructive feedback
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.440]   and try to figure out how we can do things better.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.520]   And we're gonna definitely pour over this report
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.640]   and see what we can do better.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.160]   - It just shows these guys,
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.880]   I mean, nobody would expect you to flip one switch
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.480]   and have it all go away.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.600]   We have plenty of experience with email spam to know,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   these guys are like cockroaches.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.440]   They find, you know, just find another cravel.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.520]   - The only interesting thing here though, Leo,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.480]   is that this is a case where it ends up
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.040]   in a real world scam, you know, a physical scam.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.560]   - Yes. - And opposed to, you know,
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.160]   why are us money kind of thing?
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.880]   There's a truck at your door with big, broly guys.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.840]   - We're seeing more and more of that
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.360]   because what's happening is,
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.760]   and that's what started with those Nigerian email scams.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.400]   The con men are taking what would normally be real life cons
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.040]   and bringing them to the internet
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.920]   and finding a whole new way of exploiting people.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.400]   I was talking to a real estate agent
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.800]   about fake craigslist listings.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.320]   And I said, well, how could you fake a craigslist?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.640]   She said, what they do is they steal our listings
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.480]   with pictures and everything, create a craigslist entry,
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.920]   but say the owner is out of the country.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.600]   So what you should do is mail us some money
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.080]   and we'll mail you a key.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.800]   Or you should come to the house at three o'clock,
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.960]   I'll be there with the keys, give me the money.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.120]   And they, so they were able to get the money and skedaddle,
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.240]   but in fact, she said, this past weekend,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.400]   one of the houses they were leasing, the owner came,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.360]   and there was a family living there.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.080]   And the family said, oh no, yeah, we just rented it.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.520]   He said, no, you, what?
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.800]   No, you didn't.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.440]   I'm still showing this.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.000]   And they had gotten keys, they had gotten in,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.240]   they had moved in, they were living in the house.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.320]   - Wow.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.400]   - So, and this is, I mean, and that's a craigslist scam,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.600]   but the point is that these are,
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.560]   what would be traditional real life scams
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   just moving to the internet as everything else is.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.400]   Be aware of it.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.360]   - And you'll probably see more just earlier this month,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.120]   this guy who was working for a site called Decor My Eyes,
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.960]   his name was Viddly Porter.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.760]   - Oh, he gave, he gave it to jail.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.560]   - Good, but he gave it to jail.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.000]   - Yeah, that must have made you happy
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.400]   because he was the guy, we talked a lot about it,
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.000]   who was saying, yeah, when I yell at my customers,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.080]   it's good for my Google juice.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.360]   - Yeah, I'm really happy that that technique
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.960]   is probably not gonna be more common
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.120]   because you don't wanna get a new home for years.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.600]   - Well, and it's true, it was what happened was
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.340]   he would say horrendous things,
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.040]   and people would blog about it and post about it,
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.720]   and they put a link to his Decor My Eyes site,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.260]   and that raised his ranking, right?
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.340]   But I think you guys, we think we even had you on,
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.180]   I think at that time.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.860]   - You talked about responding.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.140]   - It turned out to be this news stories
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.200]   writing about the guy getting sued,
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.000]   that that was how he was getting the links.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.740]   It wasn't all the complaints that were helping him out,
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.840]   but nothing you could do about that.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.080]   - Hey Matt, are we gonna ever see the comeback
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.840]   of the personalized domain blocking for search results?
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.400]   - Wow, good question.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.540]   You can still, there's still a console where you can use it.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.000]   So it's not in the search results,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.340]   but there's a Chrome extension, so you can use that.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.080]   And there's also a console where you can go.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.380]   So it's just, things have to defend their pixels
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.860]   on the search results page,
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   and not enough people use it,
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.340]   then we're more likely to turn that off.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.380]   - Okay, all right.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.180]   One other question we were talking about this
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.360]   either last week or the week before,
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.400]   the Pirate Bay Auto Complete.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.700]   Is that under you?
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:20.400]   - It's in search quality, so it's not me specifically
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.180]   that worked on it, but I know some of the guys that
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.560]   were done in it. - So that is the case,
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.920]   the auto complete, when you start typing
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.880]   the Pirate Bay went away, you don't get a,
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.960]   you have to actually type the whole thing.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.720]   - And hit enter. - And hit enter.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.880]   - I think that's correct.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.760]   And the theory behind that is with auto complete
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.080]   with suggest, when you're typing something in,
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.680]   it's much more obtrusive to get up in someone's face
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.800]   and say, "Did you mean this?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.320]   Is this what you wanted to search for?"
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.360]   So if someone wants to search for X, Y, or Z,
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.000]   we return results for X, Y, or Z,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.560]   but maybe we're a little more careful
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.600]   about what we suggest.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.580]   So it's not a slippery slope, that's a little difficult
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.400]   because this wasn't the German first lady.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.920]   - The ex-president's wife.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.820]   - Who said, "Well, I don't want you to come up with
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.080]   "is a prostitute when you search for me."
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.240]   But those search results, tell us how auto complete works.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.560]   They come from other searches, right?
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.560]   - They do, they do.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.280]   And it must be really great to be a policy
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.800]   or a lawyer person at Google
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.320]   because you are on the bleeding edge
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.080]   of these kinds of issues.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.320]   But we've actually come up with some pretty good policies.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.040]   I think we're gonna try to make those more public soon.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.400]   Basically, hate speech, porn, spam.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.640]   There's a very small set of categories where we'll say,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.160]   "Okay, this is where we don't want to get up
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.080]   "in someone's face and suggest stuff
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.400]   "that they don't want to see."
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.840]   But in general, it's by looking at people's searches
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.400]   that we help learn, "Okay, that people who search for this
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.160]   "might also be searching for this."
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.360]   So here's a useful query for you to type in.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   - So I think nobody would complain at all
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.880]   if you had a very clear set of standards.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.160]   The risk, of course, is just as you said,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.760]   looking at, you want to reflect the truth of the net
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.600]   and not be editorializing about it.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.720]   So it's a very difficult line to walk.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.560]   - It is.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.920]   - You can imagine a situation in which maybe
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.520]   if there's something already in the web search results.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.200]   So maybe there's been a newspaper story
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.040]   or something like that.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.000]   So there's some evidence that this is already a controversy
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.800]   that people are talking about, this particular search.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.600]   Then it might make sense to show that search.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.640]   So we're always trying to find the right way
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.120]   to split the difference between free expression
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.280]   and trying to give people all the information they need
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.720]   and still be responsible to.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.120]   - Very tricksy.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.200]   Very difficult thing to do.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.720]   - Google News, 10 years old.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.560]   - 10 years.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.640]   - They had to believe they held a party with a cake.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.560]   - Because Google itself is only like 12 years old, right?
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.640]   - So 14.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.960]   - 14 now, wow.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.080]   Wow.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.280]   Google News was launched September 22nd, 2002.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.960]   And I've been using it religiously ever since.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.320]   - Yep.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.360]   - I heard the online news association in San Francisco.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.520]   They held a party.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.960]   So Christian Barat, the founder of it,
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.880]   Richard Jinger versus in charge now, were there.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.840]   And we had pot stickers and cake in the San Francisco office.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.680]   - Wasn't it?
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.840]   - Wasn't it controversial, Jeff, originally that--
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.680]   - Yes.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.040]   - You could algorithmically determine news.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.360]   - It was controversial a few ways, right?
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.800]   That was one, oh my God, what happens to editors?
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.560]   And then controversial, of course, in the other way,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.720]   of saying this is stealing our soul
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.280]   about taking pictures, right?
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.440]   - That's still new, that's still happening today.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.160]   - It's not on the rundown.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.120]   And I love this story.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.600]   Rupert Murdoch, who called Google parasites
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.200]   and stopped looking into us, pulled the stuff
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.960]   from the Times of London,
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.840]   where he purposely a wall from Google,
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.160]   just meekly just came back and now allows Google
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.440]   to put up headlines and snippets
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.880]   because he needs them.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.640]   He needs the eggs.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.600]   - Interesting.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.520]   'Cause that was the issue, it's like, yeah, okay.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.280]   So the snippets are there, but it links to your properties,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.800]   Rupert, well, it's not like--
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.640]   - Exactly.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.520]   So it's a great timing too, because right now,
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.640]   for Google's sake, right now in Germany,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.960]   as I think I mentioned, we have a high potential law
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.000]   called a "Lysstungs Schutzrecht",
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.600]   an ancillary copyright going in,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   which would require Google and other aggregators
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.200]   to pay for snippets and headlines.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   That notion is spreading to France, I'm crazy.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.880]   So in the meantime, right now, Murdoch,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.120]   the greatest Google hater there was out there,
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.400]   and now comes crawling back with his tail
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.520]   between his legs, which is where it is these days,
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.440]   most of the time.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.000]   - It's essentially an acknowledgement that we,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.280]   it costs us traffic. - Yeah.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.800]   - Cost us traffic. - Even with a paywall.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.160]   Even with a paywall.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.000]   So he stole a set of people to a wall,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.600]   so it's not really an advertising strategy,
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.160]   but he needs subscriber acquisition.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.520]   And the times is completely unseen in the conversation.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.800]   Now, you don't even know what comes up,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.160]   and it has anything to contribute to a cluster of news.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.680]   So he had to be back in there, which is kind of beautiful.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.400]   - Yeah, I like that, that was pretty good.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.800]   And it really is all about eyeballs.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.760]   I mean, people aren't noticing anymore.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.880]   When it's not there, people don't notice.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.280]   They don't see it. - Yeah, good luck
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.240]   having them find you.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.520]   - Whether you're making them pay for it or not,
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.120]   if they don't see it, then eventually,
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.520]   everybody's gonna be paying for it.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.240]   - You're right, Aaron, and you can get it back
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.160]   into Google search, but what you're not gonna get it back
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.440]   into is Twitter, or Facebook, or Google Plus,
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.600]   because you're not gonna...
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.440]   - If you send someone to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.600]   at least it's a porous paywall,
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   the New York Times is a porous paywall.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.440]   New York Times has a set up
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.400]   so that any links will come through the article.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.720]   But at the times of London, nothing does.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.880]   - Yeah. - So I'm gonna...
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.800]   - Yeah, I see it is, you gotta pay.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.640]   - I'm not gonna link to it.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.160]   - And send Wall Street Journal too, right?
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.320]   I mean, you...
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.480]   - It's not as steel as it has some porosity.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.280]   - You see an excerpt, and I guess Google search
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.000]   or Google News gets you the full article.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.160]   - An FTE, oh, they took that out.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.400]   - They took that out. - They took that out.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.960]   - But FFT, you can get to some number of articles
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   a month, like the Times.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   - Now, contrast this, I don't know if you read
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.120]   David Carr's piece about David Bradley,
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.480]   the owner of Atlantic Media in the New York Times.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.080]   Really interesting story.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.880]   Bradley thought that it'd be money to make in magazines.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.920]   (laughing)
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.760]   So...
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.800]   - Let me look at dollars later.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   - He bought the Atlantic, and he says it was expensive
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.480]   and painful.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.000]   I clearly did not know what I was getting into.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.840]   He wanted to buy Newsweek, couldn't get it,
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.800]   so he bought the Atlantic in 1998,
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.120]   along with the National Journal
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.560]   and Government Executive magazine.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.720]   So, fast forward, took 14 years later,
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.880]   and he's doing basically web business, right?
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.720]   - It's doing great.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.520]   He hired a, I think the most brilliant business side guy
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.240]   in magazines in the US named Justin Smith,
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.640]   who was responsible for the launch of the week.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.160]   And Justin's been on a high-end digital first view
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.120]   where he's pushed Atlantic online, made really,
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.040]   Atlantic- - You can read the entire magazine online.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.160]   - It's great stuff that they just started,
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.600]   well, they just started this week, Quartz,
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.320]   which is a new QZ.com, which is a new financial,
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.400]   new service for the hire.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.880]   - Also free.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.120]   - Be very, very good, just to be getting up,
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.440]   but really, really good.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.680]   And there's a great quote toward the end of that article, Leo,
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.880]   where Bradley says that digital Trump's print
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.960]   and 100% digital Trump's print.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.800]   And I think it's a really important way,
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.160]   which again goes against the religion
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.400]   of the Murdochs of the world,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.600]   who wanna hold on, or the Columbia Journalism Review,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.240]   who wanna hold on to the old models.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.200]   And Justin Smith with Bradley's backing
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.640]   created a new model in the Atlantic,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.080]   and now they're expanding it with Quartz,
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.480]   and I imagine they will in other areas.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.040]   Now what they do is they go to very high-end advertising.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.400]   They sell high-end advertising.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.880]   - Quartz has Boeing, Cadillac, Chevron, and Credit Suisse.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.560]   And they've bought it out through the end of the year,
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.880]   by the way.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.160]   They also create a scarcity that way.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.120]   We have a high-end audience, we have a lot of sorts.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.640]   - Very important.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.080]   - And it's really good to see digital winning.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.520]   It's not just good for my, you know,
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.840]   me and the end of the year points.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.840]   It's good because it's the future of media,
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.440]   and it's good to see some success stories.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.360]   - Well, and they've been profitable three years running.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.200]   - That's the key.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.960]   - They were losing money, handover fist,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.240]   and they are now profitable.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.280]   By giving it away, free ad supported media.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.920]   I think this is, when I read this article,
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.280]   I couldn't wait to bring it up with you, Jeff,
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.000]   'cause it's just, it's such good news.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.480]   - Yes, it really is.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.920]   - It's a good David Carr column, very good one.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.760]   - Yeah.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.480]   - And yeah, maybe Rupert should read this.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.080]   (laughing)
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.200]   I haven't looked at courts yet, is it good?
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.040]   - It's very good.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.200]   QZ.com, if you want to take a quick look at it.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.000]   - It's a great URL, how do you get that?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.560]   Huh, wow.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.400]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.240]   - I bought that for myself.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.640]   - QTZ?
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.720]   QTZ.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.640]   - QZ, two letters.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.920]   - QZ, oh, there it is.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.640]   Very simple looking.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.080]   - It's straightforward blog with good coding across.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.520]   Part of what the editors have said
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.600]   is they don't have beats, they have obsessions.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.440]   - Yeah.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.960]   - They've been going on right now, they'll dig in.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.120]   - Can I just point out this is our model,
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.000]   and this is what we've learned,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.600]   that works in that supported media.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.720]   Do your passion, do your obsession.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.160]   That's what people want to read.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.520]   They want to read somebody who's like so involved in this,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.480]   that they know everything right and let their walks.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.440]   - They hired some of the best and brightest young folks.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.280]   - Yeah.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.400]   - Interesting.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.560]   - Back to Edward and others.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.600]   - Yeah.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.400]   Nate Silver interview.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.320]   - Former head of,
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.320]   um,
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.640]   digital at the economist.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.040]   - Very interesting stuff.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.880]   All right.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.880]   Moving on, let's see what's next.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.880]   Let's take a break and then come back with a,
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.720]   a little bit more.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.360]   Have you seen Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.480]   around the campus, by the way, Matt?
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.200]   - Uh, I can neither conform or deny
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.120]   that I should see Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn at the campus.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.720]   - Are you signed to an NDA or something?
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.600]   - You know, it was funny.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.960]   I, I did apply to be an extra,
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.640]   but yeah, 'cause I thought that would be funny
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.960]   for all the SEOs,
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.720]   but my parents were visiting and so I wasn't able
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.360]   to do much time and so they were like,
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.960]   yeah, we don't really need you.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.800]   Thank you.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.880]   - They're making a movie called The Internship
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.680]   and they got permission.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.520]   We talked about this last week,
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   permission to use the Google campus as the set,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.920]   which I think is fantastic.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.960]   It makes me want to see the movie.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.080]   - It's about what it's about two, two grown guys
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.680]   who get an internship.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.520]   - Yeah.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.480]   And I guess Google is kind of a very youthful place
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   and so how do they fit in, you know,
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.800]   pitch out of water, sort of story.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.640]   - So is that Google?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.280]   It's not like some, you know, fake internet company.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.520]   It's Google?
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.480]   - Well, they made up Georgia Tech to look like Google
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.000]   for most of their scenes,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.720]   but then they did use the courtyard
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.600]   and some of the outdoor areas of Google
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.280]   for just a few days of filming, I think.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.200]   - And I guess Vince Vaughn,
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.560]   Eric Schmidt interviewed Vince Vaughn at an employee talk
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.480]   and Hugo Barra among others have been extras.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.320]   - You can see in the bus picture,
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.760]   they splashed a huge Google logo on that bus
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.960]   in that picture and it's pretty fun to look at
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.200]   something that's even more googly.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.520]   Like they add more Google logos than we have.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.600]   (laughing)
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.040]   More Google.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.720]   - That's hysterical.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.160]   And they're all wearing 49ers hats,
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.960]   it looks like they had a 49ers game.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.860]   That's awesome.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:04.000]   Oops.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.360]   So let's, I want to also show the picture of Sergey.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:12.040]   As long as we're, as long as we're a star.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:12.880]   - Going after the star power.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.720]   - Star power.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:18.280]   Sergey at the signing of the autonomous vehicle,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.680]   Bill in California.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.400]   It was Sergey Brin and Jerry Brown.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.440]   So maybe if I Google,
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.320]   "Sergate Brin and Jerry Brown."
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.960]   And Matt, if you could flip the switch
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.200]   that makes that search result come up
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.320]   with exactly what I want.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.560]   - Oh, he did, look at that.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   There we go. - Wow.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.880]   Can you tell me that that's not the weirdest looking thing
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.720]   you've ever seen?
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.560]   I don't know.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.720]   - Which Jerry Brown or?
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.560]   - No.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.880]   - That's what Jerry, Jerry Brown.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.120]   It looks like a governor.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.520]   What is I,
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:51.400]   I think it was smart of the guys to do the New York Fashion Week
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   'cause I'd much rather see pictures
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.280]   of the Google Glass on really attractive people
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.680]   and slope like eight or something like that.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.600]   I don't know if this is selling it, frankly.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.800]   I don't know if this is selling it.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.240]   Look at Jerry, are people gonna walk around?
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.560]   Sergey looks demented.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.840]   - Well, I think as long as it's compelling enough,
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.160]   as far as functionality,
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.880]   you know, like you'll start with the geeks and other people.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.720]   - It looks like Locketis.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.480]   Now, if it had been Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.640]   when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor,
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.240]   then it would just be okay, you know.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.080]   - Right.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:27.920]   - Yeah, fits right in.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.760]   - It fits right in.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.400]   We got Terminator and Locketis, but it just tastes--
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.080]   - I also like the, I like the Iliya Koryakan outfit.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:34.920]   - Yes.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.760]   - The reference most of your audience will not guess.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.520]   - He's wearing a t-shirt, a collarless shirt.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.520]   - He does look like Iliya Koryakan.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.400]   - It's like a spy, yeah.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.000]   - I guess when you're, when you're Sergey,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   you can pretty much do whatever you want, you know.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.960]   Like we'll make jokes that he's like, you know,
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.400]   Batman, billionaire, industrialist,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   build school gadgets, all that sort of stuff.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.760]   - He is this, yeah, exactly.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.160]   It's stark, stark enterprises.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.000]   - Yeah.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.240]   - You can, you can not answer this if you don't want.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.560]   It's by Locketis, thank you, I'm sorry.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.400]   - I'm sorry.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.880]   And it would be pronounced no Kiotis of born.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.160]   If you miss pronounced, and I don't think
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.800]   that's correct, but it's the Asian.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   (laughing)
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.800]   - Feremno Kiotis.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.640]   (laughing)
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.080]   Perhaps you didn't see episode 48 when they.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.920]   - And you can, you can recuse yourself on this one,
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.840]   but we are seeing a lot of Sergey,
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.280]   but we're not seeing much of Larry.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.760]   What's going on with Larry?
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.640]   - He's doing well.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.280]   He's actively back at CEO, he's got his voice back.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.120]   - He's talking.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.440]   - Oh yeah.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.560]   - Oh good.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.400]   So he's, you know, he's still, you know,
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.640]   at the reins of the company doing CEO stuff.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.000]   - And doing it apparently well,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   but we'll get to that later.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.840]   - Yeah.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.840]   - He's doing a great job.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.560]   I just, that's what, but last we'd heard he'd lost his voice.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.880]   He was still running the company with his voice,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.240]   so I'm glad to hear his voices back.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.080]   That's good.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.920]   - Yeah.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.600]   And the funny thing about that story is I looked
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   at the courtyard and I saw a self-driving car parked.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.040]   I was like, that's weird, they're normally moving around.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.680]   Turns out it was because they parked them
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.920]   for the signing ceremony.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.760]   So.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.440]   - That's pretty cool.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.880]   - I saw my first self-driving SUV
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.120]   when I went to the Google campus.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.040]   - Wow.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.000]   - Yeah, they got those Lexuses, right?
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.840]   - Yeah.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.680]   - Yeah.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.400]   - I saw Jeff tweet it and then I was like,
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.400]   "Oh, Jeff must be in the area, but then I missed you."
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.120]   So, you know, sorry.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:13.960]   It's all good.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.120]   - I was talking to the Google+ people.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.400]   - Do you have a Google Glass?
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.320]   Do you ever wear yours?
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.040]   So the problem is with my current glasses, you know,
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.720]   it would make it a little bit more tricky.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.680]   I certainly would love to play with them,
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.720]   but, you know, it might take a little while longer
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.920]   to handle it if you're a subscription.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.760]   - Guy with glasses, yeah.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.880]   - I'm 58 years old.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.800]   It'll probably make me go get contacts for the first time.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.640]   - Uh-huh. - Yeah.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.920]   - Uh-huh. - There you go.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.760]   - I'm wondering if, by the way,
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.040]   they say the irony of me making fun of nerds
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.680]   is just out of control.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.200]   (laughing)
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.960]   You are a king nerd, Sire.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.440]   - Big Jim said the irony fairy just passed out.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.280]   (laughing)
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.080]   - It's pronounced laccudously a laccudus of Borg.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.720]   Perhaps you didn't know.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.480]   - Are they, how long before Google says that
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.640]   when you show up in public, Matt, you have to wear a glass?
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.280]   (laughing)
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.920]   - You know, if they would give it to me,
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.080]   I would put it on right now.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.240]   - All right. - If it could go on
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.320]   over the glasses and everything.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.160]   - He's not resisting.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.520]   - No. - Oh, no.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.160]   - And I wouldn't work my life.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.800]   - I'm number 747, and I would gladly,
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.520]   I will wear them on the show.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.800]   - On the show?
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.640]   - Just send them along.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.040]   People would love to watch through your eyes
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:29.880]   as you do that on the show.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.520]   - Yeah, I wonder if you can hook that into the,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.600]   hook that into the system and--
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.440]   - I am Leo Cutis. - Switch over to Borg.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.440]   Switch to Leo's glasses now.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.700]   (laughing)
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:42.800]   - Leo Cam. - Leo Cutis.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.240]   Am I saying that right now?
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.360]   I don't watch that show.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.840]   What is that show, Star Trek?
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.640]   Never heard of it.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:53.480]   - Stay.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.440]   - I would not do an ad right now.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.600]   - I guess I won't point out my tesure.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.440]   - Hey, bad thing.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.800]   - What does that say, Darmox and Jalad at,
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.960]   is that Star Wars stuff?
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.800]   - This is a geek test.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.000]   Yeah, this is Star Wars.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.600]   Or is it episode of Star Wars where they--
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.800]   - We're trapped on the planet, him and this alien.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.080]   The universal translator wasn't working.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.680]   They had to communicate by metaphor.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.360]   - At Tanagra. - And I'm saying that right.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.800]   - That's right, you've got an A-gr-
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.200]   - Hey, you pronounced it correctly.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   So, Darmox and Gila added to A-gr-
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.240]   - They can't, they can't pounce on you for that.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.760]   (laughing)
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.840]   - Wow. - If you had the glasses,
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.680]   you could Google that with him and not knowing
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.920]   that we're searching for it.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.240]   - So that's what I needed. - See, that's what I needed.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.560]   - Yeah, yeah, 'cause if I--
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.160]   - I would have no idea.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.760]   So really, you'd have to be a real nerd
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.960]   to know what that was.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.560]   - Yup, I'm raising my hand now.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.240]   That's me, I'm a real nerd.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.560]   - Yeah.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.400]   - Real nerd.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.280]   (laughing)
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.800]   - Would you have got that one, Matt?
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.200]   - With the help of Google, I would have.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.800]   (laughing)
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.000]   - Man, you're over my head.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.480]   Although I have to say, I'm wearing my novelty tesures.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   - Let's see, oh, it's redacted.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.600]   - Oh, that's a good one.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.960]   - It's the ice water. - It's the ice water.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   - So good, I'm all I got was the stupid tesures.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.400]   (laughing)
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   - I do like that.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.240]   - I like it.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.080]   - I do like that.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.320]   - That's great.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.400]   - Is that from TNG?
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.480]   No, it's from Star Wars.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.720]   - No, this is from TNG.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.600]   - Oh. - Yup.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.440]   TNG.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.320]   - That's why, 'cause I missed that whole series,
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.200]   that whole season, that's whatever.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.040]   - Yup. - It was.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.000]   - Gone.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.640]   - Google responded, this was a very sloppy,
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.320]   I think, article in The New York Times about
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.200]   the cost of data centers.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.600]   In which they kind of accused the internet
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.560]   of being the problem and then talked about
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.160]   a bunch of privately run data centers,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.120]   like Nexus Nexus from the 18th century.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.520]   - Right.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.720]   - And I think, in fact, a lot of people
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.440]   who respond to this article has been pretty much
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.160]   roundly excoriated.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.120]   - My favorite was a tweet from Chris Sokka,
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.840]   who's a former Googler who said,
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   "Actually, Google's efficiency is approaching
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.360]   the theoretical limits more so though."
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.120]   - It is not. - And we do care
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:02.960]   about efficiency.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.240]   - It is not a bad point to make that
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.600]   the electrical cost of using the internet
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.160]   doesn't stop with your personal power bill,
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.760]   that when you go out on the net
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.760]   and you're using servers, those servers are plugged in too.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.440]   So that's appropriate, I think, to let people know that.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.480]   But the good news is just as centralizing power production
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.240]   in power plants makes them more efficient.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.600]   With companies like Facebook and Google,
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.680]   where this is an Apple too, where it's a huge part
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   of their cost, they pay a lot of attention
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.040]   to making these as efficient as possible.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.760]   - And buying wind power and spending a fortune
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.800]   on alternative power and trying to figure that out.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.640]   And there's never a legitimate comparison
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   to the old world ways and how, you know,
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.520]   not driving into the library to get the book
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.040]   that was over there by a truck.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.440]   - That's a good point.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.600]   - It's a classic New York Times kind of trend,
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.800]   effort for a trend story.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.560]   There's a great, I recommend this highly,
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.480]   there's a great Twitter account called NYT on it.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.320]   - I love it.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.480]   - It makes fun of all of the trend stories.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.040]   So this one always starts this way.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.440]   Guys, apparently it takes a lot of energy
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.840]   to power the internet and the Times is on.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.360]   (laughing)
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.520]   - The earlier one I love this.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.480]   - Guys, turns out not drinking soda
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.400]   is much better for you than drinking soda
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.200]   and the Times is on it.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.120]   - That's funny.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.280]   - Guys, some New Yorkers live in really small apartments
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.760]   and the Times is on all stuff.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.120]   - It is very, it is very, very funny.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:24.960]   - It does.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.840]   (laughing)
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.520]   - It's almost as good as that horse account.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.960]   What is the name of that one?
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.360]   That is so funny.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.200]   - Yeah.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.840]   - A e-book, horse e-books.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.040]   You've seen that one, right?
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.920]   I haven't seen that one.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.240]   This is a spam account, I think.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.280]   - I kind of feel like it is, yeah.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.720]   - Is it horse underscore e-books?
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.560]   Is that what it is?
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.560]   I can't remember, yeah.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.400]   - Yeah.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.440]   - It's unclear what's going on here,
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.160]   but it's the funniest kind of non-sequitur
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.560]   and you see they have 110,000 followers
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.800]   because you just read their tweets and like here's one,
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.520]   you that you could be destroying
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.560]   and preventing these pests
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.320]   from your beautiful organic garden within hours after
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.560]   or what can you do about it?
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.080]   But see, every once in a while there's a link.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.960]   See, that's why I think it's a spammer.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.280]   Vegetables are tender, turning.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.960]   In 1992 I innovated.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.560]   - Or wrong.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.520]   Then every once in a while there's a little link.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.200]   So I can only think that there's something going on here.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.800]   - I'm sure it's the exact same number,
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.840]   interval number, right?
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.240]   - Yeah, sticker sticker sticker sticker, yes, no, yes, no, yes,
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.920]   no, yay, yay, registration, yes, yay, and sticker.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   Why are people following this though?
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.360]   'Cause it's hysterical.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.800]   How about this one?
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.720]   My husband was fed up with our cat peeing on his clothes,
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.080]   only his and we had tried.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.960]   This is to have to do this with mat cuts in the room
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.320]   is like lionizing a criminal in a convention of cops.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.880]   - Oh, oh.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.200]   - And then they have earn on click bank ebooks
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.040]   and it's not as much.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.440]   - I'm sure that's what it is.
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:59.720]   I never really understood that even the concept of spam
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.360]   in an ecosystem like Twitter
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   where you actively have to follow somebody,
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.800]   but it works somehow.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.640]   Yeah, here it is, earn on click bank ebooks.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.360]   So that's the spam right there.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.960]   Hidden, buried deep within things
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.320]   like sweet recipes and become a bail.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.440]   Okay, enough of that.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.280]   Now I can talk about stamps.com.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   I have sanitized the stream from my nerdiness.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.600]   Stamps.com, actually this is a little nerdy.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.000]   It's on demand postage.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.680]   I mean, okay, and the reason that stamps.com
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.320]   loves doing ads on the Twit Network
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.080]   is 'cause they know you guys get it.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.360]   You don't wanna go to the post office,
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.480]   you have a computer, you have a printer,
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.200]   wouldn't be cool if you could use your computer printer
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.520]   to print postage.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.080]   Now you can't print US money yet,
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.560]   but you can print official US postage.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.960]   It's kinda cool with stamps.com.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.040]   If you can try it, I'll have to give you
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.120]   a numerous trial offer in just a second.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.160]   There are many advantages to doing this.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.560]   For one thing, it's on demand postage.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.480]   Wake up in the middle of the night
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.720]   and you wanna mail something, you can.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.840]   Bond demand, but it's also a great way to save.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.800]   You get discounts, you can't get at the post office.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.680]   21% or more even on Express mail.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.200]   Priority mail up to 15%.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.560]   They get international mail, they've got discounts.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.640]   You can't get those at the post office.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.000]   You can mail stuff via stamps.com
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.160]   that you have to go to the post office to mail normally.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.880]   The post office, anything over 13 ounces,
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.240]   you can't throw in a mailbox.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.200]   If you could find one, they took all our mailboxes out.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.000]   Have you, there's no more mail,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.040]   have you, can you know where, there's no more mailboxes
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:38.880]   at Petaluma?
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.000]   I found one and you know where they put it?
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.760]   Where? Next to the post office?
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.200]   Well, no, next to the city hall.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.360]   'Cause all the people in the city hall,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.120]   they were like, well, we're taking them all out of the city,
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.440]   except for ours.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.400]   There are no mailboxes.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.320]   That's so they can mail their parking tickets
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.120]   'cause I got one for $48.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.120]   Oh.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.640]   (laughing)
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.400]   Maybe that's it.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.840]   Sorry, sorry about that.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.000]   When you were here, you got a $48 ticket?
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.360]   All of the good cause, Leo.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.200]   All of the good cause.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.040]   We'll take care of it.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:06.880]   We'll take care of it.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.120]   I'll be glad to take care of it.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.440]   You know what, you don't even have to do that.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.120]   Just tweet the ticket serial number and I'll pay it.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.600]   No, seriously.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.440]   Kickstarter.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   Yeah, well do a little Kickstarter.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.600]   What Leo was really saying is he has pole city hall in him.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.480]   No, I have no pole.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.520]   I have no pole city.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.680]   If I did, I'd have a mailbox,
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.680]   but no, I have stamps.com instead.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.560]   The beauty of this is they come and get it.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.120]   You don't need a mailbox, they come and get it.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.760]   No matter what size the package is,
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.040]   you also get a great USB scale as part of the offer for free.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.320]   So that you can, it's up to 25 pounds.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.360]   Plop your letter or you never have to put,
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.960]   do you ever put more stamps on a package just so you,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   'cause you don't know what it weighs
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.640]   and you hope it gets there?
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.040]   You're throwing money away.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.480]   You'll never do that again with stamps.com.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   Plus it looks cool.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.320]   You can have it print your logo, whatever,
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.320]   any image you want for the stamp.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.040]   In fact, it'll print the whole envelope out.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.280]   Takes the addresses from QuickBooks.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.280]   If you're an eBay Amazon or Etsy seller,
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.240]   it'll take the data from those pages
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.120]   when you have to mail the product.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   It's great if you're an Etsy,
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.920]   this you have to have a stamps account.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.320]   So go to stamps.com right now.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.480]   Now let me show you the deal here.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.760]   If you see there in the upper right hand corner,
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.320]   don't take the $80 deal.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.960]   That's not good enough for you.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.440]   No, no, no, upper right hand corner,
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.760]   click that microphone or where it says click here.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   And then enter Twig, T-W-I-G and click go.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.840]   And that $80 offers now $110 bonus offer,
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.920]   $55 a free postage.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.000]   The digital scale is yours.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.840]   You pay shipping and handling, which I think is five bucks.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.800]   It's a $50 scale.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.960]   They'll give you a $5 supply kit to kind of make up for that.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.520]   And a four week trial free.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.280]   And if you can cancel at any time,
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.120]   you don't have to pay a thing,
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.240]   but you can keep the scale forever.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.520]   I think you're gonna wanna stick with it.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.880]   stamps.com, it's the post office comes to you.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.680]   It's fantastic.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.120]   Stamps.com, what are you doing going to the post office?
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.040]   Now that's wasteful.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.240]   That's wasting energy.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.280]   You're worried about the Google network centers.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.120]   This is waste, drive in the post office.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.960]   That's wasteful.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.480]   Google Play, I just saw this stat this morning.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   25 billion downloads.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.320]   Is that your number?
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.160]   I hope not, Jeff.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.000]   It's okay.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.840]   I got another one.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.680]   (laughing)
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.840]   I took Aaron's tip earlier, but did it quickly.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.720]   I talked so fast, nobody will remember it.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.200]   Yeah, so they're offering a bunch of 25 cent apps
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.360]   right now as a promotion.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.120]   Oh cool, awesome.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:24.960]   I should go.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.800]   The numbers now are so big.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.080]   It's kind of 25 billion.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.920]   25 billion.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.800]   Wow.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.880]   That's amazing.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.520]   I think there are, it says 675,000 apps.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.680]   They're getting very close to iOS, which I think is 750.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.200]   You know, what'd you guess?
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.040]   That's fine.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.960]   After a few hundred thousand, the difference makes no difference.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.760]   All I was missing, as far as I was concerned,
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.240]   what I use on my beloved Nexus 7 was HBO to go
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.560]   and Showtime to go.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.240]   I now have HBO to go.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.760]   I'm waiting for Showtime.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.560]   And then I'm good, I got it.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.920]   Hey, as long as we're talking about that,
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.720]   this is the Kindle Fire HD.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.640]   Same size as the next 7.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.800]   It's a little cheaper if you compare RAM.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.040]   It's 200 bucks for the 16 gig version.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.000]   And they have a 32 gig.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.320]   Although nowadays, I'm not RAM storage,
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.400]   doesn't seem that important because frankly,
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.520]   almost everything you're doing on here is streaming.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.040]   And it is Android, but you never know that.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.400]   I'll tell you, it's that weird Amazon interface,
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.280]   which I've now somehow done something with and I'm lost.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.120]   Oh, there we go.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:28.960]   There's the New York Times.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.200]   You know, it's fine.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.320]   The whole equation is changed by the Nexus 7
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.920]   because the Nexus 7 is roughly the same price.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.280]   And it's Jelly Bean.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.720]   And it's Un--
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.560]   How about the Nook?
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.920]   Is the Nook also Dn-related?
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.120]   They just now announced their new Nook,
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.600]   which is definitely a competitor to the Kindle Fire HD.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.000]   And it also has the, it's highly tailored for Barnes & Noble.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.200]   I mean, they're starting up to new businesses.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.440]   It is as de-googled as--
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.520]   Oh, yes.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.160]   Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.240]   'Cause they're doing the same thing
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.880]   that Amazon's trying to do, right?
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.480]   They're trying to drive business.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.400]   So they're starting up new magazine business
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.480]   and video business to try to get people
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.080]   to drive business back to them.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.400]   But I think people like it.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.680]   I mean, it looks like technology-wise,
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.520]   it looks like a very good competitor
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.680]   to the Kindle tablet.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.520]   So--
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.760]   Everybody who's watching this show
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.160]   would be buying a Nexus 7.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.320]   And we'd be buying a Nexus 7.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320]   You'd say, right, yeah.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.760]   'Cause I use it as my Kindle.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.600]   It's a wonderful thing, but I get so much more.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   My mom is addicted.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.040]   I got her one just right after Google--
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   The Nexus 7.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:40.880]   A Nexus 7.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.520]   And she's like, I will not use a tablet.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   I will not use a tablet.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.880]   I don't like these things.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.320]   And so I said, ah, you know what?
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.160]   I'm gonna give her one.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.520]   If she doesn't like it, she can send it to me,
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.720]   'cause I'll definitely use it.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.600]   So I gave her one and she is hooked.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.040]   She keeps telling me, I'm so glad you--
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.040]   I take it everywhere.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:54.560]   I use it.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.760]   I play the silly ball game.
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.520]   I love it.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.560]   So, you know, she's hooked.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.080]   She's 70 years old and she loves it.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.080]   So--
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.720]   Oops, I shouldn't have said her age.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.440]   My mom's turning 80 in January,
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:05.680]   but she's an iPad user.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.160]   I just said her the new iPad 3.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.040]   The browser, somebody asked me how about the browser.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.480]   It's not as, you know, it's like not as quite chrome.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.200]   The silk browser supposedly is cashing in as faster.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.880]   I don't see that at all.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.000]   Let's load in October Fest Feast.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.560]   You know, I mean, guess it's pretty fast.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.320]   It's, you know, I can't see any reason to get this
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.640]   unless you're so hooked into the Amazon ecosystem.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.440]   And I bet you that's the same thing for the Nook.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.840]   If you're so hooked into the Barnes and Noble ecosystem,
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.000]   that you really want to just live there, you know?
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.680]   I've been meaning to read the privacy policy,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.560]   'cause I wonder if you went and just looked at an article
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.480]   about October Fest, are you gonna see recipes?
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.920]   Are you gonna see a cookbook in your recommendation soon?
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.840]   That will be interesting.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   Well, I'll let you know, 'cause that's what I just did.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.480]   I looked at it at a October Fest recipe.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.640]   You do get offers, you can pay to get the offers off,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.480]   but it's not a big deal.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.720]   You saw it after when I launched, it's not a big deal.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:03.280]   It's, but the point is the Nexus 7 is all that and more.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.000]   Yes.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.960]   So I just don't see any compelling reason since you can't get,
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.240]   there's a, okay, I'll give you one reason.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.080]   There's one thing you can do on this,
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.200]   and it's very, you know, it's very nerdy.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.360]   If you're reading a book that you have
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.480]   the equivalent audio book for,
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.040]   so this is an Agatha Christie book
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.920]   that Amazon was offering for free.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.760]   When the audio book, what it sees,
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:28.440]   it puts the audio here, I could press play,
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.120]   and it will narrate the audio book and highlight the text
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.040]   as it's reading, I have to turn it down.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.640]   Like, turn it up.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.280]   So as it's reading, it highlights the text that it's reading.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.640]   I don't know of any other device that you can do that on.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.440]   I mean, that's, I don't know also.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.560]   No, this would be good, I guess,
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.120]   for kids learning to read, or maybe a dyslexic or something,
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.440]   but it does have that, everybody,
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.760]   every audible has the whisper sync thing.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.960]   And if you're reading a book,
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.720]   it will automatically jump to you to that part
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.520]   of the audio book so you can listen on from there.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.520]   X-ray, that was a unique thing.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.800]   So this is wild, actually.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.400]   I didn't, I've never done this before.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.120]   So there's four characters mentioned on that page,
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.480]   and I can see all the places they show up in the book.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.320]   Now that's kind of wild.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.160]   And it's kind of wild.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.600]   The digital humanists will go to,
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.960]   maybe digital, what they call it,
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.400]   digital humanism, digital, what are all the references
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.600]   to Mrs. Cavendish.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.640]   Would that be good in a text?
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.080]   Like a text?
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:27.920]   Maybe.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.960]   You know, for college and stuff.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   It would be good for porn.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.240]   Oh, oh, that's a good idea.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.320]   Okay, let's see.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.200]   Here's all the places where Pony Play occurred.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   Okay, I, wow, that's, here's the good parts.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.240]   Yeah, anyway, get the Nexus 7.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.080]   Yeah, get the Nexus 7.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.360]   There's just no question about it.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.360]   Unless you're watching audio porn or something.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.520]   The X-ray is kind of interesting.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.120]   It's a little distracting, you're watching a movie,
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.400]   and it says, here's who's in the movie,
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.000]   and you tap it and you stop the movie
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.400]   and you can read their bio.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.280]   It's kind of, I think that's kind of an interesting thing.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.760]   Why don't they link that to,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.880]   have they linked it to products yet?
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.040]   I am DB, well maybe I'm--
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040]   When you're watching a video,
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.840]   if they zoom in on somebody's shoes,
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.680]   like the matter of fact--
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.440]   The matter of fact, I think that that does happen.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.240]   You're not one of those great holy grails
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.920]   that everyone talks about and that never arrives.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.520]   Well, if anybody's gonna do it, it's gonna be Amazon.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.040]   Yeah, they're best positioned.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.400]   The Zappos layer.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.280]   Let me see if this is, I was watching a movie.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.400]   Now it's probably, has it expired?
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.240]   Oh yeah, 'cause it's instant, so instant prime.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.320]   Now I have to buy it, I don't wanna rent the Avengers.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.560]   I was watching a movie
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.600]   and pick up where you left off.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.760]   Okay, where did I leave off?
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.200]   I wasn't watching that.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.280]   Huh, I don't know where it's getting these movies,
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.760]   but it thinks I like red shoe diaries.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.760]   I don't, judging from the cover, I think I might actually.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.320]   No, I never, I don't know what, whoa, go, stop.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.680]   I pressed, I tapped it by accident.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.960]   The chat room says 50 shades of gray.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.800]   It's $20.99.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.560]   Okay, let me find something so I can hear.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.080]   Super 8 is on free.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.560]   So if I watch it, it will pop up.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.200]   I'll just show you, it's a long way to go
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.920]   to show you this silly thing, but as you watch the credits,
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.000]   you see there's the X-ray, see full cast.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.920]   You hit it and then you're gonna get an IMDB.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.240]   I think that's, I mean, it kind of reflects how people,
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.320]   I often do that, I'll say, oh, who was that?
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.240]   What was he in?
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.840]   Especially since you have your devices
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840]   in your living room now.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.680]   Right.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.200]   A lot of times I'm watching a movie, I'll pause it
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.800]   and then bring up my tablet or my laptop
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.200]   and type in IMDB or, you know, oh, I remember that person.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.520]   What else was she in, you know?
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:56.440]   So this person's on screen, so it's showing his bio.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.800]   Oh, group shot.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.320]   So whatever happened to that kid,
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.640]   did he ever have a career or was that it?
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.120]   That kind of thing.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.720]   Oh, I think that, I think this is,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.480]   and you're right, I think the future of this
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.360]   and I'm sure Amazon's prepping for it is,
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.640]   oh, I'd like to buy that T-shirt.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.800]   Right, right.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.880]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.960]   That would be actually.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.800]   Oh, wouldn't mind that?
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.400]   No, no, not if it's a choice.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.680]   It's a long-star trek.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.480]   And here a character's name referenced
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.120]   and he'll get a T-shirt off top of him.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.200]   Oh man, they just mentioned Tomack and Talad.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:34.760]   I've got it, Talad, I've got to go to Ragnarok
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.120]   and get the special T-shirt.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.280]   It's my dream to do that with Twit.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.760]   It would be really good if the little things
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.800]   could pop up in the corner.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.000]   I wouldn't have to sell so much.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.880]   Go buy a Mustang.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.320]   Click.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.600]   Yeah, save me a lot of time.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:47.920]   Yep.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920]   A lot of trouble.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.000]   Speaking of time and trouble,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:51.920]   we better wrap this thing up.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.800]   There's so many stories.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.840]   Okay, each of you.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840]   Oh, quick.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.280]   Each of you could pick a story
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.840]   that you think we ought to be talking about.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.720]   There was a big Samsung TouchWiz vulnerability,
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.040]   which they have patched.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.640]   It was pretty stupid vulnerability.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.480]   Apparently, there's a code you could enter into the dialer
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.760]   that would erase the phone, everything, a hard reset,
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.880]   all your data, and then there was a further code
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.200]   that would erase all the data on the SIM card.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.600]   It was just open, all you had to do was enter it,
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.520]   and then it turns out that you could do that
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.720]   with an NFC chip, you could do that with a text message,
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.960]   you could do that with a malicious website,
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.000]   and you just go to the site and boom, your device is reset.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.760]   So if you have a Samsung Galaxy S2 or S3
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.200]   and Samsung offers you an over-the-air download today,
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.360]   take it because they have patched it.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360]   And I was just checking,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.520]   'cause I'm running CM10 on my Galaxy S3,
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.120]   and CM10 is not vulnerable.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.160]   Yeah, I think Jelly Bean,
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.000]   or maybe if it's even Ice Cream Sandwich,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.360]   and up was okay, at least Jelly Bean, I'm sure.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   Jelly Bean and up is fine.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.400]   That's why I did CM10, 'cause I wanted Jelly Bean.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.320]   That's why I really love Jelly Bean.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.080]   Here's the stock Android, you're safe.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:58.920]   Yes.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.760]   It's the TouchWiz.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.680]   It's just the TouchWiz.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.480]   It should be spelled differently.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:09.320]   Dick, did you see Dick Costello of Twitter?
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.600]   Talking at ONA?
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.400]   And I jumped up to ask a question.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.160]   He spoke at the Online News Association.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.920]   He's been on a PR role.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.120]   He did Charlie Rose.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.120]   He just did, I think, CMBC.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.320]   He's done some other, so Emily Bell,
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.240]   brilliant journalist from the Ex from the Guardian,
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.080]   now at Columbia, my friendly competitor interviewed him.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.200]   He did an excellent job.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.040]   She started off asking him,
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.200]   "Well, how was it Dick to be in charge
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.560]   "of the free speech of the modern world?"
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.640]   Great question.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.720]   It was.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.560]   He got a lot of stuff about the platform.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.080]   His argument, which I don't fully understand,
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.520]   but he was arguing that what their aim is,
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.680]   is to enable people to accrete value,
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.080]   that Amazon opened up its platform,
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.960]   it enabled other stores to come in,
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.360]   to sell goods at lower prices than Amazon,
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.000]   but they accrete value to the customer
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.080]   and to the partner and to Amazon itself
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.600]   in that process and he wants the same thing.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.760]   But he's, keep talking about developing into Amazon,
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.600]   not on top of Amazon.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.440]   Into Twitter.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.280]   Into Twitter.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.120]   Into Twitter.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.520]   That would have been something.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.440]   Well, a little commerce partner,
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.120]   if you're blogging about shoes.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.560]   So developing into Twitter,
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.920]   and I don't know what that fully means,
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.080]   but I push them, I got up and asked about the,
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.040]   you know, the communications.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:28.880]   And then I said,
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.720]   I don't know if I said,
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.960]   are there any more shoes to drop?
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.280]   And he said, no.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.120]   That was the headline.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.640]   No more shoes to drop.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.920]   So if this, then that, Jeff,
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.840]   it sounds like the term that.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.280]   He argued great question, Matt.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.480]   Somebody asked about that.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:49.040]   Well, he said, he said it had nothing to do with them
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:49.880]   in their platform.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.160]   This is stories that come out.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.680]   We should explain that they were cut off from Twitter access.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.040]   If this and that's a great website that lets you say,
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.600]   hey, if I see a tweet with his hashtag,
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.800]   then email it to me or do some other action.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.280]   They no longer have that access.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.840]   Here's, well, here's the problem that,
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.560]   that, so Dick said on the stage,
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.360]   well, no, that people are saying that's the,
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.360]   the API has nothing to do with the API.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.000]   And then he changed the subject.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.600]   And then afterwards, I was talking to the good folks
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.400]   from Storify.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.160]   And they said, well, no, the reason if this and that went
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.560]   was because they were storing and forwarding tweets.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.640]   And you're not allowed to do that,
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.760]   which also could affect a place like Storify,
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.000]   though, Twitter said they love Storify.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.960]   So there are shoes dangling, I would say Matt still.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.800]   - Okay.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.560]   - Yeah, he also says he's got a,
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.520]   he's got a replacement in mind for the follower count.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.400]   That's kind of a cloud score.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.080]   - No, I think it was,
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.520]   - Oh, Ev said that, that's right.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.920]   - Yeah, Ev, I've wanted,
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.360]   his retweets are more important than followers.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.600]   - I think that's, that's kind of true.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.440]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.600]   - But how many people see the retweet is your follower count?
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.920]   - Well, that's what Ev said.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.000]   The money this was, Ev was being impish.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   I saw Ev too at Medium and some really interesting thinking
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.520]   that he's doing, of course.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.480]   And so I tried to talk a little bit about Twitter
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.320]   and he just kind of shrugs.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.280]   And so he did an appearance in New York this week
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.880]   with BuzzFeed and Branch.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.320]   And I think he was being impish about saying,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.000]   well, I shouldn't say things because I'm on the board,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.080]   but, and, you know, he, he, that mentioned a retweet
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.680]   being probably a more important metric
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.880]   and said that the real goal,
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.120]   and this is, this is, this is, I think, very impish.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.640]   'Cause I've asked about this before.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.320]   The real goal is to get a number of the tweets
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.520]   that are actually seen.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.240]   You know, there's a huge impression, actual impressions.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.680]   - Actual impressions of tweets, right?
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.640]   So I, my follower list got so big
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.720]   and I'm not going to groom it and so it's a mess.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.640]   So I use my MediaWonks list mainly.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.360]   I read that every tweet on that,
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.840]   but I don't read every tweet of everybody that follow.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.880]   Most don't.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.520]   So there's a huge volume of tweets
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.280]   that are never seen by a human eye.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.600]   And for Ev to say that,
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.960]   that's kind of a little weak underbelly of Twitter there,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   I thought, which was interesting, but I think it's very honest.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.840]   That if Twitter is going to argue that they have this value,
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.480]   they're going to have to get honest about that valuation
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.200]   because if they are a media company
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.680]   and note they may hire a Hollywood guy
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.800]   to be on their board, Peter Chernin, X News Corp.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.720]   If they were, and, and costless had, no, no, no,
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.680]   we're a technology company that is in the media business.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.280]   We're not a media company.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.920]   They're a media company.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.280]   And if they're a media company,
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.200]   they're going to have to do things like measure accurately
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.000]   and they're going to get audited for those things.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.160]   So they better get the rack together
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.720]   because that's what media companies have to do too.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.080]   - Real quickly, Marissa Meyer revealed, no, she didn't.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:30.920]   - Not really.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.560]   - She said she was gonna, but she didn't.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.880]   Radical transparency, but she didn't say what she was gonna do
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.640]   to an all hands meeting.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.840]   She called it an act of radical transparency.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.120]   Cara Swisher pointed out, so they didn't say no such thing.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.440]   - Anybody else bullish? - Care?
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.840]   - Huh? - Is anybody else bullish on Yahoo?
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.040]   - Yeah. - I mean, I'm absolutely.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.640]   - I'm bullish on Marissa because she's working so hard.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.360]   And if you look at the stuff she's done already,
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.400]   being able to sell some of the assets in Asia,
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.320]   free food for the employees, letting the employees get
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.440]   phones that aren't Blackberries,
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.600]   like she's taking really good steps to get goodwill,
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.800]   which then she can parlay that into people doing good work.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.120]   So. - Yep.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.880]   - And yet, she has to come up with a strategy.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.720]   It's all well and good to give people food.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:23.040]   - Well, I think we do see the glimmers of it.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.560]   I think that what, and maybe this is just me projecting
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.880]   on what my thoughts are on her,
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.080]   but she understands excellent services, great experiences,
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.840]   and she understands data about people
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.640]   and acting on that data about people.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.360]   And I think that I saw glimmers of that
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.040]   in what leaked out from the session,
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.400]   that she's gonna improve email
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.600]   and she's gonna clean it up and do other things.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.880]   But that I think services that yield data
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.400]   about people that she can act upon,
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.120]   I still think is probably where she has.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:51.960]   - All right.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.080]   Unless you guys have another story that you,
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.400]   you got covered? - One of the most
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.800]   great, real quick is the "Me and Your Troll" story.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.440]   - I thought that was interesting.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.280]   What is that?
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.640]   - A guy was being horribly, horribly, horribly,
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.360]   trolled, he left Twitter,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.120]   he was getting not just things online,
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.200]   but he and his wife were getting horrible things.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.240]   - That's not trolling.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:15.080]   That is stalking. - That is abuse.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.200]   - It's harassment. - Yeah, harassment.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.840]   - He got a friend who was better at technology
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.360]   to try to track down and found out
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.400]   that even the foreign domains tracked back
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.440]   to a friend's house.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.960]   And of course, he's a teenage kid who was doing this.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.320]   And so he met the kid and the kid,
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.600]   one hopes learned a lot of lessons
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.440]   and is gonna get a lot of help.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.680]   And so, but it's an interesting way
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.080]   that we talk so much about trolls and faceless trolls
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.360]   and to get behind the story of one that went overboard,
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.040]   but then ends somewhere where you know
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.240]   where the ending is, I think it's kind of fascinating to people.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.080]   So I recommend that on the other side.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:47.920]   - Yeah, it's good.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.560]   It's at Trainers Eye, this is the guy, Leo Trainer,
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.560]   t-r-a-y-n-o-r-s-e-y-e.com, if you wanna read
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.480]   about meeting his troll and he's back on Twitter,
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.080]   has a happy ending.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:01.920]   - I don't know if any of you guys
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.760]   had any other stories you wanted to hit.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.640]   - Anything one where the artist put the Google Maps
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.840]   people up on the application?
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.160]   - I love that. - That was kind of cute.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.680]   I bookmarked that 'cause I thought that was so neat.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.640]   I think a German or a Dutch, maybe a Belgian,
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.640]   maybe a Flemish, I don't know, artist who noted that,
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.480]   as we noted when we had our street view done here
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.120]   at the Brickhouse Studio that Google requires,
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.080]   people be blurred so you don't see their faces.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.800]   And then he knows that some people were actually glitched.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.080]   Of course, that happens with Street View
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.400]   'cause it's a car driving by.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.480]   So he decided to make life-size cutouts.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.160]   Paolo Cidio, I guess he's Italian,
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.960]   made life-size cutouts of people who are glitched
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.800]   in Street View and put them where they were
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.800]   when they were glitched.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.760]   So this is the Street View picture on the right,
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.240]   on the left, it's actually a cutout
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.960]   with a blurred face and everything,
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.800]   on the actual spot in London where that picture was taken.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.000]   Here's one in Berlin.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.040]   I love it. - Oh, there it is.
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.800]   - This is just so whimsical.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.880]   - Another one in London. - That's bright there, yeah.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.520]   - There's New York.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.480]   So there's, so there on the right is the Street View picture.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.760]   On the left is the actual spot
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.960]   where he made the cutout and put,
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.240]   this is my favorite one.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.360]   Some construction workers sitting on a stool
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.840]   in New York on Houston Street.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.080]   There he is.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.520]   I'm sorry, that's pronounced Locutus Street.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.600]   And there he is, and there he is right there.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.320]   Isn't that great?
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.160]   Am I right?
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.240]   - I love that the glitches and the blurs are in there.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.080]   I think that's hilarious. - Yeah, he clues the whole thing.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.480]   It's really funny.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.240]   It's just, that's art, right there.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.440]   - That's art, that's art!
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.640]   Watch out, Banksy.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.960]   - Yeah, this guy.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.480]   So, Matt cuts ice guy, I got an 18 year old boy.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.320]   Just turned 18 in August.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.520]   I think he should vote, don't you?
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.480]   - I really do.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.120]   And in fact, my tip for this week is,
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.560]   is internetvotes.org.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.440]   You know, I'm wearing my soap shirt partially
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:04.000]   because I feel like if the internet is a great constituency,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.320]   then politicians ought to be paying attention to the internet
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.720]   and all of us on the internet.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.280]   And so internet votes is basically a get out the vote campaign
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.520]   for people on the internet.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.480]   It lets you do banner ads and widgets on your site
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.560]   and you can even get viral stuff going with Facebook.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.520]   So you can sort of ping and remind your friends
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.480]   to vote as well.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.920]   We need to get a lot of people who are net savvy,
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.120]   you know, elected, and this is a really great way to do it.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.480]   So this is a site by some of the people
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.360]   who had helped with the SOPA protest stuff,
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.400]   like the future. - This is great.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.560]   This is great.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.000]   So if you have an 18 year old or an even worse
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.880]   somebody larger who has not registered,
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.760]   he said, "I don't know how."
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.440]   I said, "I think you can figure it, go to the post office."
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.920]   - You go to Google and ask.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.160]   - Or maybe go to Google.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.160]   - In some places like California, you can do online.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.720]   - So if I have this here, he could just enter his email address,
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:58.000]   his zip code, press the register to vote thing,
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.280]   fill it all out here, and it will do it for him.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.200]   I'm gonna, let me just like it on Facebook right now
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.920]   so that, at least I'll have it on my Facebook.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   And then I can say, "Hey, Henry,
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.720]   "if you just follow me on Facebook."
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:15.040]   Do you, that is Matt Cutts' tip of the week, Matt.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.600]   We wanna thank you so much for being here.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.040]   Really appreciate it. - Yeah, but too long, Matt.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.680]   It's great to have you back. - I love having you here.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.160]   And it's so bravely. - Thanks so much.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.440]   - And also, he's tip is to turn on two step.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.840]   Do the two step.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.680]   - Please, don't get your account hijacked.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.080]   I've got two spam emails from friends.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.400]   And if they just turned on two factor authentication,
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.200]   they wouldn't have to deal with the humiliation,
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.640]   the embarrassment, the stress, the loss.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.920]   It's a little bit of hassle, and it'll get easier over time,
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.480]   but it'll keep your account safer.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.720]   - The only thing that bugs me,
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.640]   I use Google Authenticator,
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.040]   and that's what you use for two step.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.120]   You can, or you can have, actually, you know,
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:50.960]   it's really nice.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.160]   I did this too, you could print out authentication codes
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   you could skip in your wallet.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.000]   So if you lose your phone, you're not in luck.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.840]   - Yep.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.280]   - But when I move my authenticator to the iPhone 5,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.720]   'cause I have to test it for a while,
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.640]   I had to start over again with it.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.520]   - Yeah.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:07.720]   So they're working on making it easier to sign up,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.840]   so ideally it would be like 30 seconds instead of like--
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.480]   - It'd be nice if I could just have more than one authenticator,
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.000]   but I guess that's--
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.160]   - You can.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.000]   You can.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.200]   So at one point in the process,
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.360]   there's a QR code that you take a picture of,
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.240]   and that's basically a secret that seeds the algorithm--
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.680]   - Oh, so I could use two phones to take the picture.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.520]   - Yes.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.400]   - Just leave the QR code up and take pictures
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.320]   with as many devices as you want,
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.160]   and then any one of those will be authenticator ready.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.400]   - Perfect, so I'm gonna do it one more time,
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.520]   and I'm just gonna have all my phones ready,
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.680]   and do it on all of my phones.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.680]   - 18 in a row, yeah.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.600]   - I am gonna do that.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.800]   I'm gonna do it on tablets. - On tablets, on everything,
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.000]   'cause it's nice to have authenticator in a variety of spots.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:47.840]   - Yeah.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.520]   - Good tip, that's a good tip, Matt Cuts.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.400]   That QR code works more than once.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.960]   - In other words, if you keep it around,
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.200]   have it lying around.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.640]   And now Aaron Newcomb's tip or tool, I love this one.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   - Yeah, so Jeff kind of talked about it a little bit.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.480]   - Sorry about that.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.560]   - No, no, that's okay, 'cause we,
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.160]   I mean, people give away your numbers regularly, so.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.000]   - Who would do that?
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:10.840]   - Yeah.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.680]   - You don't have to apologize.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.520]   - Oh, who?
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.360]   - You don't have to apologize at all.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.600]   So earlier today, at least this is the first time
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.400]   I saw Google released Google Maps Ocean, or Oceans.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.680]   - This is so cool.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.600]   - Which is very cool, so they actually have been taking
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.600]   pictures underwater in certain key areas, touristy areas.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.440]   - Not bad enough.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.240]   - And they actually built a special camera
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.320]   that goes underwater.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.080]   I mean, it's like a special rendition of the Google camera,
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.240]   the mobile Google camera that goes underwater.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.720]   And they went and took all these amazingly cool
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.960]   underwater pictures, and you can actually now,
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.360]   in Google Maps, explore underwater, literally.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.400]   - So wild.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.080]   - Just like Google Street View.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.880]   And it is absolutely cool.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.440]   I mean, we had OpenROV on Floss Weekly a couple weeks ago,
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.360]   who are building a little thing to go do this,
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.760]   like by yourself.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.000]   But to be able to actually go access this without having
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.200]   any equipment or anything, you know,
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.680]   maybe you're afraid of going underwater,
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.920]   you just always wanted to see what was down there.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.000]   You can now actually go do that in Google Maps Ocean.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.600]   So very, very, very cool.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.280]   - Wow, these are beautiful.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.680]   I mean, it's hard to get underwater images.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.320]   This is clear with so little back spatter and stuff.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.280]   This is great. - Exactly.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.840]   Yeah, the camera equipment that they use must have been
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.240]   really fantastic.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.040]   - Wow, cool.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.120]   - It's like Google Sea View.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.440]   - Yeah, Sea View.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.280]   - Yeah.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.120]   - Yeah.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.680]   - And by the way, and it's not on Apple Maps either.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.720]   (laughing)
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.560]   They don't have that out.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:40.000]   - They don't even have an ocean on Apple Maps.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:40.840]   - Yep.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.280]   - No, I'm just, I'm kidding.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.520]   I'm a kidder.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.160]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.520]   - Well, I think it's interesting that Google stock
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.640]   passed its all time high, which was 74890.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.640]   It closed today at 753.46, it was over 760.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.960]   And the interesting to me is according to
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.480]   International Business Times, that makes Google now
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.320]   that by market capital, fifth largest corporation
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.600]   in the world.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.320]   With an only a 5% gain, it would surpass Microsoft
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.120]   and ExxonMobil to become the third largest.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.080]   Now then there's still, I'm sorry, no, it would surpass,
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.960]   let me get that right, is barely behind Walmart
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.800]   and Microsoft.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.960]   It would then become third behind Apple and ExxonMobil.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.240]   There's still quite a bit of a gap there.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.040]   Market cap of Google is 245 billion, market cap of Apple
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.400]   is 645 billion.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.960]   But you know when this Maps thing plays out,
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:38.800]   you don't know where that is.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.720]   (laughing)
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.480]   - Oh man, hit 'em while they're down.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:48.880]   Boom, and 25 billion downloads, which was the other one.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.720]   Yep.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.480]   Oh, you wanna talk about Nuzzle?
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.240]   All right, we could do Nuzzle as my tool.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.680]   I think you have to be, it's a beta.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.520]   This is Jonathan Abrams, the guy who started Friendster,
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.520]   has a thing called Nuzzle, which is a new news,
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.320]   friend news, there's so many of these.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.040]   Social news, aggregator, kind of a thing of a gob.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.960]   And you have to sign up, beta.nuzzle.com
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.800]   and then get invited, I did get invited.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.720]   So here's what it would look like.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.280]   And actually it's a really good sort,
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.040]   did you put this in here, Jack, 'cause you're on Nuzzle?
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.400]   Who put this in here?
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.240]   Did you put this on?
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.080]   - I did.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.080]   - Mac cuts.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.840]   Mac cuts, knock it in.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.680]   - I'm sorry.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.720]   - No, I needed a tool, I appreciate it, that's good.
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.880]   I was gonna do CM10, but that's good, I like it.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.880]   So this is Nuzzle, and you know,
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.760]   there's so many social news solutions,
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.600]   but I do like, I particularly like this one,
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:47.920]   'cause you see all the tweets.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:53.000]   It is, and you have settings in this too,
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.320]   not just the, how recently,
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.120]   but also how many friends,
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.840]   you could sort of buy the number of friends
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.520]   who liked it or sort of chronologically.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.320]   You could show stories that say,
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.120]   at least 10 friends retweeted this,
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.200]   so that's gonna give you a very strong,
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:15.320]   indicator that this is a story your friends are following.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.160]   We all know that Twitter is a really useful way
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.920]   to find out what's going on.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.360]   In fact, we were asking Steve Gibson last show,
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.440]   how he keeps up with security,
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.640]   says I let people tell me on Twitter.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.200]   When somebody comes to me and says,
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.400]   "Hey, did Andy Williams just die?
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.440]   "Where do you go?
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.280]   "You go to Twitter, right?"
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.120]   - Yeah.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:35.960]   - So first thing you do?
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.760]   - Well, the older people might.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.400]   - What do young people do?
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.480]   - I don't know, Andy Williams.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:41.320]   - Andy Hools?
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320]   (laughing)
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.800]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.200]   - But they ask on Twitter.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.880]   - They say, "Hey, my dad's so sad.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:48.800]   "Why?
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.760]   "Why is Dad sad 'cause of Andy Williams?
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.240]   "Who is that?"
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.080]   - Who is that?
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:53.920]   - Who is he?
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.400]   - Was he in the Beatles?
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.240]   (laughing)
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:59.040]   - Why is it that online?
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:30:59.920]   - I'm rough.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.240]   - No, but is that a journalism bubble that we go
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.040]   and look at Twitter when somebody dies?
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.360]   I think you do that, Chad.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.760]   Where Chad is a young person.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.360]   - Oh, it's funny 'cause my litmus test was Balloon Boy.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.760]   Like when the whole Balloon Boy thing was happening
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.000]   and I was still in college,
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   I went straight to Twitter.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.360]   I didn't have a TV.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.240]   - Even if you did, you won't watch CNN.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.160]   They won't know about Balloon Boy for days.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.600]   - Right, right.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.360]   - And even if they did, the video wouldn't be available
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.560]   for hours and hours.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.080]   - So it's clear Twitter is a good signaling mechanism
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:29.920]   for breaking news.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.520]   And this nuzzle, I think, is an interesting idea.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.360]   And it's, I've also tried Prismatic,
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.360]   which is Petra's husband's business.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.240]   She's a Google engineer.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.800]   She's a Gmail, which is why I'm pointing at Matt Cutz
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800]   as I try to remember.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.160]   Petra Cross, that's it.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.760]   Brad Cross, Bradley Cross is her husband.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.640]   That's another social media play.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.200]   There are quite a few of these social news play.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.560]   - And I just love the idea of,
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.360]   you know, you don't have time to pay attention
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.600]   to Twitter all the time.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.920]   So if you're in an eight hour set of meetings,
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.760]   you can come here and you can just see what you've missed.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.600]   - Yeah, what did I miss?
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.800]   - Yeah, and if you go all the way down to the bottom,
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:08.440]   they actually have something that's like 50 more stories.
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.320]   And that will take out the people you follow,
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.800]   but it will show stories from the people they follow.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.000]   So you can kind of spread your viewpoint out a little bit.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.960]   - That's actually a really good idea.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.000]   - And then you can look at other people's nuzzle feeds.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:22.840]   - Yeah.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.160]   - Nuzzle is a nozzle with a you.
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:26.400]   You're in the nozzle.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.120]   - You just got it.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.960]   Anyway, thank you Aaron Nukem from Oracle
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.440]   and more importantly from the sourceshow.org.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.080]   Follow and obey.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:37.920]   - That's right.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.200]   And you can watch me on Floss Weekly.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.920]   You can also see me occasionally on all about Android.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.000]   So yeah.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.760]   - And he'll be playing with Darnock and Jalad,
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.200]   September at Chuckles.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.880]   - To Nagra's Chuckle Hut.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.720]   - That's right.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.960]   - You can actually, hey listen,
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.080]   if anybody wants to get this shirt,
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.160]   you can actually get it on Spreadshirt.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.600]   It's up there, it's available.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.040]   And there's no commission for me,
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.120]   but I just put it available there.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:01.960]   So people go ahead.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   - This is geeky as you get it.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.000]   - It's selling like hotcakes
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.080]   and I didn't put any commission.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:05.920]   What am I thinking?
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.760]   I should have.
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:07.600]   - Wait, did you design this?
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.280]   - I did not design the actual logo,
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.200]   but I put it on the shirt and then put it,
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.440]   made it available for people to actually get.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.840]   - So what would I search for?
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.480]   - The geek, the geek, the geek, the Darnock.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.360]   - The Darnock and Jalad.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.680]   - Probably is the only Darnock T-shirt
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.440]   on all of Spreadshirt.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.760]   - I have that so much.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.800]   I'm gonna make it.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.640]   - Oh, it should be on there.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.480]   - Darmock.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.320]   - Yeah, Darmock.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.640]   - Oh, Darmock.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.480]   Oh, Darmock.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.480]   - Darmock.
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:32.320]   - Darmock.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.160]   - Now I know what you're doing.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.000]   - There it is.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.160]   - Look, there's a whole bunch of them.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.360]   Oh my God.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.520]   - The first one's mine, I think.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.600]   - Oh my God, this is a meme.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.360]   Yeah, yours is the best.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.960]   Yours is, although Shaka when the walls fell,
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:47.880]   that's not bad either.
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.120]   - That's pretty good.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.240]   - But I would go for the Darnock and Jalad at Tanagra.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.400]   Darmock.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.000]   - Darmock and Jalad at Tanagra,
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.600]   when the walls fell.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.720]   (laughing)
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.800]   That's my Picard.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.480]   - Which episode is that?
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.320]   - Oh, I don't know.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:06.160]   I think it's--
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.880]   - Did you see that both Jean-Luc Picard and Captain Kirk
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.240]   were tweeting about bad time Warner service?
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.080]   - Oh, really?
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.160]   - Yes, it was dueling captains.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.840]   (laughing)
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.120]   Both of them on two different coasts
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.320]   were having trouble with their cable service.
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.640]   - Wow, at the same time.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.480]   - We can talk more to man to the moon.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.320]   - That's discrimination.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.640]   - We can't get the cable service.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:27.560]   (laughing)
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.600]   - Thank you, Matt Cutts.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.440]   Come back soon.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.320]   Thank you, Aaron Newcomb.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.560]   You two, of course we'll see you next week.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.600]   Maybe we'll see the new mommy, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.440]   - I hope so.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.760]   - Yeah, and all of our hosts go to the moms.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.680]   - Our love and support and happiness
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.400]   to Regina and her wife for that.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.240]   - Episode?
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.160]   - Perhaps you didn't know, but it was Star Trek,
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.920]   the next generation in season five, episode two.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.760]   - Wow, really?
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.680]   - Yes, maybe.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.520]   - You did that, Leah?
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.160]   - If you'd been following more closely,
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.360]   you would have remembered that.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.160]   I have it in my captain's log.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.040]   I've been writing down every event
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.760]   that happens right here.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.200]   (laughing)
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.040]   - Oh, man.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.120]   - We in the business call at ST Cohen TNG 5/2.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.720]   - You have a show title for that.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.960]   (laughing)
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:16.800]   - Oh, here is Sir Patrick Stewart's tweet.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.760]   "All I wanted to do was set up a new account
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.160]   with Time Warner Cable, but 36 hours later,
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.240]   I've lost the will to live."
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.080]   - Wow.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.080]   (laughing)
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.760]   It's the dramatic reading that really makes it right there.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.680]   - I interviewed him once, he's really just like that.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.240]   - By the way, he's just like that.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.640]   It's great Shakespearean actor, Sir Patrick Stewart.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.920]   - Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.200]   I hope you enjoyed this week in Google.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.720]   We do the show every Wednesday, 1 p.m.

[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.840]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:06.340]   (ethereal music)
