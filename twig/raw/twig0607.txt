[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff's here.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.340]   Stacy's here, Ant's here.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.600]   Yay, the whole gang's here.

[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.240]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.480]   Google denies the rumors that the Pixel 5A is canceled.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.880]   I guess that's good news.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.720]   We'll win off over the rumored Pixel watch.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.840]   Why Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T just can't get it together
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.680]   while Project Chip can.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.800]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.840]   Good to see you.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   Stacey on IoT.com.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.200]   She's very excited.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.960]   She has something.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.600]   Stickers.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.480]   And lots of things.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.480]   Stickers.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.040]   New stickers.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760]   I'm giving you a chance to show the new stickers.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.400]   That was just-- that was pretty show fun.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.560]   I'm not trying to mark it.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.400]   She's like me.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.480]   She doesn't want to mark it.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.160]   She doesn't want it.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.120]   Those are so cute.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.760]   Dude, they're cute.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.920]   It's the logo from the website, but it's cut out.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.520]   It's die cut.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   So oh, that's great.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.280]   I want some.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.120]   I think they're cute.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.200]   I love that.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.640]   I'll put them on.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.240]   And they're little zeros and ones.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.760]   My friend Biz designed this for me after Gigo
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.800]   own blew up.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.440]   It's the podcast logo.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.760]   She did such a great job.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.560]   It is also the podcast logo.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.920]   The IoT podcast you do with Kevin Tofel.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.120]   Stacey on IoT.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.240]   That is a great logo.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.080]   Yeah, I like it that it's die cut.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.640]   I think that was really smart.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.640]   It was fancy.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   Yeah, fancy.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.840]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.160]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.560]   I hear Jeff Jarvis's voice.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.080]   Hello.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.440]   Hello.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.360]   Jeff Leonard, tap professor for journalistic innovation
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.640]   at the City University of New York.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.320]   Hello.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.040]   Buzz machine doctor.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.560]   Hello.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.320]   Hello.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.280]   And former TV designer.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.440]   It's Gutenberg all day.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.560]   I almost-- you know what?
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.720]   I was going to surprise you and say Google Gutenberg.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   And you will see something.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   Ooh, Google.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.320]   Before we Google Gutenberg, let's say hello to Ant Pruitt
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   from Hop and on photography.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.280]   Hello, Ant.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.760]   How are you?
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.120]   Unbelievable as always.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.680]   See?
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.600]   Always in a good mood.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.520]   I've been seeing a lot of football footage
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.200]   on your Instagram feed of late.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.080]   Ah, yes.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.840]   You have.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.680]   Frowds.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.480]   Proud dad.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.400]   They were proud.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   And the season's winding down this week.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.640]   They're playing it late because they couldn't do it--
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.840]   In the finals.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   --in all of the COVID protocols.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.160]   So they gave them a partial season this spring.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.480]   Now granted, there are other sports that are happening right
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.280]   now as well.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   But they did give them a chance to play five games now.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.400]   That's cool.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.600]   You would enjoy it just because the tennis players
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.400]   are practicing with the football players.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.600]   And it adds to the fun of the game
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.960]   that you have to dodge people's ass.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.160]   That's one way to work on the gym.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.360]   You're a tackle observer.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.160]   What other sports do the hard-heads play?
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.960]   They both enjoy track and field as well as football.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.080]   But my youngest hard-head also enjoys soccer.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.440]   But he's not going to do soccer because it's
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.800]   during track season and track is--
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.000]   What other track field events?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.120]   My oldest hard-head, he's a quarter-miler.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.040]   But I think he could be a good half-miler, too,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   if he wants to try it.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.400]   But I don't know if he wants to try it.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.720]   He's claiming he wants to try to get into the 200.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.280]   Nice.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.360]   He's fast, but that's the hardest race.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.040]   He's on the JV.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.400]   Pardon?
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.440]   He's on the JV.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.200]   No, the seniors on the track.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   Right.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.920]   Seniors varsity.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.280]   He wants to do the 200.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.080]   But I'm trying to tell him, no, dude.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.360]   Just go to the half-mile and the quarter-mile,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.120]   because you'll excel there.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.560]   200 is a hard race.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.240]   Here you go.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.760]   It is.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   Here you go.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.560]   He's going.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   He might be fast.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.200]   He could be.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.800]   He's going all the way.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's the freshman.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   That's the freshman hard-head.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.440]   That's the freshman hard-head.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.160]   Jumper.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.920]   And then is this the senior hard-head?
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.840]   Let's see.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   The freshman's been having-- yeah, that's the freshman.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.520]   He's been tearing it up these last couple of times.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   So he's a quarterback.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.560]   Yes, sir.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.040]   Oh, nice.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.720]   I love the music you put to this.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.240]   Let's watch some more highlights.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.400]   I'm really enjoying this.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.000]   Here we go.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.640]   Here we go.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.280]   Well, see now, this was a lesson learned video.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.680]   Lesson learned video.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.000]   Don't let somebody sneak up behind you.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.800]   Just watch what happens.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   Whoa!
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.600]   He fumbled the ball.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.560]   And--
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.680]   Can't you kill that video?
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.040]   Yeah, really.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   Did you really--
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.540]   Nope.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.040]   Nope.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   No.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.160]   This was a lot.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.040]   I was saying he was a nice guy, but now I'm thinking.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.880]   It's a teachable moment.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.480]   Yeah, but not--
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.560]   This was-- share the teachable moment with--
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.040]   well, of course, you, to be honest, to be fair,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   you show a lot of--
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   No, it isn't teachable moment.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.280]   I mention it even in the post, because that was Cardinal Newman.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   You know how great they are.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.880]   Oh, they are a tough, tough team.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.920]   They're really good.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.120]   And hard hit, fumbled the ball right there.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   They got the ball back and immediately went down
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.000]   the field and scored.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.920]   So essentially, his fumble led to a touchdown.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.360]   Oh, god.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.560]   And he was bent out of shape over it.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.800]   And I had to tell him I pretty much went down
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.880]   to the sideline and yelled at him, say, look,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.040]   don't act like this is the first time you've ever fumbled
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.640]   or the last time you've ever fumbled.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   This is life.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.600]   Suck it up.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.040]   Get back in there and go ball.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.520]   Oh, man.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.640]   Here is our real talk with Ant Pruitt, Jim, because that's--
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.280]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.840]   It's a short show.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.640]   It's pretty brief.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.480]   But-- This is life.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.320]   Suck it up.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   Suck it up.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   Suck it up.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.040]   This is life.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.320]   You're going to screw up.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.480]   But what matters is how do you bounce back from screw it up?
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.760]   Because I've screwed up a gazillion times in my life.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.760]   And still pain.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   No shame to screw up.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.600]   You can't really feel better.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.080]   Because I used to tell my daughter, I'm like, come on.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.640]   Suck it up.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   You're fine.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.160]   You got this.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.400]   And one day she turns to me--
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.840]   because I was upset about something.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.240]   And she's like, just suck it up, Mom.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.880]   And I was like, oh.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.680]   That's harsh.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.680]   Wow.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.680]   And I'm like--
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.960]   So now I'm like, maybe I shouldn't have been saying that
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.560]   to my eight-year-old kid.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   My kids, I never said suck it up in their complete failures.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.280]   So you're doing the right thing.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.280]   And it makes me feel better.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.880]   We had a recent conversation here in the house
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.120]   because I hate losers.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.760]   And I know that sounds harsh.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.240]   But I played ball on a lot of losing teams coming up
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.640]   as a kid.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.280]   And there's a certain loser language
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.480]   that I know it as soon as I hear it from whoever
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.160]   starts to speak it.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.920]   And prior to that Newman game, Hardhead came home
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.840]   and was telling me this and telling me a dad about this player
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.800]   and that player excuses.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.760]   And it was-- no, this is before the game.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.320]   Before the game even started.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.920]   And I said, look, this sounds like loser language.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.600]   And I got pissed off.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.320]   I said, do you haven't even played the game yet?
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.480]   And you're already defeated.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.960]   You can't go through life that way.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.120]   And we all had to have our little come to Jesus moment
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.560]   here in the Pruitt house because I went in on all three of them.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.600]   Went in on Queen Pruitt and the other boy too.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   Because I hate loser talk.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.000]   I hate loser mentality.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.960]   I hate feeling defeated.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.360]   We all got a fighting chance.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.400]   Just some people have different advantages or whatever.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.120]   But please just keep fighting.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.560]   Don't just give in right out the gate.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.440]   Can I share a victory for my son?
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.240]   Please do these.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.560]   His TikTok, for some reason, this video
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.920]   got 415,000 likes.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.040]   Go ahead, Hank.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   He's doing cooking.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.240]   Salt_Hanky changed it from sodium_deficiency.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.280]   He decided he was going to brace the salt.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.160]   But the funny thing is he has COVID while he's doing this,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.040]   right?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   Which is a shame because I can't eat any of this soup.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.640]   And I think the reason he got so many views is because of this.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.360]   Oh, those tomatillos look good.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.280]   Oh, look at Jeff.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.120]   Isn't that look good?
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.480]   Whoa, the dogs.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.520]   Go ahead, Hank.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   Oh.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.360]   He's putting the chicken in.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.120]   Now listen here.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.760]   Listen to him.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.000]   I wish he could smell it.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   He'd tell me what it smells like.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.880]   He doesn't sound that.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.400]   I think I'm having that.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.840]   He can't smell anything, poor kid.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.360]   Oh, no.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   He did sound like he went down.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.560]   Why would you put that much effort into making something
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.200]   that you can't--
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.960]   So Jennifer is smiling.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.800]   Oh, my heart.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.120]   He says, for a refrigerator, it's full of food
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.240]   that I can't eat because he's sick.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.280]   Anyway, 43,000 likes, but almost half a million views.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.280]   I don't know how you get to that many views on that.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.200]   Go ahead, Hank.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.960]   Guess what's up.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   Go ahead, Hank.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.640]   How's he feeling?
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.160]   How's he doing?
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.440]   He's sucking it up.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.200]   No, he's feeling much better.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.280]   He's feeling--
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.840]   He was--
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.320]   Don't tell him that when they're sick.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:56.800]   No, no.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.760]   Suck it up.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.520]   Get out of there.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.640]   Go out and play football.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.240]   I have.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.000]   Swin, they're whining you tell them.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   No, no.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   He had one bad day where he said I felt like it
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320]   had 12 rounds in the ring.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.440]   Next day, he's up and around.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.720]   Day after that, he still can't smell anything.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.440]   That's why I was saying that in the video.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.200]   Now he can.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.720]   He's fine.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   He's feeling much better.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.800]   It was five days.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.520]   And he was--
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.160]   How's the smell?
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.800]   Smell back?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.000]   Smells back.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.680]   Oh, good.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.920]   Oh, shh.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.680]   So he's young.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.360]   He's 26.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.920]   He got the minor version.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.160]   I got the second shot today.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.760]   So at any point, I could just pass that right now.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.640]   And you better not say suck it up.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Anyway, getting back to the very important birthday today,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.880]   Jeff, happy birthday.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.480]   If you go to--
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.800]   It's not really a birthday, but it appears.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.280]   Oh.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.800]   It's an--
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.920]   And it's not recognizable.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.640]   So what-- so if you go to Google--
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.560]   I don't know why they chose now.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.960]   Because no one knows exactly the year or the time.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.600]   So it's just celebrating--
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.200]   Show my screen.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.400]   In fact, 1,400.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.560]   He was born sometime, given of minus.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.520]   They don't even know the year.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.720]   Years for 1,400.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.560]   They didn't know the year.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.720]   They chose 1,400 because it would
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.160]   be convenient for celebrations.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.480]   OK.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.960]   And he died on February 3rd, 1,468.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.400]   We know that.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.240]   Yes.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.400]   But we don't know what he was born.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.240]   He was down and printed it.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.040]   He should have printed it.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.920]   His name was-- he never put his own name in print.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.600]   That's not his real name?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   No, he-- well, he was born Johann von Gensflyche,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.760]   which means goose flesh.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.920]   Goose meat.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.600]   I got the Gensflyche.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.200]   Just hearing that.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.560]   Gensflyche.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.920]   Zuladm Zugutenburg.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.760]   Yeah, but in that time, you often
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.640]   took the name of the building you lived in.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.120]   And he lived in the Gutenberg.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.640]   Gutenberg means good mountain.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.520]   Good.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.000]   Good.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.960]   Barret Mountain.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.200]   Your last names are a relatively recent invention, aren't they?
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.400]   It really says, yeah.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.240]   Didn't know that.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.000]   That's why Stacey--
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.880]   You sold by many first--
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.400]   --Bofflem.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.640]   --Johann and--
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.960]   --She lived in Higginbotham or something.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.400]   I don't know.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:00.800]   Yes.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.440]   Happy birthday, Stacey.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.280]   Birthday is birthday was Monday.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.760]   That's a real birthday.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.160]   Did you have fun?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.080]   Did you do something fun?
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.040]   I had a migraine.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.720]   But that's OK.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.840]   That's not fair.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   That's not right.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.320]   Did you eat something good?
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:17.680]   I did.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   I had-- so my daughter, actually, today,
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.200]   made me my birthday cookies.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Yay.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.680]   Yay.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.720]   And then I got sushi.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.520]   Yay.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.320]   Both excellent.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.240]   I was excited.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.200]   I have gas station sushi every Wednesday.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.360]   Where do you actually get the sushi?
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.400]   No, it's from the--
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.480]   I love just calling it gas stations.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   I know.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.280]   I don't have that.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:38.960]   Because you can.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.240]   There are gas stations in town where you could buy sushi.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.320]   I wouldn't.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.040]   Please don't.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.000]   There's a nice Japanese restaurant across the street.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.480]   OK.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.040]   Anyway, happy birthday, Stacey.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   It's wonderful.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.360]   I'm not going to ask you which birthday it is.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.480]   I'm 43.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.240]   I am not shy about sharing.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.920]   You don't look at day over 42.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.960]   You're not looking.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.920]   No, you actually--
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.560]   Thank you.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.240]   If you'd asked me, I would have said 32.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.080]   Easy.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.600]   Easy, right?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.240]   But no, that's great.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.800]   Congratulations.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.000]   43 is a wonderful age.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.200]   Oh, is it Scooter X seems to be indicating
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.240]   that it may be his birthday as well?
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.200]   What?
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.760]   Oh, go ahead and--
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.200]   So many of us have birthday as well as April.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.680]   Is it your birthday, Scooter X?
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.120]   Was it your birthday and Monday?
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.640]   Happy birthday.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.280]   Scooter X is our chat moderator.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.920]   One of our chat monitors is a wonderful guy.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920]   A lot of chat scooter X?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.600]   Yeah, really a lot of scooter.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.560]   OK, the chit chat portion of the program is over.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   Everybody tune out.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.960]   We're going to talk about Google X.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.440]   I like that I call me crazy, but that's
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.000]   the part of the show I enjoy the most.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.400]   Of course, it's chit chatting about me.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.360]   So what a surprise.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.240]   Well, shall we talk about phones?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.600]   Let's.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.360]   Or--
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.560]   No, I see the--
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.280]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.840]   We did the puzzle last week for Google I/O.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.640]   We don't know when they're going to announce the Pixel 5A5G,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.120]   but that might make sense to do it.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.840]   Then there was a rumor last week that it had been
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.760]   killed that it wasn't going to do it.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.360]   But Google--
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.000]   It makes sense.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Coming from Google.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.400]   Google, in response, sent the following official statement,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.720]   the Pixel 5A5G, which would normally
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.520]   come out around this time, will be available later this year
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.600]   in the US and Japan only.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.560]   And announced in line with when last year's A-series phone
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.240]   was introduced, in line with when last--
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.920]   who wrote that?
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.480]   Not Stacoms.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.320]   That's--
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.120]   Hey, watch it, my friend Stacoms.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.520]   No, no, I'm saying good things about Stacoms.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.160]   He would never have written a sentence like that.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.680]   Well, hey, Jeff, you're a professor.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.280]   It will be available later this year in the US and Japan,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.600]   and announced in line with when last year's A-series phone
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.240]   was introduced.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.480]   That's pretty awful.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.680]   I mean, I understand what he's trying to say, but--
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.280]   It's awkward.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   Someone was trying to do a word count.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.160]   Oh, it could have been.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   Yeah, they were hoisted by the word count.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.640]   So they announced the last one in August 2020,
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.760]   so it would be round August, I guess.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.560]   Could be earlier.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.400]   Could be later.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:14.840]   But there you go.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.120]   I could be up for a new phone by then.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.160]   Well, we love the 4A.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.480]   Right?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.640]   The 4A.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.440]   No, I had a 3.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.560]   4A is quite nice.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.800]   4A is wonderful.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.360]   The thing is, good luck getting a phone that's not 5G.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.240]   No, of course you don't need a 5G phone,
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.400]   but good luck getting one that's not.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.760]   OK, well, I mean--
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.720]   It just comes with the tear.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.280]   I guess I feel like I want to wait a year,
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.120]   because I always-- you know, when they add the radios,
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.360]   the battery life is going to be kind of sucky.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.200]   The first 5G phones were more than a year ago,
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.160]   so you're in good shape.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   We understand it.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   It's time, Stacey.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.200]   Although remember, remember Verizon's suggestion
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.680]   that for better battery life, disable 5G.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:01.120]   You might be right.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.360]   Maybe I'll wait a little longer.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.960]   Now, I wonder when they're going to do the--
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.200]   there's another product that we're
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.840]   starting to hear rumors about.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.240]   In fact, they feel in writing for Forbes,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.640]   where he writes about consumer text,
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.240]   as the Google Pixel watch leaks with dazzling looks
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.280]   to challenge the Apple watch.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   True that.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.960]   True that.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.520]   Are they-- were you dazzled?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.920]   I was dazzled.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   I was dazzled.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.400]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.240]   That is nice.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.400]   I'm still like, what is it going to be an Android Wear device?
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.600]   I guess so.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.120]   It has to be, right?
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.600]   Unless--
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.440]   Well, that's a Fitbit.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.040]   It's right.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.240]   They just-- the Fitbit acquisition has gone through.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.960]   What if it's a Fitbit?
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.280]   I would-- I mean, I've worn a Fitbit since 2011,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.240]   and I've tried almost everywhereable out there,
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.160]   and I always come back to Fitbit.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.520]   This is the render.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's not a picture, a render from John Prosser,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.520]   the fairly accurate rumor guy.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.440]   So for people listening, what is it
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.040]   that you like about this?
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.920]   It's not a stupid square watch.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.520]   It's round like a watch should be.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.920]   I like it because it's flat.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.120]   It has a nice square all round.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.960]   Android Wear watches have almost always been round,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.680]   compared to the stupid pill shape of the iPhone.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   Yeah, see, even Leo thinks it's stupid.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.360]   No, it's crazy.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.840]   It looks like a big fat metal pillow on your-- on your wrist.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.720]   But functionality-wise, the Apple Watch is spectacular.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.680]   And that's the problem.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.040]   And that's why Android Wear has been laggardly.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   They just can't compete.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.760]   It's been Fitbit out, and then Apple Watch,
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.880]   and then the slowly Fitbit went down, and Apple Watch went up.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.640]   And I think Apple Watch is easily the dominant-- not only
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.560]   smartwatch, but wristwatch in the world.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   Not saying much.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.320]   It's like saying--
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.400]   We're the best in C.A.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:46.920]   If price--
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.320]   I didn't see a price and guess on this.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.300]   And I hope it would be something affordable the way One
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.480]   Plus is was, but have a much better review after it,
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.600]   because Mr. Howe had the One Plus,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.520]   and he talked about it on all about Android.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.360]   And his hot review comes out this week as well.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.320]   Yeah, not-- he didn't like it.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.760]   Not so good.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   How much was the One Plus again?
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.000]   150 bucks.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.840]   I was already--
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   That's the right price.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.960]   I want that.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.000]   It looked great.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.440]   Jason, what didn't you like about-- he's in our chat room.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.400]   What didn't you like about the One Plus?
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.880]   Well, you tell me, Aunt, because you watched the--
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.040]   Well, the first thing that immediately pops up in my head
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.760]   is it's not an always on display.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.680]   It's a watch.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.080]   Why do I have to tap it to--
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.320]   That's a big problem.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.480]   To see what time it is.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.520]   And then there wasn't an app store forward,
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.240]   so you're very limited on some of the app functionality
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   versus what the other smartwatches have.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.920]   In performance wise, it had its moments of being quick
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.880]   and moments of not so quick.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.240]   Right.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.640]   It's a--
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   Jason's capsule review in five words.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.040]   Excellent design software is half baked.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.760]   There you go.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.440]   This is pretty.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.040]   And if we're--
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.320]   The software can be fixed.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:04.800]   Sure.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.240]   It can be easily, right, with a download.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.840]   I think this is pretty--
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.440]   Oh, see, thanks.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.000]   Because it looks thin.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.040]   It's round, but we don't know how big.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.160]   It might be pretty big.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.160]   I wish it were along the lines of that 46 millimeter,
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.880]   like the one plus would be.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.400]   I big round watch.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.760]   Yeah, big round watch.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.360]   I would like it to come in two sizes then.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   Because 40--
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:25.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.640]   I was like, this is a dinner plate.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.120]   You don't wear a saucer on your wrist.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.920]   It's like Biggie Bit.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.120]   What is it, Biggie Small?
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.080]   Where's the big watch around his neck?
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.920]   Oh, that was flavor flavored.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.280]   Flavor flavored, of course.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.720]   You do it right away.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.240]   Of course.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   It's legit.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.480]   I'm wondering about the brand.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.040]   This doesn't look like it's detachable.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.920]   I would hope it would be.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.040]   That's one of the things Apple Watch does really, really,
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.640]   really well.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.160]   Oh, you're right.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.120]   It doesn't.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.920]   But this is a render.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.840]   Well, but this a render--
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.880]   I mean, sorry.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.840]   Yeah, who knows?
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.440]   It could be ugly and clunky.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.080]   And we don't know.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.320]   Well, I don't know if I think I'm off the watch thing.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.360]   I don't know that I'm going to be--
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.160]   Hey, for important.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.360]   Well, all you young people--
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.600]   I love a good watch.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.920]   Oh, I'm with Miss Stacy.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.320]   I'd like a good functional watch.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.160]   I like being able to--
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.640]   So you can see--
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.080]   I like looking at my screen.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.960]   So I don't want it actually to be always on in here's way.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.480]   Because if it's always on at night when I'm wearing it,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.280]   because I wear mine for sleep tracking, it always--
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:26.880]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.960]   Yeah, that's terrible.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.120]   So I used to have to wear-- I actually used to own--
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.400]   I still own them.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.440]   What are those called sweat bands?
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   And I would wear a sweat band over my watch to keep it dark.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.640]   So I go to bed at night like Richard Simmons.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.880]   Sweat bands and love ones.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.560]   But I actually think it's really neat
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.440]   if you look at what Apple's doing with Apple Fitness.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:21:00.320]   Having-- tying your wearable to your workouts
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.240]   in a really complete way, if you look at what's that--
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.320]   there's a program you pay $150 for a coach that's
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.080]   delivered via an app.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.320]   And they monitor you from your Apple Watch.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.920]   What is it called?
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.400]   Aunt Shirley, you know what this is called.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.600]   But that's an invasion of privacy.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.040]   No, no, no.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.720]   You sign up for it and give them--
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.520]   and the reason you do it is they'll--
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.960]   if it's like 4 o'clock and they're like,
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.160]   Stacy, you have sitting on your butt all day.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.640]   I'll be like, oh, no, my coach knows
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   I'm sitting on my butt all day.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.600]   I got to go work out.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   That's good.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.680]   I've heard about that.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.160]   I don't know the service, though.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.920]   I have a picture of Stacy from--
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.760]   this is what she looks like when she goes to bed,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.120]   just so everybody's prepared.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.720]   That's a flavor flavor, this big old clock
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.320]   hanging around his neck.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.520]   Why do we always need to know what time it is, really?
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.600]   Because some of us are always busy doing something.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.840]   Oh, you got places to be?
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.000]   I was going to say--
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.680]   I can't say I have places to be, but I usually have things
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.760]   to do.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.640]   Here's the picture I should have used.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.480]   Stacy, she with attitude.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.000]   Ready for bed.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.040]   Wow.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.560]   That's a trademark giant clock around your neck.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.840]   He's a legend.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.800]   He's a legend.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.920]   All right, well, we'll watch.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.320]   I'm thrilled, first of all, Google's doing IO this year,
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.960]   because it really felt like last year was almost
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.360]   a lost year for Google.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.920]   And maybe they'll announce the watch.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.480]   I'm hoping they'll announce, for your sake, Jeff,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.920]   a Pixelbook.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.040]   I hope so.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.280]   At least you could do for me for after I
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.080]   you abused me all these years for being your workspace,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.840]   paying customer you abused.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.240]   At least you could do for me as making Pixelbook.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.360]   Mr. Jeff, they're selling Chromebooks, not Pixelbook.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.480]   So why are they going to continue to push Pixelbook?
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.520]   Well, it's a Chromebook.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.480]   It's just a Chromebook.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.480]   But it's their special.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.400]   It's their special.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.000]   It's their special.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.680]   Their special Pixelbook.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.840]   Maybe you should watch the Samsung Unpacked event, which
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.120]   is two weeks off, April 28.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.760]   They didn't say what it is, but judging by that picture
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.720]   and the title of the most powerful galaxy is coming,
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.080]   it's not going to be a phone.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.360]   It's going to be a laptop.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.880]   And Samsung makes very nice Chromebooks.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.480]   So--
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.960]   Well, they have the--
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.360]   they just have a new one out, which
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.200]   fixed the problems of the last one.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.840]   The new Red one has more battery power, but fewer features.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.800]   That's only if you want sold.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.000]   So maybe not.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.480]   Maybe just--
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   And they do have beautiful apps to have.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.560]   Maybe it's a Windows machine.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.760]   Yeah, maybe it's just a Windows machine.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.040]   How old-- Jeff, do you currently have a Pixelbook?
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.720]   And how old is it?
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.880]   How old are ours, Leo?
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.240]   Feels like it's four years old now.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.160]   It still runs fairly well, although mine hasn't
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.640]   seen a whole lot of action.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.800]   My battery is dying.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.400]   Is it?
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.880]   I still run into the--
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.680]   It'll be fine.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.280]   And then suddenly it goes from 70% to zero.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.720]   These were expensive.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.360]   If you could have spent easily over $1,500 on these Pixelbooks.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:22.840]   Let's see.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.720]   Wonder if I get it.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   I got the Pixelbook October 7, 2017.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.440]   So four years old.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   With my pen and the 128 gig Pixelbook and the personal care,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.160]   total order was $1,439.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.800]   As Google said, what the end of life
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.480]   is going to be, because that's one of the things I don't
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.320]   like about Chromebooks.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.240]   That's on the phone.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.360]   June 2024 for the Pixelbook.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.280]   They say this one ain't making it fair.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.160]   Yeah, you may not.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.600]   That's three years hence.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   So it's struggling toward the finish line.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.440]   The slate goes to 2026 and the go goes to 2026.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.280]   So I don't like that.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   I have to say, it kind of peeves me a little bit
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.000]   when you have hardware that's perfectly good.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.600]   But the company says, ah, we don't want to keep it up to date,
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.720]   so we're going to end the life.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.440]   Which I agree with.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.800]   And I think you've got to have a long enough life to it.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   10 years.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.200]   But security.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.680]   10 years.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   Right?
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.120]   Yeah, but these are just kind of--
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.440]   --supporting the software updates.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.000]   I understand.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.080]   But especially for the price we pay for the Pixelbook,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.440]   they're--
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.280]   10 years is a lot for--
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.800]   Microsoft goes 10 years.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.600]   So I think what's going to be interesting
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.800]   is we're getting to this place--
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.160]   now that we're at kind of the end of Moore's law, right?
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.080]   We're getting to this place where our hardware is actually
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.000]   good enough to last for maybe not 10 years
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.560]   if you look at battery performance.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   And if you think about--
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.560]   But you can replace it off in flash.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.080]   Your memory is going to degrade.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.880]   But I mean, five years is starting
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.080]   to feel like a minimum for a phone or a tablet.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.680]   I agree.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.360]   And then seven years feels like good medium.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:10.840]   Good.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.680]   OK.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   I'll accept the compromise.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.880]   10 feels a little long still.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.240]   Yeah, no, 7 is good.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.680]   I just-- you know what happens to these,
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.640]   they end up in the landfill.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.280]   I just don't feel like that's a--
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.440]   And everything's working.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.640]   France has-- they've got-- they actually
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.080]   have working towards-- or no, it's--
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.920]   the EU is looking at adopting some regulations
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.600]   around end of life and devices that France has pioneered.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.640]   But I cannot talk about it because I don't recall how it works.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.760]   But it's actually a really exciting legislation that
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.840]   would help and includes right to repair stuff.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.920]   Scooter X, birthday boy, is mentioning
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:54.040]   that maybe this is for you, Jeff, that HP has updated its Chromebook
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.720]   X360 with--
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.600]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.400]   --11th, 11th generation Intel processors.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.280]   Oh, look at this.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.720]   Judge in the chat room points out that electrical goods sold
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.120]   in Europe need to be repairable for at least 10 years.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.640]   There you go.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   It's on January 20, 20.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   Thank you.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.320]   So they agree with my 10 years.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.280]   I wonder what the definition of repairable is.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.920]   Yeah, that doesn't necessarily mean the software
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   can be--
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.420]   Right.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.000]   It still works, but it's vulnerable to 100 attacks.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.520]   But--
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.840]   Mostly what they're saying is we will continue to sell battery
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.280]   fixes or, yes, parts if you have to fix it.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:30.840]   I think that's--
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.640]   I can't imagine what we're--
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.200]   I'm in a lot to get my battery fixed.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.240]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.440]   Yeah, these-- because all of the new stuff they glue it in,
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.920]   it's so it can be thin and light.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.640]   I'm still running into Shiba Chromebook 2.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.360]   And a couple years ago, I replaced the LCD on it.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.680]   We just found one on eBay.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.240]   Somebody sold it, swapped it out.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.800]   And it runs just fine.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.080]   I don't really need much support from Google.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.760]   It's just a browser for me to ask this.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.120]   But you do want the security updates.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   You want it to be patched, right?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.880]   You don't care if Google adds flock to it,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.160]   but you do want it to be patched.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.800]   And that's the--
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.760]   I think that's what puts these things out of business
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.960]   is should you use an operating system or browsers that
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.920]   are not being patched for security flaws?
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.360]   And my god, Microsoft yesterday released, I think,
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.600]   was 118 patches of which more than two dozen
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.520]   were critical patches.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.760]   The NSA found four more flaws in Microsoft's Exchange server.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:41.000]   The FBI has admitted that it's been going around software
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.400]   over the network looking at people's Exchange servers
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.760]   and killing any installed web shells
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.240]   installed by the bad guys.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.760]   Just going in, they got a court order.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.360]   They can go in and do that.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.440]   And that gives you an idea of what a nightmare this is.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.400]   So security is very important.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.920]   I don't know if you happen to read the Ben Evans thing I put up.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.080]   You know, I'm a fan of Ben's.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:02.680]   I put these up.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.480]   You probably ignore them.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.080]   But there was a very good column.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.880]   I just don't read it until I get to it.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.000]   So is content moderation a dead end that one?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.520]   Right.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.240]   Well, the reason I'm reading it up right now is
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.720]   he draws a parallel between the openness of Microsoft
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.280]   in the early days and the necessity.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.000]   And what it took to go away from an open operating system that
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.880]   could be hacked and had tons of vulnerabilities
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.280]   toward trustworthy computing, which really meant closing off
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.400]   the APIs, the reviews.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:34.920]   Right.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.800]   Checking for about as the biggest pointed,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.200]   I had to create a whole infrastructure of scanning
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.240]   and monitoring.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.720]   Yes.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.800]   Microsoft made it harder to do bad stuff and wrote software
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.680]   to look for that bad stuff, which sounds very familiar,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.440]   he's saying with content moderation.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   I should point out that that's true, although it's
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.680]   like plugging holes in a dike or a piece of Swiss cheese.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.960]   It's a never-ending process that Microsoft has been singularly
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.080]   bad at.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:05.520]   Right.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.440]   And that's what he's saying is learning the lesson from that.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.320]   Oh, you can't do it.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.920]   It's really saying.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.040]   It's even worse when you're dealing with human beings, right?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   Because we'll find a real way around.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.720]   So that's where he says maybe it's an architectural issue,
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.040]   which I found really interesting, that the fact
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.960]   that you can't put links up in Instagram.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.240]   Just block links just don't allow links.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.680]   When you do that, as for example--
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.160]   Well, you can't put links in Instagram.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.040]   You cannot put a clickable link in Instagram.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.640]   Right.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.320]   So what does that do?
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   I don't know.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.400]   It's not as bad as Facebook because of that, I guess.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.760]   You're right.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.440]   And control it by limiting sharing and retweeting
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.680]   and a lot of the things that they amplify.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.640]   What does that look like that you get to a point where
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.160]   Clubhouse doesn't ever apply as quotes or screenshots.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   Email newsletters don't seem to have variety.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.680]   That may be what's going on, huh?
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.360]   Some people argue the problem is ads or algorithmic feeds,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.440]   both of which he disagrees with pretty strongly.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.760]   But it's the same underlying point.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.880]   Instead of looking for bad stuff, perhaps we should change
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.960]   the paths that bad stuff can abuse.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.440]   I agree.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.080]   And actually, I would add to that things
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.440]   like the YouTube recommendation engine, which slowly
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.800]   radicalizes people over a period of time.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.640]   They could fix that.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.560]   Yeah, there's that too.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.960]   They don't either recommendation.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.440]   By the way--
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.240]   And I do love Benedict Evans' before picture of Twitter.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.400]   This is Hogarth.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.920]   This is Hogarth.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.760]   It's the greatest--
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   Oh.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.040]   And he says, in the piece, Hogarth contrasted dystopian
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.320]   gin lane with utopian beer street.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.440]   Alcohol is good.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.000]   So long as it's the right kind.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.560]   So these--
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.840]   Of course, he says--
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.680]   This is 19th century gin drinkers--
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.560]   or actually 18th century gin drinkers in London.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.800]   And it's not good.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.880]   No, it's not good.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.080]   It's not good.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.720]   If you've never seen this etching, it's a classic.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.560]   There's a biography of Hogarth coming out
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.240]   that I have to order directly from the UK.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.280]   I love his stuff.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.240]   It's just amazing the life that he had.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.840]   There's a favorite one of mine about a musician
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.000]   with the noise of London driving him crazy.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.200]   It's full of life.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.680]   And by the way, Kudos to Benedict Evans for finding that.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.040]   That's a perfect illustration.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.800]   If you want to see it, Google Gin Lane Hogarth, H-O-G-A-R-T-A.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.320]   So just one more sentence if I may.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.920]   He says, of course, if the underlying problem
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.840]   is human nature, then you can still only channel it.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   No one robs payroll trucks anymore.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.320]   But I get lots of messages asking me
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.280]   to send my life savings to Nigeria.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.880]   And so I don't know what--
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.280]   No one robs the same.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   Favorite role trucks anymore, but OK.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.560]   I'll go for argument sake.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.280]   I'll accept that.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   I don't know how much--
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.120]   When was the last time a payroll truck he saw a big heist?
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.560]   I don't know.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.320]   Isn't that a big thing in Boston?
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.760]   There's a whole--
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.280]   I think that's even watching the movies.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.560]   Yeah, maybe that's just in the movies.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:53.960]   I don't know.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.720]   I've watched good films.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.760]   It's been a while.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.040]   There are armored cars.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.240]   He calls them payroll trucks.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.840]   I have for reasons I don't know.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.080]   He's British.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   So anyway, anyway, I think it was interesting
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.560]   that Microsoft has been fighting this forever.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.320]   And there's lessons there for humanity as well.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.640]   That's all.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.280]   Thank you, Ben.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.680]   I've been watching the city on a hill,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.360]   but it's about 1990s Boston.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.320]   So maybe you're right.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:21.840]   There you go.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.680]   People stop robbing trucks around then.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.640]   They just break your Bitcoin.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.480]   That's a big thing to rob, Leo.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.400]   What's the truck for?
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   Oh, man.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.600]   BTC all time high.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:44.320]   $62,599.90 per Bitcoin.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.400]   New record, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.400]   Keep going, Bitcoin.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   Keep on going.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.200]   Do you have any?
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.680]   No.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.760]   No.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.680]   Oh.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.280]   I wish.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.200]   Oh.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.640]   It's actually--
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.240]   I have 3.0322.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.240]   Bitcoin's worth $2,000.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   You're a millionaire.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   Oh, nice.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   Stacey, your beauty is Stacey.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   Do you have any Bitcoin or do you just have cookies?
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   I'm Stacey.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:16.760]   Oh.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.240]   There you are.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.240]   You're back.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   Oh.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.240]   OK.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   That explains why you all were not listening to me when I was trying to talk.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   Oh, sorry.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   Sorry.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   Wave your arms and jam or feel, see you.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   I was like, oh, man.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   They are so rude.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   And then I'm like, maybe I'm muted.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   Anyway.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   We muted you.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   We muted you because you were typing really loud.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   I know.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   Are you on deadline?
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   No, I was trying to find something.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   That's fine.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   Can I get your quiet keyboard?
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   OK.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   I'll stop.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   No, I can get your quiet keyboard.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.240]   No, normally when you're in the face bar.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   Oh, wait.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   It turns you off, but it doesn't right now.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   And I don't know why.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   See, I have this is I have I type all the time on this show, but I have a mushy keyboard.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   You can't tell.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   I think even with the mushy keyboard, you could probably tell.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   I think with her.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   I like this.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   Oh, that's right.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   You're a very passionate.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   I forgot.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   Instead of going squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   OK.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.240]   Well, I was going to tell you I'm writing about it in my newsletter, but on the Bitcoin story.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   I have made like a crazy amount, like just random amount of money.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   On my helium router, which is just offers to be women.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   Your router is mining.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.240]   So I don't remember like a year ago.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   It's their own token, but I like it.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   Like I showed off this this hotspot.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   It was a Laura Wann hotspot that he really made.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   And I was like, y'all, I'm so excited about Laura.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   I'm sharing my Wi-Fi with the Laura man network and blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   You know, Laura is the low range network that Amazon sidewalk uses as well.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   Well, Sidewalk has a proprietary version of it.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   But yes, it is a low power.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   Oh, there's a real wide area.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   There's like an official open low ran as well.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   Yes.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   OK.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   And lots of things run on it.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   Believe it or not, most of them are business, not consumer stuff.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   But anyway, I checked like a month ago and all of a sudden, because people kept asking me
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   what I was doing with my router.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   And I was like, I don't know.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   I'm providing, you know, Laura Wann to anybody in these general vicinity.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   Which is no one since you live on an island.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   It's not true.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   Oh.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   I can see that like people are actually, I can see when someone sends packets using my router.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   Wow.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   Oh, that's kind of interesting.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.240]   Isn't it fun?
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   It's secure.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   I take it.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   I mean, they're not on your network.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240]   They're just.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   Yeah, they're not.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   They're just using my network as back.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   Are there hikers or.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   Can I be shipping?
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   Shipping, really?
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   Well, we're going to wave at Stacey, by the way, next July when we sail by on the cruise,
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   we're going to wave at you.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   I'm going to get everybody on the railing and say, use your Lauren while you're going,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   while you're sailing.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.240]   That's so strange.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240]   So you're close enough.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   You think, what is the range of the lowran?
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.240]   Laura Wann goes out up to three kilometers.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   Oh, so it could be shipping.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:26.440]   So I mean, yeah, maybe it's on the sound and ships do use Laura networks to track containers
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   and things.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   That's not a weird thing.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   A lot of ports have it.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.240]   That's why I'm guessing ships from your house.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.240]   Wow.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   She has a very nice place.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   I can see the sound of your view.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   I know.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   I think she has a nice place.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.240]   That's.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   But so the point is.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:52.440]   I checked and like helium network tokens went from being completely worth nothing to being
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.280]   worth like $15 a token.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.240]   And I have like a thousand of them.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   Wow.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   Wow.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.240]   Because I just.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.640]   So that was a big gap.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.320]   Where do you exchange them?
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.440]   I went to finance and I like.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.840]   Financial buy in a chunk.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   That's nice.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.240]   So are the boats giving you that money?
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   Okay.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   How is this happening?
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.840]   You get your mining crypto.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.000]   Yeah, it's mining crypto.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.240]   And the idea is that's the incentive for people to actually put these hotspots.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   Right.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.920]   So build up a network.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:32.420]   So you get money for like witnessing a new network challenges on the network to make
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.420]   sure you're still.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.560]   Oh, there's not proof of work mining.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.840]   It's it's a proof of coverage.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.800]   Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.560]   That's actually really interesting.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.680]   So I just yeah, so I was really excited because I like basically found, you know, a few thousand
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.000]   dollars on the sidewalk that I had, you know, isn't that much?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   That's awesome.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.040]   Holy cow.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.320]   I pulled in like I pulled out like $10,000.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   What?
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.440]   I'm going to buy one of these.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   Yep.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   You can't.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.760]   Because because if you heard about the chip problem, Stacy could tell you about that
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   too.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.940]   Yeah, the chip problems, the problem and apparently demand to skyrocketed because people
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.940]   are crazy.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.480]   But yeah, so Kevin is like he bought his in January.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.200]   So he's excited, but I just thought it was kind of crazy.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.000]   And I've been jokingly calling this my retirement network for.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.280]   Because it might be the last year, but I'm like, Oh, so at some point we will be able
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.540]   to buy these again, right?
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.540]   Or is it over?
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.540]   Is like, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.920]   Well, you'll be able to buy them and add coverage.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   I don't know if you'll make.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.900]   But there's a story about a 60 week delay in routers now because of the chip short.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.900]   Yeah, that's for ISPs.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.940]   But yeah, yeah.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.140]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.340]   I mean, this is not a go invest in helium as like a get rich.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.260]   To me, it's just like, Oh, I found money in my couch and it just happened to be a lot
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.780]   because cryptocurrencies are weird.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.540]   What you're actually doing is great, which is you're you're you're providing a low-ran
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.620]   network for people in your, I mean, I would see I'm not crazy about Amazon.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.200]   I walk mostly because it's from Amazon, but the concept I love.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.440]   So let's do it open.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.040]   You know, network like that.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.200]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.200]   I love that.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.800]   So what's the, is it helium, the brand of the router?
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.560]   Helium is the network operator.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:28.160]   They use, they used to sell their own routers, but now they have deals with other companies.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.880]   So other things are wrong.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:36.560]   It's low-round when Laura, Laura, Laura, when it stands for long range wide.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.560]   Area network.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:45.980]   So what Amazon was doing was called, called low-ran or was it also lower-ran?
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.820]   It's also well, it, it's, it uses the Laura network.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:52.820]   That's it.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.820]   Laura.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.360]   But it doesn't, they've, they've put a proprietary protocol on it and they've done it actually
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.500]   for security reasons.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.000]   So you can't see what devices are communicating on the network.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.280]   So that's, that's why they are using sidewalk purportedly.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.640]   And here's an article from December.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:20.480]   The Laura Alliance is in talk with Amazon to switch sidewalk over to Laura Wann.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   So here's, here's.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   Which is non-proprietary.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.280]   That's basically the Alliance being like, come on Amazon.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.200]   You were a giant company.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.040]   Do not screw an open standard.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.920]   And Amazon's like, yeah, we'll listen to you.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.480]   And so the Alliance is like, okay, we're in talks.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.760]   So everyone gets excited, but you don't think that's going to happen.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.240]   Don't get that excited.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.760]   See, that's disappointing.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.800]   And I can say, you know, I, I'm not going to buy a sidewalk device or allow sidewalk.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.560]   I already turned it off because I don't want to support Amazon in that.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.160]   But if it were open like this helium thing, I think that's great.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:01.400]   We need this is going to, you know, Amazon gave a lot of good use cases, lost dogs and
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.320]   mailboxes and stuff, but I can think of a lot of uses.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.760]   If I, if I were here to shipping channels, I would definitely do it.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.320]   I, I turned on Laura's because I think it's important in the use cases are so compelling
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.040]   for having cheap access to low power, wide area internet access.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.080]   So I, I will use, I will, you know, do helium.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.160]   I will enable sidewalk.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.480]   And having sidewalk be non standard, non-prepared.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.120]   I think I don't.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.680]   It doesn't, it doesn't impinge on the ability of helium to do its thing.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   Obviously.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   And it doesn't hurt me.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   And if it, if it broadens the ecosystem and that's all I want.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   Right.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.680]   That's all I want, man.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.760]   Can you stay these, stay these podcasts?
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.840]   By the way, from December 17th discusses this whole, you know, Laura, Laura, Wann and
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.920]   the attempt to work with sidewalk.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.240]   We haven't heard anything since then.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   So.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.560]   Can you explain something to me?
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.440]   So is your router lining just because it's on and it don't do that because it's got nothing
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:14.680]   better to do or does the actual use of it as a router, as a, as a Wi-Fi router have some
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   impact on the mining.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.680]   I'm trying to see the relationship.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:17.680]   I don't get that.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   Oh, the relationship.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:25.240]   So it mines by saying, basically by saying, I am here and then other routers and saying
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   to other routers.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:32.760]   Hey, can you, can you basically run this proof to ensure that I am who I say I am and I have
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   coverage?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:40.120]   So it's not a traditional proof of work that Bitcoin or Ethereum does.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.960]   It's proof of connection.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.800]   It's proof of being like, I am on and this is my coverage range.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.920]   But you get a, you get a reward for that because you're supporting the network.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:58.400]   If you lived in Montana near no one who would end up using your signal, do you still mind?
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.400]   Yes.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.720]   And helium has a coverage map.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.680]   So you can see where everybody's routers are.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.360]   It's actually super public in a way that is a little uncomfortable.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.520]   Doesn't have your name associated with it, right?
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:16.840]   Yeah, they have all these crazy, crazy names like Bamboo sticker.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.840]   Okay.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.400]   So it's not, nobody could identify you.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.960]   Well, I mean, although we now know your Bamboo sticker panda, you could figure out mine pretty
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.800]   easily because there's not that many where I live.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.200]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:41.280]   But if you don't have one near you, it makes it harder to, I guess, earn as many tokens
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.960]   if you're doing it for money, money purposes because you earned them through your connections.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   Connections.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   Okay.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.960]   Right.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   Let's take a little break.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   We have a lot more to talk about.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.920]   This has been fascinating.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.560]   Thank you, Stacey.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   I appreciate it.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.360]   By the way, thanks also to Jason Howell who took over the show last week.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.360]   Yes.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   Great job.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   I really impressed it.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.360]   He's great.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.040]   Host of all about Android and our producer.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.800]   Our show today brought to you by the enterprise tech 30.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.000]   Now, if you listen to Stacey and you, or, you know, I think there are a lot of people
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.480]   going, okay, I'm going to wrap my writing down these companies that she talks about.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.960]   These companies are going to be hot.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.400]   I got something for you.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.760]   The enterprise tech 30.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.720]   It's a piece of seminal research developed by Wing Venture Capital in partnership with
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.200]   NASDAQ.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.840]   Part of the thing that's interesting about this is these are not public companies.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:38.560]   These are private companies, which means it's kind of hard to know what's going on in there
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.080]   because they're cagey about growth and revenue.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.440]   They don't have to publish it.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.080]   Sales cycles in some of these businesses can be long, arduous.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.920]   You don't know where on the ramp they are.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.920]   There are other lists.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:56.120]   I'm not going to deny that that feature startups or tech disruptors, but a couple of things
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   wrong with them.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.520]   First of all, it's really easy to lobby these lists.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:06.720]   So a lot of them really are basically either pay to play or heavily lobbied, not the enterprise
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720]   tech 30.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:13.600]   The other problem is, you know, they're often dominated by consumer brands or maybe even
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.680]   names everybody already knows, and that's how they made the list.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.200]   So that's why I want you to use the enterprise tech 30 because these are enterprise startups
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:30.000]   with the most potential to tectonically shift how enterprises operate for the better.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.720]   If you get into the ET 30, that means you are on a fast track, both of growth and of
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.960]   transformation in business, you're transforming how business is done.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.400]   And of course, you know, I know one of the reasons people pay attention to this, they're
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.520]   interested in the big exits or the IPOs that are coming along and all of these companies
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.640]   are on the track to that.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.040]   And you absolutely cannot lobby or buy your way onto the ET 30 effect.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:03.240]   You have to be selected by a very talented, very smart team of researchers.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.280]   The enterprise tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity to
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.320]   rather than just, you know, those companies everybody knows about.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.200]   The ET 30 should be considered a buying guide for enterprise executives seeking to bring
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.120]   more validated and credible digital innovation to their organizations.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:25.200]   These are vetted companies that are producing a product of real value that are on the right
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.700]   track.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.080]   And by the way, if you're on the ET 30, congratulations.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.320]   That's, you know, the highest endorsement of your current and future success.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.920]   And if you are in fact aspiring to build a publicly traded company, getting on the ET
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   30 is a major moment in your journey.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.160]   Tech executives and high performance operators use the list to help guide the decisions on
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.360]   what companies to join.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:55.480]   It's a really valuable list and it's fascinating to the 2021 edition of the enterprise tech
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.960]   30 from Wing Venture Capital and NASDAQ is out.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.960]   Just came out.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:08.320]   Over to enterprise tech 30, three zero enterprise tech 30, the number 30.com to see who made
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.920]   this year's list.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:15.360]   That's the enterprise tech 30.com now out from wing NASDAQ.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:21.320]   And we thank both wing and NASDAQ and the ET 30 for their support of this week in Google.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   Enterprise tech 30.com.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:30.840]   Yeah, I need you to explain the story to me.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.400]   The one in all caps.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.640]   No, I don't know who did that.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.200]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   Never.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.160]   Jason was screaming.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.680]   The CCMI story.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   Yes.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   Yes.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.040]   So, you know, last week of the, I guess the week before when I was here, we were talking
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.880]   about how exciting T-Mobile is going to support RCS, this rich communication services that
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   Google is pushing on Android messages.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:04.040]   It's to basically make it, you know, the Android messaging app as functional and as
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:10.480]   interesting, as useful as say Apple's messages or Telegram or one of the above.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.240]   And so we thought that was very good news.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:20.960]   Then the bad news because Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T were all working together on the cross-carrier
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:25.280]   messaging initiative for RCS.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.400]   And now they've decided to shut the doors.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   That's over.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.280]   It was originally slated to ship last year.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   Never happened.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   Now it never will.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   A spokesperson for Verizon confirmed the scoop by lightreading.com, quote, "The owners of
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:51.440]   the cross-carrier messaging initiative decided to end the joint venture effort."
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.000]   Because it was being nice to Google or what?
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.520]   Because these companies all hate each other.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.960]   They're all in competition.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.640]   And that's why we have such a fragmented system.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.760]   Nobody can, you know, there's nobody saying, "Oh, we should all use the same system."
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   No.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:10.520]   In fact, even, you know, this happened back in the IM wars.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.200]   You know, originally there were a number of programs that would let you go cross-platform
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.560]   on all the IMs and IMs companies put up silos.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.400]   A lot of them died because of it so that they wouldn't be part of that.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   And I don't know.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   Would you agree, Stacey?
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.400]   You follow this.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.960]   I hate this stuff.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.160]   It drives me absolutely bonkers.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.800]   And there's a very clear business reason.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.680]   I mean, what Tim Cook was in his, he was talking about like why they don't open up
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.360]   messages to Android users.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.280]   It's like, well, it's only reason people can not kids buy phones.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   That's right.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.920]   It was Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.920]   Oh, that's fair.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:53.400]   It was depositions and emails revealed in the discovery during the Epic versus Apple battle.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.840]   But it was, you know, everybody kind of knew the reason Apple doesn't make messages for
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:02.040]   Android is it's a, you know, they want that competitive wall exclusivity.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.720]   And they, but they even said that the smoking gun was in this email saying, well, we don't
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.200]   want parents to buy Android phones for their kids.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.400]   These $50 Android phones, we want them to have iPhones.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.360]   And in fact, they turns out they actually had an Android app ready to go and decided
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   not to release it.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.400]   Probably the same for FaceTime.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.680]   But yeah, any communication, it drives me nuts.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.760]   Like communication technologies, communication should be free and open.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.760]   Right.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.960]   This is like what people want to do.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:38.080]   And using it as a cudgel to like lock people, it not a cudgel as a barrier, a wall, ha ha
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.520]   to put to lock people in your ecosystem is just wrong.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.200]   Well, it's good business probably.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.920]   But I do have to point out that that's how email was.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:51.200]   Jeff and I are old enough to remember MCI mail, remember, which didn't talk to anything
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.320]   but MCI mail and genie and cop use serving.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.800]   They all had their own mail systems, but nobody would talk to anybody else, which made it
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.600]   not very useful.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.800]   And at some point, for some reason, it was just agreed, all right, we should federate.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:10.320]   I remember the big deal when you could send AOL mail to other people on other services.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.120]   Maybe that was the ruin of it all.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.680]   Now that you mentioned it, that's when email went down.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.960]   Because then anybody could send anything to anybody.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.120]   Well, and you had it like with IM, remember Jabber.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.360]   But then remember that, you know, and by the way, they're gone.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.440]   AIM and I are ICQ still around, but a lot of these guys said, no, no, no, we don't want
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.480]   to interoperate.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.160]   I think company, it's understandable.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.280]   Companies want to silo.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   Users want interoperability.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.880]   Users want to be able to, I want to, I want a messenger that I like that will talk to
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.320]   everybody else in my family.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.880]   We don't have that.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.000]   No, and you probably won't get it unless Congress decides that that's how you have to do it.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.120]   Does government have to force it?
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.440]   Or threatened it.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.760]   Like threatened it in a way that is like, you know, actually threatening, is supposed
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.800]   to like, and then they'll be like, okay, fine.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.200]   So the bigger, the bigger question that is why these carriers even considered CCMI, you
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.240]   know, why they started it in the first place.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:18.560]   I have to point out that SMS is cross platform, text messaging, because each carrier has a
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.080]   gateway to the other carriers, because they realized, in fact, it wasn't always that way.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.880]   In the early days of SMS, it never took off in the US until they did that, because if
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.120]   you were a T-Mobile customer, you could only text message other T-Mobile customers.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.520]   If you were Verizon customer, you're stuck there until they got those gateways in and
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.160]   are operated, which wasn't, it's in my memory.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.880]   It wasn't that long ago.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.920]   This is what I remember.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.520]   Text messaging was huge everywhere but the US.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.040]   Everybody talked about text messaging in Europe and Asia.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.240]   We didn't do it because it was useless.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.200]   Well, the end was expensive.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.480]   And oh, and that's another thing.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:58.240]   Although the cost was like, remember it was like a dollar or a quarter of a text?
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   Yeah, it was really expensive.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.120]   So they solved that.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.200]   But the problem is SMS is nowhere near the capabilities of the database messengers that
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   we see now.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.840]   And that was what RCS was supposed to do.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.000]   And you know, the carriers have been dragging their feet with RCS.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.560]   So would RCS have created that single message?
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.880]   Well, that was the idea.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   That was the plan.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.600]   You want to get mad at technology companies folks?
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   Start with your phone company.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   Start there.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.080]   Oh, I hate the phone companies.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.800]   Yeah, they're giant.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.440]   Most of us do get mad at phone companies and cable companies.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.600]   And by the way, this is called this week in Google and kudos to Google, which came up
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   with RCS.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:44.160]   Actually, I think they bought a company, but they were the big proponents of RCS.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.640]   They've been the ones that have been pushing it.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   I'm going to go back to my question.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.840]   Was this a part a way to say screw Google or was it really screw all you guys?
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.840]   It's just a scroll.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.280]   Yeah, we hate y'all.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.760]   But I think it's important to point out that there are good business reasons to do that,
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:01.880]   but there might be better business reasons to interoperate.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:08.680]   And there are some examples like email and SMS where interoperability made these technologies
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.280]   take off.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.600]   Yes.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:20.000]   The other thing that is important is Google's RCS in Android Messenger is end-to-end encrypted.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.840]   And that's another thing I think users really want.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.840]   Big plus.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:29.240]   But it's not, it's always signals, so are a lot of things, but it's not any good if it's
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   not cross-platform.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   All right.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.800]   It's cross-carrier.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.560]   It's too bad.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.200]   It's really a shame.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:45.240]   Google's, I think as far as I know, still big on S, RCS, Rich Communication Services.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.240]   But to what end?
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   Well, without the carrier.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.840]   But carriers have always been the minimal.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.600]   It's just another messenger.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   Well, okay.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.240]   And Google has enough of those.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   God, yes.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.880]   Dumb questions continue.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   There might be.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.960]   There's another reason to do this for the carriers, which is that SMS is a technology rides
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.920]   and Stacey, correct me, because you know all this stuff much better than I do.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.640]   But it rides on the voice channels.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.640]   It's not a data.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.080]   It doesn't use data, although everything's using data now.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.320]   It uses data.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.800]   It does now, I guess.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   But it's not what we call as data service.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:28.040]   It's always distinct from the data services, whereas messenger, RCS, WhatsApp, Telegram,
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.400]   signal, they all use just pure data.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   They don't.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.200]   And that's why it's a problem with SMS.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.480]   SMS is the lingua franca.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:40.920]   Every smartphone has SMS capability, but nobody wants to use that.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   That's a mess.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   I use SMS.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.600]   I use it too.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.840]   That's why I was pitching two weeks ago that Hangouts went away.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.600]   Actually, it was actually wasn't on this show, but it was last week.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.600]   It was on Twitter.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   It was on Twitter.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   I wasn't.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.280]   I was really mad because while we were in calistoga, all of a sudden Hangouts dies.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.920]   And I don't have my pixel phone with me.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:05.680]   I count on Hangouts so that I could get my Android messages, which are the Google fine
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.680]   number.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:12.960]   It's the public number I use on my iPhone that Hangouts dies because Google whoops.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.240]   And so I went on this search for replacement.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.120]   I ended up getting a program.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.520]   It's not a great replacement, but it's better than nothing called pulse.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.040]   If I look, I heard you mentioned that Sunday on a show.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   Is it working for you?
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.320]   Because I'm, I'm considering it's not working around.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.800]   Unfortunately, Apple does not allow them to have an iOS app.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.320]   Of course.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:41.200]   So you have to use a progressive web app, a website, but it's not working well.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   I know.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   It works everywhere else.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.720]   It works on the desktop.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   It works on Linux.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:51.560]   There are other solutions, but like for instance, Signal only works on one thing at a time.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.640]   I want the same message to appear on all my devices.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.920]   So when my daughter who is using Android texts me on Hangouts, well, was Hangouts, but texts
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:05.320]   my Android number, I can see that everywhere and respond everywhere is hanging out now dead
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   for that purpose.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.320]   Yeah, it's dead.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   Dead.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   You're a Google fine user, right?
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.200]   Remember Google fine users, Hangouts lasted longer than anywhere else.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.880]   It no, I just know it stopped working.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.680]   I couldn't text my daughter anymore.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.680]   Wow.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.880]   I still have Hangouts in my email program.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.440]   Yeah, but it's trying to send us not to SMS though.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   That's the thing.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.440]   That's the video calls.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.160]   Well, they've replaced that with Google.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.840]   They've replaced that with Google chat.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:42.000]   So if I try so I can do it with when I can send instant messages via Hangouts, but if
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.360]   I go to like to a voice or a video call, it goes to me.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   It's very strange.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.760]   So it's chat and meet is what they're hoping that you'll use instead of Hangouts.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:55.400]   And I think they must have turned off the Hangouts server because I kept typing in messages
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.720]   in Hangout and said fail to send fail to send fail to send.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.720]   So I don't know.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.920]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.920]   It's disappointing.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.520]   You want to talk about other interoperability?
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.080]   Perhaps in the smart home?
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.080]   Yes.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.440]   Are you talking about for chip?
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.960]   Why yes, I am.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:20.760]   So CCMI is dead, but chip is alive and well.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.060]   Exactly.
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.120]   What's the chip news?
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:31.720]   Project Connected Home Over IP was created by Google, Amazon, Apple and Samsung back in
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.160]   December 20, no December 2019.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.480]   And the idea was to create an interoperable platform or interoperable protocol for the
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.280]   smart home.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.760]   And we all were like, y'all were like, this is never going to work.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.720]   And I was like, oh, guys, it might.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.920]   And so I don't hold on.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.320]   We said this is never going to work, but I personally said this is never going to work,
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.000]   but I hope it does.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.360]   OK, and it was like sure Stacey.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:03.120]   I also hope it will, but get your head out of the clouds.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.440]   Well, suck it up Stacey.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.880]   It's not going to work.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.720]   So with the pandemic striking soon after that, they had said it was going to take a
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   year.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:20.440]   Actually, what they did is this week they came out and said, all right, it'll be out
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:26.600]   in December or late 2021 is when the certificate or the spec will be publicly available and
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.520]   the certification will start.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:34.360]   So they're like two years, you know, or a year late, but the pandemic did change things.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.840]   This week they also, but they finally talked about things like, here's how it's going to
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   work.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:44.040]   It's going to use thread for low bandwidth applications in the home.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.360]   So Apple putting thread in their home pod mini.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.120]   I always have a hard time with this.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.120]   Like Eve, the way they do their thread with home kit sensors for Eve stuff, all that's
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.720]   going to be probably moved right into chip.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.680]   Wi-Fi is going to be for high bandwidth applications.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.880]   They're going to support it.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.520]   And it also supports ethernet.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.800]   And they're also going to support the following device classes.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.360]   Very exciting.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.160]   Let me find them so I don't tell you the wrong device classes.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:21.160]   Okay, lighting, blinds, HVAC televisions, access controls like door locks, and then safety
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:28.040]   and security products and access points, smart home controllers and ridges.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.440]   What they're not going to support though are things like cameras.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.200]   I was just about to have.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:43.600]   They're going to tell you it's because cameras are complicated.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.720]   Like a light bulb, you're like, it can only do a limited set number of things, right?
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.640]   You're like, turn on, dim, turn off, maybe change colors, right?
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.560]   And tune, you know, a camera, they're like, you know, you could turn it off.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.560]   You could turn on.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560]   There's motion.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.160]   There's certain types of motion.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.480]   There's a lot more happening there.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.840]   From a data model perspective is what they tell me.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:13.480]   I think though, it's because a camera feed is a wonderful way to lock someone into your
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   ecosystem.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.480]   But that's just the.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.800]   The cynical space.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.000]   That's the the ant-proode version of Stacey.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.520]   That's me listening to my inner ant.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.920]   I'm not cynical.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   I'm just realistic.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   There you go.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.640]   That's exactly what a cynical person would say.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.920]   So I went into like all this stuff.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.440]   There's all the answers on backwards compatibility.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.360]   And we can expect these devices hopefully by the end of this year.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.840]   Oh, and this is really exciting.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.960]   They're integrating security into the standard.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:55.400]   So they're going to integrate encryption as part of this standard and software over there
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.480]   are software updates and they've got a little blockchain component that everyone's excited
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480]   about.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.760]   But really it's just a distributed ledger to track like the provenance of a device and
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.920]   how often it gets updated.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.800]   But people are very excited because blockchain.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.760]   Is there anybody left out of this alliance who should be there?
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.000]   Well, there's now 180 member companies.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.640]   So there are smaller companies that are not part of it.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.720]   But all the big guys are there.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.080]   And that doesn't mean they're not going to support it.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.080]   They just don't mean me.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.440]   Don't want to pay the association fee.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.280]   Yeah, they may not be there yet.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.040]   Can they support it without being a member of the alliance or the project?
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.520]   That's just the working group, right?
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.480]   So right now, if you want to see the spec and participate, you have to be part of the alliance.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:52.800]   When it becomes public in later this year, I believe you can implement it without, but
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.040]   you're still going to have to pay for testing and certification and all that fun stuff.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040]   Fascinating.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:05.080]   Sorry, I was so excited about this because for consumers, this means like these devices
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:11.000]   will just work together, theoretically.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.880]   I think this is good.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880]   It's a good thing.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.720]   Yeah, it'll be nice to see this in action.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.240]   Maybe the carrier should come.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.040]   Pay attention.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.200]   And, you know, I'm just doing a little plug here.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.480]   The story on my site is, oh, and scooter X, thank you, scooter X.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.960]   There's a ton of information in there.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.600]   And then this week in the newsletter, I'm totally, y'all are getting like a sneak preview.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.800]   There's going to be scoops on chip in the newsletter from different vendors on what
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   they're doing with it.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.840]   And then there's also my helium story, but y'all just heard it.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.960]   So don't tell anybody.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   We now know.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.920]   Y'all can skip that.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.480]   Y'all can skip the helium story.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.400]   I don't need to talk about that.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   Well, good.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   Thank you.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   We knew you were excited about chip.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.760]   And I'm glad to hear that there is actually some future there.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   You can read about it.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:11.360]   Of course, it's Stacey on IoT project chip embraces the timeline and the blockchain.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:17.200]   And there's the, there's the clear as mud pyramid chip pyramid.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.840]   So basically what this, yeah, everyone hates this.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.840]   I hate it too.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.000]   Basically they're just saying, you know what?
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.280]   People are all familiar standards at the radio level.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.040]   This isn't the application level.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:34.320]   So if that means something to you, I mean, I don't, it may or may not.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.800]   What does it mean to people?
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.040]   Well, yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.440]   Basically it'll run over a bunch of different radios.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   Wi-Fi.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:47.920]   We may finally get to, you know, a point where home automation is more universal and things
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.720]   just interoperate with one another, which would be a huge step forward.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.480]   And then the lights switch without going, does this work with home?
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.480]   Is it work with that?
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.480]   So annoying.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:03.560]   And by the way, there is a perfect example industry folk of why you want to do this.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.680]   I think you had to do it in home automation.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.760]   That's why they had to do this.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.120]   That's why they, and it took them for freaking ever, like five or six years of them pushing
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.600]   their siloed view and consumers saying, no, no, no.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600]   Because really home automation never took off.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.000]   It's been around for more than a decade.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.320]   But the fact that it was a tower of Babel just stopped people cold.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.320]   They buy some stuff and realize nothing interoperated and go, oh, screw it.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.480]   I want 18 hubs in my house.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.320]   And that was that.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:38.360]   And especially after the voice assistants came out, because then people want, started to
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.040]   want scripts.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.960]   They wanted actions where they could say, good night.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.160]   Hello echo, good night.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.400]   And everything would turn off and the garage door would close.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.440]   And none of that works if things don't interoperate.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.640]   And so I think that's really when it started to happen.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   Do you agree?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   Stacey, it was voice.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.880]   Yes, that is 100% why.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.000]   And shortcuts on iOS and the, you know, I can't remember what Google calls those home shortcuts,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.880]   but those things started to really become something people wanted.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:13.400]   I guess that's why Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint don't have to interoperate because
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:18.920]   nobody's saying they ought to be, but there's not the drum beat to get them to go.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.200]   And so there's not actual consumer buying power.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.760]   You're either going to buy an iPhone.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760]   That's right.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.840]   You don't buy something because of that.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.040]   That's exactly right.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.320]   And, you know, by the way, who was it?
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.320]   I was listening.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:37.840]   Was it all about Android where they were saying, yeah, I am still constantly discriminated against
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.320]   over being a green bubble.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.400]   That was missed.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   I said that.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.880]   And that's I blame you, Apple.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:54.000]   Well, you could also blame, I mean, discrimination.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.640]   I mean, like if your friends are really like, it's your friends.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   How much?
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.640]   True.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.640]   They're the problem.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.640]   I agree.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   You just need to sit down with them and have a real, you know, a real talk.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.560]   I was in a chat room when that conversation came up and I basically said, you know, in
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:12.720]   my tiny circle of plus over 40 people, that conversation never comes up.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.720]   Who cares?
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.720]   Everybody's a green bubble.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.720]   It's young.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.160]   Everybody's a person.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.160]   Everybody's messages getting out.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.160]   Tea.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.800]   I think it's a teenager thing.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.800]   Yes.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.800]   It is.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.080]   And there are, I remember my son when my son was in a frat at CU Boulder, I asked, I
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.520]   was doing some research and I asked him, so iPhones, Android phones, said we all have
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   iPhones except for one kid was an Android phone.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.720]   And because he's a green bubble, he can't be in our group chats on messages.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.400]   So he misses out on all the events.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:54.320]   He never gets invited to the events and hence everybody in the front has to have an iPhone.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.320]   It's things like that.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   That's just that cloud.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.040]   Download WhatsApp, man.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.640]   But then you have to talk to everybody at the front and say, okay, now folks, don't send
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   a message.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.560]   You got to use WhatsApp and they're going to go, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560]   that's the right person.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.560]   We figured that out real quick.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.560]   What do you use?
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.040]   Well, like the parents of my daughter's school, we were in a big WhatsApp group because exactly
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   that issue.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   And you know what?
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:23.040]   We all got.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.040]   So everybody just got WhatsApp.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.680]   See, I'd be the guy that goes, but I don't want to use a Facebook product.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680]   I'd be that.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.680]   Well, that's fair.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.680]   You would be that guy.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.480]   I refuse to use it.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.760]   And I'd be the guy saying, what if we use signal instead?
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.680]   And everybody said, so WhatsApp is great.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.040]   Yeah, of course you could do everything on everything.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.640]   There's no other guy that says my email address is showing someone.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.040]   There is and I can't get anybody to use this either.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:58.160]   There is a really good end to end encryption chat program that uses email called Delta
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160]   chat.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   Yes.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.080]   And so when somebody chats with you at Delta chat, it's Delta.chat.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:10.840]   It comes in as an email except that your conversation in the Delta chat app, Android iOS,
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.040]   both, and desktop shows up like it.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.960]   This is email, but it shows up like a chat.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.760]   I think that's a really good way.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.000]   That's totally interoperable.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   That's fine.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.880]   Don't you think?
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.880]   Isn't that?
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880]   I think that's cool.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.440]   No, I can't get anybody to use that either.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440]   No, you won't.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.400]   And it's end to end encrypted, by the way.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400]   You just PGP.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400]   I really...
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.240]   Well, my next crime spree, I'll use that.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240]   Thank you.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   Yeah, I know.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.120]   That's the other thing is everybody talks about encryption like, oh, I got to have encryption.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120]   No, nobody's...
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120]   Nobody...
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120]   What?
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   You guys?
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120]   Okay.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.560]   This is big news sort of.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.920]   Let me sell this, but this is actually worth talking about.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.760]   Can I talk about it?
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.840]   Take a break and we will talk about it when we come back.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.840]   How about that?
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:10:59.840]   Okay.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.560]   Because I got to talk about Linux.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.840]   You know me in Linux.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.080]   Love the Linux.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.240]   You know me in the cloud.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.320]   Love the cloud.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.720]   Now the two great tastes have come together, actually not now.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.960]   Linux has been around for ages.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.160]   I've been a Linux subscriber probably for 10 years.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:24.320]   Linux was one of the first cloud server systems to use SSDs, all Linux all the time.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.080]   It is a great solution for anybody who wants to host a website, build an app, store, backup,
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.400]   media, launch and enrich your developer applications.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.240]   It's great for DevOps, for CI/CD.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.880]   It's great for hosted services, AI even.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   They have machine learning nodes, gaming services.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.920]   It's cloud computing developers, not just trust, but love.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:54.200]   That's why 800,000 developers choose Linux, including little all me.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.320]   Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linux virtual machines.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.040]   Develop deploy and scale your modern applications faster and easier.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.120]   Of course you can have a dedicated compute instance if you want or save money with a
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.520]   shared instance or use your $100 credit, which I'm going to tell you about.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:19.240]   In a second on an S3 compatible object storage or managed Kubernetes or whatever you need.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.560]   I love the cloud manager at Linode.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.080]   So easy to use.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.320]   They have a full featured API as well.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.840]   So it works really anywhere, anytime.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.640]   Data centers all over the world.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.000]   And I love this about Linode.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.040]   They don't charge you more for certain locations.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.680]   Same simple consistent pricing globally.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.160]   So just choose the data center closest to you because you're going to get the same great
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.160]   deal no matter where you are.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.640]   And the customer support is superb.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.920]   Even if you, like me, have a small plan.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.840]   I find Linode very affordable, just a few bucks a month.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.000]   It gives me everything I need to do, development to practice, to learn things, websites, all
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.100]   of that stuff.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.880]   And the support team doesn't say, "Oh, you're a $5 a month guy."
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   No, no, no.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:09.920]   For me, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, no tearing, no handoffs.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.240]   When you get that support rep on the line, she's going to get it working right the first
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240]   time.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.360]   I just love that.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.240]   Check out Linode's great YouTube channel, by the way, for video tutorials, security
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.000]   tips, everything you need to know at youtube.com/linode.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.920]   It's L-I-N-O-D-E.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.080]   Like Linux Node.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   Get it.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.080]   L-I-N-O-D-E.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   Just some testimonials, Bryce Adams, meteoric.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.880]   He says, "From the start, we were looking for a partner, not a provider, some of the
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.680]   large providers, some of the three letter providers.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.080]   See us only as a transaction.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.720]   Linode is the kind of partner that will be with us from the start today and beyond.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.440]   It's what people love.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.960]   Linode, multiple Stevie Award winners for their customer and sales service.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.760]   In fact, they've won it three years in a row now.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.240]   Simplify your infrastructure.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.440]   Cut your cloud bills in half with Linode's Linux virtual machines.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.720]   Whether you're developing a personal project like me or managing larger workloads, you
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.560]   deserve simple, affordable, accessible cloud computing solutions.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.840]   I love Linode, but a happy Linode customer forever.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.320]   Get started on Linode today with $100 in free credit.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.320]   Yeah, a hundred bucks.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.960]   That'll go a long way.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.680]   That's because you're listening to Twig.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.440]   Go to linode.com/twig to find out more.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.760]   linode.com/twig.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.840]   Click that free account button right there after you enter your primary email or you
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.360]   could text Twit to 47, 47, 47, and the same thing will work.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.120]   Twit, 47, 47, 47, it's a short code.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.120]   Linode.com/twig.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.440]   If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.880]   More and more, I'm a Linux fan and having Linux available in the cloud is so great.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880]   So great.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.760]   Thank you, Linode.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.560]   Linode.com/twig.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:15.600]   It was kind of what you were talking about earlier with operating systems in order to
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.720]   become secure, locking you down more and more and more.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.880]   I've just started to decide that I feel like Apple's nannying me.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.400]   I feel like Windows is nannying me.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.080]   And Linux just treats you like a grownup.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.080]   Like...
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   So it was Chrome.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.080]   You know what you're doing?
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.360]   Well, Chrome treats you like a grownup in a playpen.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.440]   It's a fine playpen right out of the worry about all this crap.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.000]   Yeah, well, no.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   You know what?
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.340]   Somebody like you, you want...
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.000]   Priority 1 is safe, secure, working, right?
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.200]   For me, I like to mess around with my stuff.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.960]   I don't want anybody telling me what I can and cannot do.
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.740]   And so Linux, I go to the command line and if I want to erase my hard drive, I can gosh
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.640]   darn it, I can erase my hard drive.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:06.080]   Yeah, it's funny to hear you say that, but yet you are also an iOS proponent.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.600]   You love it.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:12.760]   You know, I preferred Android for years because it was more flexible and configurable, but
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.280]   I feel like it's getting janky in its old age.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.720]   There's that.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.960]   And I don't like janky.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.160]   Janky, the desktop's a little different than janky on a phone.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.040]   The phone needs to be an appliance.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.760]   I'm sorry, but it kind of does.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]   And with you.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   Compute desktop.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760]   I'm just joking.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.760]   I'm going to give you a hard time.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.400]   Yeah, I got Linux pretty locked down.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.480]   Pretty lab.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:43.520]   It's running nice on my nice Ryzen 7 5800 with our 5900.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:49.280]   No, I guess I got 5800 with an NVIDIA GTX 3080.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.200]   Yes, sweetie.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.800]   Although I still have to keep windows on there because whenever I have to update the Alienware
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.640]   firmware, I have to go.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.000]   Oh, yeah, I don't know that.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.840]   But I have a little Windows partition.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:01.840]   Great, big window.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.840]   Linux partition.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.880]   And my game that I play Valheim runs beautifully on it.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   I'm loving it.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.640]   It's so much fun.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.080]   You may need to check out some open source gaming, but it's actually just a good open
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   source.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.480]   There is some good open source gaming.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:23.480]   Valheim is Linux first, which it's not open source, but their developer develops on Linux.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.480]   There's a Windows version.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.560]   It plays pretty much the same on Windows or Linux.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.080]   I've tried it on both.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.360]   So it's at least Linux is a peer to Windows in this regard.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360]   There are a few of them.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   In fact, Father Robert was on Sunday.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.200]   I don't know if you heard.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.920]   He's got his big server.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.160]   Yeah, where are they?
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.360]   He's got TF2 on it.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.440]   He's got TF2, which by the way, source code Lake.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440]   Oh, really?
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:59.040]   And as a result, immediately malware, cheats, all sorts of stuff.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.360]   There is some funny stuff in the source code, though.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.720]   Here's a tech radar story about it.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.720]   Remote quote execution.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.560]   I was actually just trying to pull it off.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.640]   Yeah, are they do open source gaming gaming?
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.640]   Yep.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   Inless Sky.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.640]   Oh, it's open source.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   It's open source.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.680]   Let me show you my open source.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.680]   Like butter.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.680]   Isn't he good?
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.280]   Is he like butter?
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.200]   Get the guys on from 0AD, okay?
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.480]   Because this is also open source Linux gaming.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.080]   That's basically one of my favorite games, Age of Empires.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.680]   It is such a good implementation.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:42.560]   Even though they say they're completely beta, it's very, as is Valentine, by the way.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.040]   It's very stable and so much fun to play.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:50.280]   The man, the graphics and everything, it looks, it's just a, if you liked Age of Empires,
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.000]   0AD, now with improved flora.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.440]   I wonder if they use Glender.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440]   You know they might well.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.920]   I mean, it's a very open source, he kind of thing.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.520]   You make a note because I'd love to hear you guys talk with the 0AD guys.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.520]   Yep.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.320]   Because it's a really neat project.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.400]   It's been going on for years and years and years.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.640]   But that is actually one of the open source games I play all the time, 0AD.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.200]   All right, Stacey, I've been teasing you.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   I've been mean.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   I've been dragging this out.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   What?
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.720]   You're going to feel so bad when you find out what it is.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.720]   What happened?
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.720]   Okay.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.000]   You know how hot car deaths are a big deal, right?
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.720]   Like people leave in their kids, babies in cars.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:38.560]   The SEC just approved waivers for six different companies to build in car radar that will
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.800]   be able to detect passengers in the car and let people know.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.800]   So this is a huge deal.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.960]   That was a waiver needed.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.440]   Because it's radar.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.320]   Yeah, it's a spectrum and they're like, okay, so they're going to operate.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.160]   It's 60 gigahertz spectrum.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.200]   Doesn't your car have a backseat warning though?
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.720]   Both of our cars do.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.280]   They don't do it fancy with radar.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.400]   They just if you open the back door and closed it again before during the ride, they just
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:12.240]   they, my car beep and Lisa's car Chevy bolt and my Mustang monkey both beep the horn and
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.080]   say, there's something in the backseat.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.080]   You left something in the backseat.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   Mine does not do that.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.080]   I think I think many modern cars do, but this would be a better word.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.000]   I thought the horn beep was that you'd lock the car.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   I never knew what the meeting of the car is.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   I don't have it.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.400]   Now you got two reasons.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.240]   There is a beep when the car is locked as well.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.080]   But well then, how do you know the difference?
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   Right.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.000]   It's different cars locked by kids in the back.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.480]   It's a different beat.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.320]   It's a different beat.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.800]   It's a longer beep if there's somebody in the truck.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.800]   Oh, it's like more.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   I mean, that's like a backseat.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800]   It doesn't tell you.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.800]   But more is code.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.800]   That's not very good for anybody.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.800]   How many men make shenanigans?
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.560]   Nobody's in my truck.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.200]   I swear to God, it's the lock.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.200]   It's the lock.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:02.960]   Anyway, I just thought that was exciting because it's as someone who's been around IOT forever.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.960]   It's huge.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.520]   It's like such an easy problem to solve it.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.760]   Oh my God, we haven't solved it.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.760]   So good use of technology.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   Okay.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:16.240]   So it's supposed to be in cars by 2025 as an industry mandate.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.680]   So it could be earlier, obviously, in fancy or cars.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.680]   But that's not...
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:23.520]   It's not a good name, the hot car trigger alert.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.720]   Yeah, but you know.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.720]   Anyway, okay.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.720]   That's it.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.120]   I'm hijacking all the green things.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.840]   I should just color all mine green.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.880]   Oh no, if they're green, they're golden.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880]   If you will.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   So if we're in the government section, do we want to talk about how stupid the White
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.760]   House is being about the chip shortage?
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:50.120]   See, notice, by the way, I'm not saying to Stacy, it's not a democracy, Jeff.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.080]   I only say that to you.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.080]   I know.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.080]   I know.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.280]   That's because I'll yell at him.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.280]   I'll be like, finally.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.280]   Stacy, it's a democracy.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.520]   So this was on Monday.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.880]   Biden got all the chip companies to come to the White House, not that there was anything
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.320]   he could do short term, but...
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.240]   So it was a flop?
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.840]   Well, there's just nothing you can do.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.840]   It's basically...
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.840]   This is like politics right here, in the sense that you have a fair...
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.240]   Well, there's something you can do.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.640]   You can allocate federal funds.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.040]   I think they allocated $100 billion, right?
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040]   Or $50 billion.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.040]   Yes, but it's...
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.680]   Yeah, but it's not going to change anything for a long time.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.360]   No, because you've got to build plants and stuff.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.360]   Right.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   So, and this is kind of like...
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.080]   I mean, this is Europe, Europe, the government's in Germany and...
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.400]   Yeah, they're doing it.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.400]   Plants, maybe.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:51.320]   They all sent email, emails, letters to Taiwan, and we're like, "Hey, can you make chips again
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.560]   so we can get our automotive industry on the road?"
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560]   It's a mess.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.560]   And it's not going to fix it in 2021, and it's not going to fix it in 2022.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.560]   Really?
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.560]   It is.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:10.680]   2022 is actually when they're thinking, "Most of the chip CEOs, TSMC and Intel and..."
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.160]   I can't remember the other one.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.160]   Qualcomm.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.800]   "The middle of 2022, we should see..."
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.240]   Start getting out of this.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:22.680]   Yeah, TSMC is building a $12 billion Arizona plant this year that might be online next
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680]   year.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.400]   So, as Intel, they've got two plants slated.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.920]   TSMC's spending $100 billion.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:37.640]   Things trying to get Congress to back a $50 billion fund for this.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:42.840]   And I think this is exactly what we should be doing instead of tariffs and saying, "We
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.720]   hate you, China."
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.040]   Start building fabs in the US.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.400]   I misspoke.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.200]   Pat Gelsinger, who's the CEO at Intel, said it will go beyond 2022.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200]   Oh, it's...
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.920]   Yeah, because it takes a while to do these things.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:58.920]   Yes, it's it.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.920]   It's not this year anyway.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.120]   What is the darned infrastructure bill?
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120]   Micron.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.560]   That's who you're thinking of, right?
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.560]   Micron?
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.760]   No?
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.400]   That's another American chip manufacturer.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.200]   I think it was...
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.200]   SM...
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.680]   What is the TSMC of...
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.160]   There's another fab.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.720]   It was another foundry that talked about it.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.800]   So companies at this event included TSMC, who originally wasn't going to send somebody
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.520]   but they changed their mind.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:34.320]   GM CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Company CEO James Farley and Sundar Pichari, Pichai of company.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.480]   I think Google, is that the name of it?
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.400]   Seems like a childish name, but okay.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.400]   They were all there.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.640]   I'm not sure why Sundar was there, but anyway, they were all there.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.320]   But so were the manufacturing powers.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:55.200]   Dell and Intel, Medtronic, Northrop Grumman, HP, Cummins, Micron, TSMC, AT&T, Samsung Electronics.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.240]   So I think this is a very positive...
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.000]   Yes, you're not going to fix this tomorrow.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.720]   You got to build plants.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.800]   And they're very expensive, but I think it's a very positive move, don't you think?
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   We need to do this.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.600]   Well, I think it was...
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.160]   Everybody, we already knew that you needed to build plants.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:17.240]   The issues around building the plants isn't...
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.880]   But you want government support, you want government funding.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.880]   The government...
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.160]   So the government has been fairly supportive.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.640]   I know they have pulled back in the last probably...
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.320]   Under Trump, it was mostly tariffs.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:35.800]   And it was mostly tariffs that American citizens paid because that's how tariffs work.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.800]   Yes.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.840]   Outside of tariffing, we have had a lack of investment by chip firms because fabs are
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:48.160]   so expensive and you need to run them all the time.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.720]   Intel going to a foundry model is going to help them.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.120]   They're not going to a foundry model.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.680]   Pat Gelsinger said that they were opening up their plants for foundry services.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.160]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   Yes, they are...
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.160]   But they're building a lot of new plants in your right.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.000]   They hope to make those plants work by building them for other people.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.240]   Just six months ago Intel had...
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.240]   Sure, Intel.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:16.000]   Yeah, just six months ago, Wall Street investors were coming after Intel for investing in plants.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   So this isn't a lack of government support.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   It's a lack of CEO...
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.320]   Intel was going to let Gelsinger make the decision.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.280]   Everybody expected that they would become fabulous like Nvidia or R.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.760]   I never expected it.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.560]   No, and I think it's very good for America that they said, no, we're going to in fact
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.360]   spend a lot of money to build two plants in Phoenix.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.560]   We're going to keep our Oregon plant.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.160]   I think they're going to keep their Oregon plant going, although it's a little out of
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.480]   date.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.680]   The problem is Intel's process is still 14 nanometers.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.920]   And they're saying, and Pat Gelsinger's saying, yeah, we're going to sell chips to Apple.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.480]   Oh, yeah, I bet.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:03.120]   Meanwhile, TSMC in Taiwan is cranking out five nanometers, next generation three nanometers.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.240]   I'm glad to see though that they're going to invest in the US.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.520]   And it's things like that.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.080]   It's diplomacy.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.720]   It's going to TSMC and saying, here, we're going to give you some money, some tax breaks,
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.840]   remember, build a plant in Arizona, please.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.400]   That helps us in other ways too, but it's not only manufacturing the US, but it helps
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.880]   us because we don't know what the situation is going to be with China, even with Taiwan
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   down the road.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.480]   Or look at shipping issues.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.360]   I mean, you don't ship chips on an airplane in via armored car.
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.920]   However, you, I mean, if you think about building for resiliency in terms of like climate change
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.040]   in terms of global, I mean, it does make sense.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:48.720]   I would also say though, that even if Intel, well, their new stuff won't be, but not everything
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.720]   has to be made at three nanometers, right?
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.720]   I mean, yeah.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720]   Oh gosh, no.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.720]   Advanced memory.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.200]   But I mean, we still have, you know, if I look at like IOT chips, the chips in your
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:03.800]   router, car chips, those are like, not coming from Intel, like a bad news for you.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:07.280]   Well, yeah, those are those are infinity on in those companies, but those are those
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.800]   are not way down the process.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.000]   No, it's optimistic of Intel to say we're going to be coming.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.640]   Yeah, Foundry, but good luck guys.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.640]   I hope you do.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.600]   I mean, we need, we need it's good until needs to succeed.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.560]   I think Intel, Reuters actually, not Reuters, Bloomberg had a great story on what went wrong
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.840]   and Intel and everyone should read it because it is a management case.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:36.440]   It's a case study in how to like screw up a innovative company, an old innovative company
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   too.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.320]   Brian Christinich.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:45.720]   I am so excited the creators of Bridget's, Bridget and the musical on TikTok have signed
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.560]   a deal with creative artists associates.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.880]   I know, I know, and this is going to make you so happy.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   Good for them.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   Good for them.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.640]   It's a very, it's a very musical musical clip.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:58.640]   I think you should play it.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.640]   Where's the clip?
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640]   Is it on this article?
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.640]   You put it on there.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.640]   Keep scrolling.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.640]   Oh, here we go.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   This is for you.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:10.640]   Ant Pruitt.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.000]   I got to fix this.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.160]   I apologize.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.200]   I'm having the Linux problem.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.200]   Linux.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.760]   Oh, my audio.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:19.760]   I can fix it.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.000]   Do you mind if I take a moment?
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   I got to go to terminal.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.200]   I'm sure Ant will forget that.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.200]   Yes.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.200]   He's got to go to terminal.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.200]   What was that?
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.200]   Linux admin?
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.400]   I got to go to terminal.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.120]   I don't want it to be fair.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.720]   He knows what he's doing, Ant.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.720]   That's how Linux --
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   At lunch.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.160]   At lunch.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.120]   I decided for no good reason to blow out my Linux install.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:49.000]   And in about half an hour installed, I completely knew it Linux on here.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.720]   And I was concerned because one of the things we've done before is set the default rate
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:58.640]   and pulse audio to 48,000.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.800]   48 kilohertz.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.960]   And I was a little concerned, but then I played a YouTube video for John and it was fine.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   So I don't know.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.760]   We're just going to have to go with the TikTok musical every time for the testing.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.760]   Apparently TikTok's.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.760]   What is that?
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.760]   It's TikTok.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.880]   Now I have to remember where it is.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.880]   I think it's in --
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.880]   Slash bin.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.880]   It's close.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.880]   Here it is.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.880]   It's in --
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:23.880]   Slash Etsy.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   Slash B.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.880]   Slash B.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   Slash B.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:31.600]   Slash Etsy.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.600]   Slash.
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.600]   There we go.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   And then --
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   Oops.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.120]   And then inside Etsy, pulse.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.120]   I need --
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.120]   No.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.120]   Is this a --
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.960]   No, I do this is a right click.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.960]   I'll do this right click.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.960]   And then nano.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.240]   It works every time.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   I have to --
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.240]   No, demon.comf.comf.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:55.960]   And then -- oh, I have to pseudo, wait a minute.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:58.200]   You didn't have to right hand in right, sir.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.480]   No, I don't have to -- I have to pseudo that.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.840]   I have to pseudo first.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.840]   Okay.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.960]   Control A.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   pseudo.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.960]   Okay.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.960]   And then here's my password.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.760]   That's being patient.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.760]   That was very easy.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.600]   We're going to go down here in the demon.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.440]   We're going to go down here and find the default bit right here.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.440]   You see?
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.080]   The alternate sample rate.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.000]   The default sample rate is 44.1, but I don't want that.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.920]   I want the default sample rate to be 48.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.920]   48k.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:33.920]   Okay.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.920]   You remember, right?
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.680]   See, you know this.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:37.680]   You know this.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.560]   You know it's easy.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.320]   And the thing is, if you expect --
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:53.640]   If you expect the operating system to do all that, you never really understand how
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.760]   computers work.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760]   I'm just saying.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.760]   Oh, gosh.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.760]   Save that.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.760]   Okay.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   Now I have to restart pulse.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760]   Sudo.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   Sudo.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760]   Sudo.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760]   Pulse.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.520]   I can't remember how to do that.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   Stop.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.120]   Let's see if that works.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.120]   No.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.120]   Pulse audio.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.120]   What is it?
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   Is it pulse audio?
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.120]   Don't worry.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.320]   I should have written a set alias to fix that.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   That's exactly right.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.120]   I don't remember the name of the demon.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.120]   Shoot.
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:24.120]   I'll never mind.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.400]   Can we all get a look at Mr. Jarvis's face during this right now?
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.400]   I see --
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.520]   You can't do this on a Chromebook.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.240]   You're not selling it.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.160]   I'm going to try to tell you.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.240]   I wanted to use signal on my Chromebook.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.600]   And to do that, I have to have Linux.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.000]   And of course, what happens, I go in.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.240]   I can't do it from my -- what are they called this week?
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.240]   Workplace account.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.200]   Oh, that's stupid workplace account.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:52.200]   Yep.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:59.920]   How do I restart the server is what I need to do?
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.920]   Let's see.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:05.920]   I've got the demon conf.
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.920]   [laughter]
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:14.320]   Usually by now, the chat room has helped me.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.360]   No, the chat room is saying.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.960]   I have a fun way.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.560]   No, we're not going to tell you the command, Leo.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.560]   Here it is, kill.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.560]   Kill and start.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:24.560]   Thank you, pulse out here.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.040]   That's where I start.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.040]   See, I can count on Keith 512.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.960]   Sudo pulse audio.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.880]   That's what it was.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   Audio.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.640]   -kill.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.640]   And then no demon process.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.640]   That's okay.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.640]   I'm going to start it.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.640]   Okay.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.640]   So good.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.640]   So you're starting it.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:45.640]   You had to put your tank.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:46.640]   Oh, I shouldn't have run it as root.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.640]   That's my problem.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.640]   There you go.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.640]   Right there.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640]   Oh boy.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.640]   That's a little bit of a kill.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.280]   Now it'll say, oh, I know that one.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.560]   Now I have to not pseudo pulse audio.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.560]   This is the best.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.560]   That's a bit of a start.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.080]   And now let's go back to Bridgerton.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.840]   Already in progress.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:13.120]   For help of you out there.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.120]   Holy cow.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:15.280]   Of course I closed that tab.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.280]   Let's do this.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.280]   Tweet.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.280]   Let's go back.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280]   Here we go.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.280]   I missed it.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.120]   No, I didn't fix it.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:31.600]   No, I probably should.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.760]   I probably should reboot.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.280]   I just might have to reboot.
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.960]   Shut up.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.120]   Hey, so Spotify spent how much money to get you.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.120]   Trying to change the subject.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.120]   Are we?
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.840]   I'm moving along to another rain story.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.840]   Yes.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.600]   I really didn't want to play that.
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.600]   Was it 200?
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.600]   100.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.600]   100.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.600]   100 million.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.600]   But that's speculation.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:55.600]   We don't know.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.160]   And Joe says, yeah, part of the deal was that Spotify could kill any of my earlier episodes
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.160]   they didn't like.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.760]   Well, turns out that's 42 shows and counting.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.400]   Spotify continues to remove Joe Rogan episodes.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.880]   They're only on Spotify.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.200]   So I hope you Joe Rogan fans downloaded that one with the Bullet Cough Bulletproof Coffee
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.200]   Founder.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.200]   That's one of them.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.080]   Apparently, he and Dave Asprey are tight.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.360]   Apparently, something about Dave Asprey and Bulletproof Coffee doesn't Spotify didn't
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.960]   like it.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.000]   It's because it's science.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.960]   I've spurred him by video note.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.960]   I like Dave.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.960]   I've known Dave.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:35.160]   He used to be in the cloud computing industry.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.000]   What is wrong with your screen, sir?
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.760]   I'm also in fixing the sound.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760]   Are you?
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.760]   It's fixing the sound.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760]   I said no.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.800]   Somehow screw up the video as well.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.800]   I don't know.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.040]   I don't know what's happening.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.680]   Was it was it X server?
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.160]   Yeah, I must have.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.200]   I must have killed my X server.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200]   We have a technical.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:00.200]   No, no, it looks OK now.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.200]   It looks OK now.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.200]   Screen.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.200]   It looks OK now.
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.200]   It was just you, John.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.520]   Look, see, on the bottom screen is OK.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.520]   It's just you, John.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.840]   You see you throwing me.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.680]   I'm looking at it right now on the bottom screen.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:11.680]   Looks fine.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:13.760]   Oh, well, anyway, it doesn't matter.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.760]   You don't have to.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.760]   It is not.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.200]   I don't think you should throw John into the bus.
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   It's OK.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.200]   Don't worry.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   Calm down.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.200]   You don't need to see this.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200]   This is all in your mind.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.120]   It's the theater of the mind.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   It's so great.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.120]   You will.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.120]   Awesome.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120]   It's an audio show.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.120]   Imagine if you.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:38.120]   But of course, his audio doesn't work, but never mind.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.120]   Imagine if you will.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.360]   Let's go to terminal again and fix this.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.360]   Come on.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.360]   Prove.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.360]   You can do it.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.360]   Let's see.
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:52.360]   Imagine if you will, you're in a studio with Joe Rogan sitting 10 feet away.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.000]   Lots of figurines in between.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.160]   You got Dave Asprey.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.920]   He's the founder of Bulletproof Coffee.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.920]   Stacy, what makes Bulletproof Coffee so delicious?
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.240]   You're supposed to mix a bunch of butter in it.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.720]   Butter makes it better.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.000]   Special butter, too.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   Grass-fed cow butter.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.320]   Yeah, ideally you'd have yak butter, but since that's not available.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.320]   I was going to say, or yak butter.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:18.720]   So, yeah, grass-fed cow butter.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.560]   Anyway, no one's, Spotify's saying why these three episodes have been removed.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:31.400]   Apparently, Asprey also backs a frequently controversial anti-aging and scientific theories,
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:36.120]   including the claim that Bulletproof Coffee is extremely healthy while other coffee brands
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.040]   are not.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.680]   He really pushes that thing that they're moldy.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.840]   Yeah, he's got this whole thing about the mold and the coffee beans.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:43.840]   Coffee mold.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.560]   Some crazy ideas.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.720]   He says he's going to live to 180, so we'll find out.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.720]   I will anyway, because I want to live to 190.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.200]   I was going to say, maybe my daughter will.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.560]   I'll tell her to keep an eye out.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.520]   Great, great granddaughter.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.520]   But I don't know why.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:02.640]   So, you know, I would have thought they would delete it because there's anti-Semitic sentiments
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.240]   or racist sentiment.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.160]   No, no, it's because the coffee.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:08.080]   They don't like the coffee.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.560]   Well, right now we're in a public health kind of crisis.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:17.960]   So maybe, I mean, we do see people clamping down on misinformation about Trulical.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.640]   They also killed seven episodes with David C. Mann, maybe because of his name, C. Mann.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.560]   I don't know.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:31.800]   They killed episode 276 featuring little Esther Al-Madrigal, Josh McDermott, Brenda Walsh,
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.720]   Felicia Michaels, and Brian Redban because the jokes got racy.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:36.720]   Okay.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:44.240]   I know, you know, Joe Rogan says it is Joe Rogan experience.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.240]   You know, if you're a hardcore Joe Rogan fan, this is going to piss you off to know it.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:53.240]   But if it were really just, I would be pissed off if I were Joe, I'd be pissed off.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:54.240]   But Joe got up.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.720]   He said, quote, there are a few episodes that didn't want, they didn't want on a platform.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.480]   And I was like, okay, I don't care.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.920]   I got out of her mill.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.200]   I mean, he's kind of playing a character, right?
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.200]   Right.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.680]   I mean, so he's probably, you know, I'm a fan of people.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.840]   But this is what people, I'll be honest, is what people were afraid of when Spotify
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:21.120]   started to eat the podcast world is that these big corporate, you know, agendas would
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:26.080]   have intrude on what has been up to now freewheeling and fun medium.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.400]   Well, you don't have to go take a hundred million dollar payday.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.640]   And I mean, if they're bad, they should be mad at Joe Rogan.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.560]   If he was, you know, right.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:38.360]   He did it to the sign to check, but nobody, you're right.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360]   He's a kid.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.160]   Nobody gets mad at, you know, back of the check.
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.160]   Right.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.160]   Where it matters.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:46.160]   Don't sign the front.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.960]   Then it comes out of your account.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.960]   Right.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:54.320]   I, you know, yeah, I'm not angry about this, but I could see why Joe Rogan fans might not
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.800]   be thrilled about this.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.440]   Zoom has a zero day.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.240]   Oh, it's all right.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   Okay.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.240]   Wait, I have a question.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.240]   Yes.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.200]   I read and this is the, I've always called it a zero day.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.480]   I read in the New Yorker a review of Nicole Perla Perla.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.480]   Per.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.200]   Her book about hacking, which is according to everyone.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   Very good.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200]   But they said it's pronounced O day.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.680]   Yeah, they're wrong.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.680]   Okay.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.680]   I wasn't going to take the New Yorkers word for it, but that I was like, I really didn't
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680]   say zero day.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   Never.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.680]   Oh, day.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:28.680]   Okay.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.680]   That is so helpful.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.680]   That's a little rascals, I think.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.680]   Was that buckwheat?
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.680]   Buckwheat.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:36.680]   Oh, actually, yeah.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:39.000]   It was Eddie Murphy playing buckwheat.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000]   Oh, tay.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   Yes.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.560]   I call him zero days.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.200]   Steve gives him calls him zero days.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.960]   Bruce snire calls him zero days.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.640]   I would use calls him zero days.
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.440]   I think there's zero days.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.600]   I think maybe this writer got some.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:55.600]   Oh, maybe a fact checker.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.080]   I think somebody was messing with it.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.280]   Yeah, the New Yorkers famous for fact checking.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   That's all.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   Well, maybe somebody.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.320]   She said specifically, oh, and by the way, this is pronounced O days.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.760]   Yeah, it was in very low.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.800]   It was like pronounced O days.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.800]   It was.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.800]   I heard it.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:11.800]   I heard it.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.800]   I heard it.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.800]   I heard it.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800]   I think she got punk.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.800]   Well, here, let's see.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:24.240]   And on the digital version, maybe they changed it.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.240]   Let's see.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240]   But in the print version, that's okay.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.920]   I was just like, this is almost as bad as me going to the terminal.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.920]   Let's just move on.
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   Almost.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.920]   Not quite.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:32.920]   There you go.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.920]   Zoom zero day discover.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:45.800]   But the good news is it was discovered and revealed at the Pwn to Own conference, which
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.440]   is a very well known hacking conference where people bring their exploits and hack stuff.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.280]   It was done remotely this year.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:58.280]   And the reason this is important is because the companies pay bug bounties so that when
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.600]   these so all year long people were trying to make a living doing this, you know, finding
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.240]   these exploits, save them up.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.120]   And they hope to win money.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.600]   The companies pay the money so that zoom in this case gets the bug and fixes it before
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.920]   anybody else knows about it.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:23.600]   In this case, $200,000 for the Dutch White Hat security specialists who discovered this.
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:24.840]   Now, I don't know.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.520]   Malwarebytes is calling it a zero day.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:32.240]   What a zero day traditionally means is a newly discovered exploit that's already being used
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.360]   in the wild by bad guys.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.080]   I don't know if there's evidence that this has been.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.920]   It's a remote code execution flaw in zoom that would allow you to get into a browser
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.920]   tab.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:47.120]   This works on zoom in Windows and Linux.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.840]   And I believe Mac as well.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.920]   No, just Windows and Mac.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.620]   Sorry.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.920]   Not clear whether iOS and Android are vulnerable and I've heard that the web version of zoom
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:57.920]   is not vulnerable.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.820]   Anyway, it's been patched already.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:06.800]   But what it would allow you to do is if if somebody's in a zoom call is get in there
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.840]   and execute a program and that's not good.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.340]   That's not good.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:15.580]   Here's the way I can't show you the zip.
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.220]   Oh, I can't show you the GIF.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:20.340]   Here's the GIF that was posted.
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:24.540]   It's pronounced by the way zero if just so you would know.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:28.520]   And I went back and looked at the article and put it in the chat because I was like,
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.240]   I swear I'm not crazy.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.240]   That's funny.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.140]   That's really funny.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.860]   No, I'm pretty sure it's a zero day.
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.560]   Thank you all.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560]   You were right.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.560]   You knew it.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.900]   Well, no, I just I was like, well, I always mispronounce things.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.060]   So it's possible.
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:46.500]   We call them Z days.
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:50.700]   And then meanwhile, of course, Tuesday yesterday was patch Tuesday for Microsoft.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:56.400]   A record is it every Tuesday patch day every second Tuesday of the month.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:02.780]   So once a month, patch Tuesday is a holiday among Windows users right now.
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:05.640]   Yeah, because you can't get finished.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.640]   Got finished.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.940]   Before we get off.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.620]   Yeah, lots of flaws.
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:18.420]   I think 114 flaws, not all of them critical, but enough that you know, this was one of
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:23.460]   the biggest patch Tuesdays in living memory.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:32.860]   And among them, oh my God, the NSA revealed and Microsoft fixed four new flaws in exchange
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:35.180]   server.
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:39.420]   This is in addition to the previously discovered and patched flaws in exchange server that
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:45.940]   did have zero days that were being widely exploited.
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:47.620]   In fact, so much so did I mention this already?
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:50.820]   The FBI's been going around and patching them.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:57.220]   So anyway, four new vulnerabilities in the exchange server.
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:58.720]   Wow.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.420]   Thank you, NSA though, your tax dollars at work, right?
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.540]   When they're not packing for their own benefit.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.620]   And patch and upgrade our own or our messed up stuff.
[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:16.780]   There will be no union at Alabama's Amazon, Amazon's Alabama, White Center's margin.
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:19.820]   So what do you think panel was?
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:25.860]   I mean, nor you is, was it intimidation on the part of Amazon, which is what some claimed
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:28.100]   or that people didn't really want a union?
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:33.900]   I think the South in Alabama is probably a hard place to get a union going is my lunch.
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.300]   So I can't vote.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.500]   Tally was, oh, I can't remember it.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.500]   But was, yeah, was.
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:42.420]   1700 versus 70% I think.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.580]   It was a huge amount.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:44.580]   Not enough.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:49.940]   Not enough that probably intimidation would have had much to do with it if you ask me.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:53.580]   I mean, but Amazon does pay $50 an hour minimum, right?
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:59.540]   Yeah, I know McDonald's average for managers is $12.
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.540]   Wow.
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:01.540]   Oh man.
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:03.980]   And so Amazon has a lot of problems.
[01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:07.700]   They could be a lot smarter company trying to be just a little bit nicer to their employees
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:08.700]   and people.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:09.700]   It wouldn't be that hard.
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:12.740]   It's not a good look to be so aggressively anti union.
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:14.300]   It's not a great.
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.780]   But it's a little robber.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:20.620]   But a little focus on Amazon being, you know, there's a lot worse companies.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:24.180]   Walmart says they're going to get to an average of $15, which means they're going to be people
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.100]   paid more than $15.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.100]   Right.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.100]   So it's once again, let's go after the tech company is the big bad.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:33.820]   But there's plenty of companies in this country that screw people.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:34.820]   Well, okay.
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:39.700]   Is federal legislation mandating $15 an hour?
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.900]   I think it's not just a function of pay.
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:46.980]   The way that Amazon, I mean, there have been egregious things like no air conditioning
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:48.180]   and some of their warehouses.
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:49.180]   Oh God.
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:52.180]   I agree.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.180]   Absolutely agree.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:55.620]   I mean, in the way they treat their workers, I mean, they may pay them $15 an hour, but you
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:58.140]   are tracked like a freaking lab.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:03.140]   You're not a stipulator on them.
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.140]   You're not sure you don't fund the work to fries.
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.140]   Amazon's not the only company doing that.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:07.140]   Doing that type of stuff too.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:08.140]   Right.
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:09.140]   Well, yeah.
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:11.500]   But that's why this was a good test.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:16.500]   Because I think it was actually interesting because Amazon is basically saying, yes, we're
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.700]   not going to treat you like a human, but we'll give you more money.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:22.700]   And apparently that's okay for some of these people.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.940]   And it's because they don't have great other options.
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:26.020]   And that makes sense.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:30.340]   Because capitalism, okay, I'm just saying so now.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:35.940]   None of you is their single, but would you use Facebook's video speed dating app?
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.460]   Oh, you don't hop in offers this like a networking function.
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:40.620]   And I would actually use it.
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.380]   I'd be like that is super efficient.
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.380]   We're networking interesting.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:50.740]   The single folks I know universally hate dating mostly because they're older than.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.740]   I was going to say, what's the age groups are?
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.940]   Well, here's what Facebook says.
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:58.500]   No speed dating with kind people.
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.500]   Okay.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:02.300]   But what if you don't want a data kind person?
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.980]   Do you ever think of that?
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:10.340]   No public profiles, no swiping, a little swipe at Tinder, no endless DMS also a swipe
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:14.260]   at Tinder, free to use.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.380]   And it's made by the company's NPE team.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:20.580]   That's their experimental apps team.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:25.540]   They call it, I love the name, sparked, spark up a relationship.
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:31.820]   So, Steve Gibson recently got married.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.740]   And I don't know if this is public.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:34.740]   It's public to say that.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:37.140]   I don't know if what I'm about to say is public, so I won't say it.
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:38.140]   Let's not talk about it.
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:39.140]   It's about dating.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.060]   It's about how horrible dating is.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:42.060]   It's an endless process.
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.860]   I can tell you dating is terrible.
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.860]   It's a puzzle to Steve.
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.860]   It's a puzzle to Steve.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:47.860]   Yes, that's great.
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:49.940]   Oh, and his wife is wonderful.
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.860]   We've at least and I have met her in Boston.
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:54.100]   We did an event for last pass.
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:55.100]   She's great.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:56.100]   She's perfect for Steve.
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.100]   They're a fun couple.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:01.260]   Steve is such a gentleman.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:03.780]   I did ask them after they got married.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:05.020]   I said, "You want to go in a cruise?"
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.020]   And they said, "No."
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:07.020]   So...
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:10.020]   Do you get like a group discount?
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:12.020]   Is that what I was asking?
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:13.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:17.820]   So the way these things work, if we do it, I've done, I did like 15 geek cruises.
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:19.820]   He did them in the day.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:23.540]   They were, and they're free for the speakers and then people pay to be, it's like a conference
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.540]   at sea.
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:25.540]   That's a workshop.
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:26.540]   Yeah, it's like a workshop.
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.300]   In fact, we went to Alaska on Holland America.
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.860]   I did a chess cruise.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:32.380]   Ooh, yeah, that was fun.
[01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:35.940]   Man, there are people now at the party.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:39.580]   Is there a Linux cruise we could go on?
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:43.820]   Oh, let me tell you, if we do one we're thinking about, we're not sure.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.620]   If we do one, I promise, I will have a session on terminal commands.
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:50.540]   Oh, just you're anybody.
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.540]   And I will have a Gutenberg drinking game.
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:55.780]   Oh, you'll get many, many more people.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.340]   Don't schedule at the same time as my Linux commands.
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:59.340]   Okay.
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:02.340]   Oh, arrow and tab key are your friend.
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:06.540]   Anyway, what was I saying?
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.340]   Dating, Facebook.
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:09.340]   Facebook anyway.
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:10.340]   For four minutes, be dating.
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:11.340]   Would we do it?
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:12.340]   That's it.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.340]   I think it's interesting.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.540]   Have you ever done, you know, they didn't have speed dating when you were still.
[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:16.940]   I was a child bride, so now.
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:22.380]   Yeah, when you were on the market, so to speak.
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.140]   What else?
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:26.140]   I need.
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.140]   What?
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:28.140]   Change log.
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:30.220]   Oh, God, I almost forgot.
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:31.220]   Thank you, Stacey.
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:38.060]   It's time for time for wait for it.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:45.940]   No, he was waiting for me to throw it.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.380]   But see, I don't like to say it's time for the Google change log.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:53.660]   And then somebody plays a thing that says the Google change log that's redundant, John.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:59.620]   So I'm going to just go from now on the ellipsis is your cue.
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:03.300]   When you hear it's time for dot dot dot.
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:05.060]   You'll put the ad in there.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:06.060]   What's gold?
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:15.340]   John, can you one day insert Higgs in space just for fun?
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.940]   If I weren't on Linux, I'd play that for you right now.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:26.420]   Google assistant can now find even ring silenced iPhones.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:31.780]   Wait a minute, this is a very confusing headline.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.540]   Explain that somebody's got to parse this headline.
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:41.020]   Google assistant can now find and ring silenced iPhones as duplex expands to online food orders.
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:42.020]   This makes no sense.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:47.020]   That's a bad headline.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.020]   That's an AI written headline.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:52.020]   There you go.
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:53.020]   Okay.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:55.020]   So it's two different features.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.020]   Okay.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:01.020]   You could say, Hey, you know who the lady with G O O G L E Internet.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:04.020]   Hey, you know who find or ring my phone.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.100]   You've always been able to do that with Android.
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:12.820]   But apparently now on Apple's platform, the assistant will place a phone call to your mobile
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:14.700]   number.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.940]   Apple of course is the one that owns the beep beep beep sound.
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:19.660]   I can make my phone do that from my watch.
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:23.900]   So it's probably easier if you have a, you know, a watch to beep your phone.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.740]   It's like a car door opening.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:26.740]   It does.
[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:30.020]   Well, it's because it's your kids inside, but this is a this is oh my God.
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:35.860]   I love my this is useful because it's a it's just the right frequency to to to echo locate
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.580]   if you're a bat.
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:40.260]   So you can know exactly when your phone is.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:45.180]   I got to tell you that is a sound that is a sound heard at least daily in the LaPorte
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:46.180]   household.
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:50.900]   I love I love asking my assistant to find my phone.
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.860]   I do it daily as well.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:59.140]   I updated that title to make it more SEO friendly for you.
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:01.780]   Tell us what it was the new title.
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:04.060]   Google assistant can now find slash ring silence.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:08.220]   I phones as do play suspense online food orders via blockchain.
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:10.620]   In five.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.940]   In five.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:12.940]   In five.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:15.780]   Profit on Verizon.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:21.660]   Actually, I think T mobile is better SEO than Verizon.
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:22.660]   I'm just saying.
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:29.300]   The you do have to enable it blah, blah, blah.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:35.500]   But it does work even if the phone is silenced and do not disturb is enabled, which is kind
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.500]   of nice.
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:38.860]   Actually, that's going to be with a Google home app.
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:40.980]   Then then you could do that one.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:42.340]   Duplex on the web.
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:47.340]   That's the duplex is that thing that was uncanny that they demonstrated to a two years ago,
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:54.140]   Google IO, where your phone you call a rest you say, Hey, you know, who call a restaurant
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:58.620]   and it'll make it a reservation for you can also do that now with takeout.
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:02.740]   My wife said that there was some story I forgot to get the link from her that the majority
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.740]   of the calls are still made by human beings.
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:05.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:07.180]   Yeah, I'm sure they are.
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:08.180]   It's yeah.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:10.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:11.180]   That's that's Google for you.
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.180]   That's a job.
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.180]   Googling that shell.
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:18.220]   Well, it also reminds me of that great sign filled episode, which Kramer was movie phone.
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:20.740]   I love that.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:22.660]   You're right.
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:23.660]   Now makes me laugh.
[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.060]   Just thinking about it.
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.060]   Hello.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:29.020]   This is movie phone.
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.660]   Please state your movie.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.500]   Meanwhile, duplex on the web can help with takeout.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:39.980]   You have to first of all, the restaurant has to appear in the Google app.
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:42.060]   You'll make menu selections in the Google app.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:46.860]   And then at the very end in the final checkout process, they'll be button to automatically
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:50.940]   navigate the site, fill out your contact or payment details.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.460]   Wow.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.220]   And synced Chrome auto fill.
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.140]   And a sheet will slide up.
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.980]   I'm just going to call the freaking restaurant.
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:04.740]   And a sheet will slide up to walk you through the process.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.340]   Oh my God.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.340]   It's very complicated.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.340]   This is for this is it?
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:10.180]   No, kids hate talking to people.
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:11.180]   That's true.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:12.180]   That's true.
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:13.180]   This is for people who hate to talk.
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:15.420]   My daughter will do anything to avoid this.
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:17.260]   Actually, I'm the same way.
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:18.260]   Oh, I love that.
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:20.340]   I think that's normal.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.020]   My daughter refuses to text.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.580]   She has to call and it's like, Abby, you're 28.
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:26.580]   You're supposed to be texting.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:27.580]   She's all right.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:30.460]   It hurts my thumbs.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:33.580]   I think it's probably because her phone's almost always the glass is almost always broken
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:35.580]   on the front, but that's another story.
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:38.140]   Don't you have a spare one you could load her?
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:40.860]   I give her new funds regularly, Jeff.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:44.220]   But only after her fingers start getting cut.
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.900]   She says, I need a new phone now.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:54.020]   Google is also making sunrise and sunset triggers in assistant routines available globally.
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:55.020]   Those are nice.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.020]   Okay.
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.220]   So like, for instance, your lights, I like my lights to dim.
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.940]   Yeah, Google was way late on the sunrise sunset.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:01.940]   So this is good.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:07.060]   Yeah, yeah, I did that with my hue lights five years ago.
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:10.060]   Android has a, this is this is April Fool's.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.060]   No, it's not.
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:12.060]   No, no, no.
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:13.540]   I put it in there.
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:21.940]   Android has a new feature to save you future embarrassment called heads up.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:26.620]   It will stop you from walking into telephone polls and other pedestrians.
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:28.180]   Oh my gosh.
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.180]   Really?
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:30.180]   Yes.
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:31.180]   Okay, I do that.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:34.460]   I do that not even when I'm not on my phone.
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:38.300]   I just do that because I'm looking at like, I have, I have classic.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:40.100]   It can't help you with that.
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:42.020]   You have to be like, it's only if you're looking at your phone.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:43.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:45.780]   So let's say this thing does not work.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:46.780]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:47.780]   Who's going to start selling Google?
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.780]   Are we going to see very careful?
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:53.220]   That's a little bit of an embarrassing suit, don't you think?
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:57.980]   I want to really this is America.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:01.140]   This is America, the home of the ridiculous litigation.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:02.140]   Come on.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:09.100]   I'll never forget when I was a kid, I got my drops in my eyes.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.860]   So I saw blurry and my.
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:11.860]   My sister.
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:12.860]   Yeah, dilation.
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:14.180]   So my sister was with me.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:15.620]   So she said, I'll walk you home.
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:19.620]   She probably walked me right to a telephone poll.
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:21.620]   Oh, siblings.
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:24.900]   It really hurt.
[01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:25.900]   Okay.
[01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:26.900]   Wow.
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:30.340]   I'll never forget it.
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:34.420]   Had I had this digital well-being feature, it still wouldn't help because all the fun
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:39.500]   days would have walked it is periodically reminds you to keep your head up when you're
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:40.500]   walking.
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:44.500]   Oh, I thought it would do something like, why can't you solely to be like a.
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:45.500]   It should.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:46.500]   There's a poll.
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:47.500]   It's a poll.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.500]   No, all it does is if it knows, if it notices, you're going to be able to get it.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:54.100]   This is you're both walking and using your phone, which is a bad behavior.
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.100]   Stop it.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:56.980]   It will then say, hey, just don't walk in.
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:58.580]   Left ahead.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:57:59.580]   Heads up.
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:04.500]   Well, equally bad as people who stop walking to use their phone when they're still.
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:05.500]   If you haven't.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:08.140]   Or just walk slowly while using their phone.
[01:58:08.140 --> 01:58:14.820]   If you haven't yet watched the seven new year episode, Fran Liebowitz series on Netflix
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:23.020]   pretend it's a city that is actually the source of that title, pretend it's a city.
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:26.020]   I'm walking and now everybody, people have stopped.
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:29.980]   They're looking at their phones, pretend it's a city.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:32.180]   People are going somewhere and doing something.
[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:33.700]   Have you seen this yet, Jeff?
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:34.700]   No, I haven't.
[01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:35.860]   Oh my God, it's hysterical.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:36.860]   You got it.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.580]   Scorsese made it.
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.780]   It's a Scorsese documentary with Fran Liebowitz.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:43.740]   She reminds me of like, Lewis Black.
[01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:44.740]   She is.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:46.900]   She said exactly that grumpy kind of.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:50.540]   She's grumpy, but she's right about everything.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.100]   Lewis Black reminds you of her.
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:53.260]   She's been around for a long time.
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:54.260]   That's probably.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.260]   Oh, sorry.
[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.980]   She's not quite as hyped up angry as Lewis Black.
[01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:00.860]   No, no, she's reasonably angry.
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:01.860]   She's perfectly perfectly perfectly.
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:02.860]   She reminds me of Jeff.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:04.860]   It's kind of like Jeff.
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:05.860]   Jeff, my mother.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.860]   I think that is a compliment actually.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:08.860]   All of these people.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:09.860]   I may not be as intended as one.
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:10.860]   I could see him.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.860]   I'm going to take it as one.
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:13.740]   I'm going to take the tourists in Manhattan.
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:15.180]   He's on his way to work.
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.300]   Pretend it's a city.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:19.220]   I'm walking here.
[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:25.740]   I will say when I worked, let's see, when I worked at Business Week, it was down in Times
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:26.740]   Square area.
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:30.860]   And every time I come out of the subway, I just be like, I hate you all.
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:34.660]   Did they have the Elmos and the Dusnuda?
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:35.660]   Yeah, this was 2000.
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.660]   I'm square.
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:37.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:42.860]   It's just the subway station that I had to take the subway station.
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:43.860]   That's nothing.
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:48.060]   That's the suburbs.
[01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:51.620]   I lived in Washington Square.
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:56.100]   I had to avoid back of the day Elmos every day.
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:57.660]   I had the dogs.
[01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:59.300]   The Elmos.
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:00.300]   You don't know where they're going.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:01.820]   Actually, you lived in Washington Square?
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:02.820]   I'm jealous.
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:03.820]   That's a cool.
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:04.820]   I love the village.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:05.820]   That is beautiful.
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.820]   That's a great place.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.820]   It was nice.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.820]   Oh, I'm so jealous.
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:09.820]   You do so again.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:10.820]   Oh, man.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:11.820]   I would, you know, if I could get least of it.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:12.820]   I used to.
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:13.820]   I would do that in a minute.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:14.820]   I love it.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:19.580]   Google is shutting down both iOS and Android shopping apps.
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:21.580]   Add another Google app to the graveyard.
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:24.860]   Which has also a little importance here.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:30.220]   Although the shopping will continue, Europe's first big antitrust effort against Google
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:31.220]   was shopping.
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:32.220]   Right.
[02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:35.860]   And I always made fun of it because Google's failed at shopping every time they tried it.
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:36.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:37.860]   This is proof positive.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:39.860]   You can go to shopping.google.com and say.
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:44.420]   Thanks, but yeah, the apps are the apps are bye bye.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:46.420]   Bye bye.
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:50.340]   So are as long as we're doing the Google graveyard, we might have a new we need a new bumper.
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:53.540]   The Google graveyard.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:56.140]   Google was shutting down play movies and TV.
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:01.220]   The app on Roku and LG Samsung and Vizio TVs in June.
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.580]   I don't get this.
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:04.540]   They were going to push you to YouTube instead.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:11.580]   I guess you could buy it on YouTube instead, but it's not the play movies and TVs are going
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:12.580]   away.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:13.580]   They're just not going to have an app for it.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:15.780]   Which kind of sucks, but it's bizarre.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:16.780]   It's bizarre.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:17.780]   I don't get it.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:19.020]   They're also killing feed burner.
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.020]   Are they?
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:21.020]   Oh, no, really?
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:22.020]   No, it is.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:23.020]   Hold on.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:24.020]   Hold on.
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:25.020]   Hold on.
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.020]   Don't quote me on that.
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.540]   Wait a few weeks ago, we joked that we couldn't believe fever.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.540]   We're still around a ruthless.
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:30.740]   I haven't found it yet.
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:31.740]   It's our fault.
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:32.740]   We're sorry, feed burner.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:36.500]   If it's status, because we let them know it doesn't exist.
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:37.500]   Here's what happens.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:38.500]   Google announced.
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:44.420]   Google said it's moving feed burner to new infrastructure, but it's also deprecating
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.740]   its email subscription service.
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:51.740]   Okay, so it's got one foot in the grave.
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:52.740]   Yeah.
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:53.740]   Okay.
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:55.540]   So there you go.
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:57.540]   There you go.
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:00.260]   Google, a company that kills things.
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:07.340]   The Google I/O announcement, of course, as always is the case, was a great puzzle, which
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:09.660]   you can still, I think you could still do.
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:10.660]   Oh, maybe not.
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:12.300]   Maybe they've taken it away.
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:13.540]   They had a link on Sunday.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:15.700]   It was really fun punch cards and all that stuff.
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:17.940]   I hope you did it.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:24.340]   Click the dot though, because now there's a breakout game.
[02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:26.340]   Oh, remember breakout?
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:27.340]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:28.340]   Yeah.
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.340]   This was a good game.
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:32.660]   You used to be able to play that on our TI-82 calculators.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:33.660]   Oh, I know.
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:37.180]   It's about the simplest game ever, which Google's demonstrating now.
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:39.260]   Oh, where's Mr. Wozniak?
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:40.260]   Donk.
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:43.660]   Yes, that's-- oh, boy, that's a memory.
[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:47.900]   And I'm impressed that you knew that.
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:52.980]   That's when Steve Wozniak finally realized Steve Jobs was not his friend.
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:58.580]   Steve Jobs was offered by Atari $5,000 to write a breakout game.
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:03.100]   He went to his-- he couldn't code, so he went to his friend Steve Wozniak to write it and
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.140]   told him, yes, Atari's going to pay us.
[02:03:05.140 --> 02:03:06.900]   I don't remember what it was, like $500.
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:07.900]   $700?
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:08.900]   $700?
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:09.900]   $700?
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:10.900]   And he kept the difference.
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:13.500]   Yeah, and everybody loves this company.
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:14.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:15.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:20.220]   Well, and it's funny, because Woz for a long time would never say anything about Steve Jobs,
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:21.220]   but then we found that out.
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:23.620]   It was like, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:25.540]   He didn't know for the longest.
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:29.540]   You son of a gun.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:32.100]   You're a genuinely nice person.
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:33.100]   That's a jazzy.
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:34.100]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:35.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:36.100]   He's a sweetheart.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:39.460]   He's still playing a breakout.
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:48.540]   Google Pay Spring Challenge offers you a $30 reward for using the new Google Pay app.
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:51.540]   Now, how much would you pay?
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:56.380]   And I got that email, and I'm like, what are they talking about?
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:04:00.100]   It's kind of complicated.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:04.620]   You got to get five stamps during the spring challenge to get $30 deposit into your Google
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:08.540]   Pay balance.
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:12.180]   In other words, to get these stamps, you have to do things like tap to pay at a business
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:14.940]   or send payments to a friend, that kind of stuff.
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:17.220]   Some actions can only earn stamps once a day.
[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:19.820]   Others can do it multiple times a day.
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:24.180]   You may also see a trivia pop-up from time to time as a chance to earn stamps.
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.260]   And of course, sharing invites to Google Pay can also--
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:29.220]   If you've got to pay people to use your app.
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:31.620]   That's pretty pathetic.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:36.020]   But if you want $30 in Google credit, that's a way to do it.
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.940]   Did you want those OSO orange pixel buds?
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:39.940]   No, nobody did.
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:41.500]   Wait a minute, why?
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:43.500]   No, nobody did.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.140]   They don't work.
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.860]   Yeah, hey, they don't work.
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:47.940]   Be, they're ugly.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:48.940]   So you know--
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:49.940]   They're not ugly now.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:50.940]   Hold on.
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:52.940]   You don't think that all clams in orange, maybe I'm--
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:53.940]   I did like the color.
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:55.380]   --not matches with my skin tone.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:59.060]   Yeah, it's orange, orange, Jeff.
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:03.660]   Or you could get the lime green ones for when you're not feeling too well.
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.220]   So they've been discontinued.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.900]   So I'm sorry if you wanted them.
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:11.060]   And then somebody sneakily deleted whatever was the next--
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:12.500]   It was the market change.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:13.500]   The next change--
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.500]   I'm actually--
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:16.140]   I'm actually sneakily promoted it before.
[02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:17.060]   It got deleted.
[02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:22.100]   So that's Google change lock.
[02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:23.900]   Oh, is that where it went to Jason--
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:25.900]   Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:27.940]   Project Chip was in there.
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:32.380]   He must have moved it from where I put it in the real section of the show.
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:33.380]   It works.
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:36.140]   But Jason was like, Stacy, your smart home love doesn't count.
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:36.660]   It's good.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.700]   It was already in there.
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:40.620]   Look at how he's making notes.
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:42.980]   You promoted it through a green box.
[02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:43.940]   It was a green box.
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:48.140]   So before the show, Jeff Jarvis was telling us
[02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:56.580]   that the world famous philosopher Stakums had tweeted a little takedown of world famous
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:01.740]   physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:03.580]   You want to share the story with us?
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:04.580]   No, you go ahead.
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:05.580]   All right.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:11.820]   I'll show you the original tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:17.940]   "The good thing," he said, "about science is that it's true whether or not you believe
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:20.540]   in it to which Stakum--"
[02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:22.580]   Yes, I'm talking Stakum.
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:25.780]   The frozen meat product sandwich.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:28.580]   "To which Stakum tweets--"
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:33.220]   The irony of Neil's tweet is that by framing science itself as true, he's influencing people
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:38.180]   to be more skeptical of it in the time of unprecedented misinformation.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:42.660]   Science is an ever-refining process to find truth, not a dogma.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:46.140]   No matter his intent, this message is not helpful.
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:47.140]   Okay.
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:48.140]   Wow.
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:49.140]   By the way--
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.420]   This is a biological Twitter, man.
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:52.420]   It pissed a biological Twitter.
[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:59.580]   Just to prove that Stakums is an actual frozen meat product sandwich, it didn't use punctuation
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:02.260]   or the caps key.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:06.700]   Well, it used a little punctuation, but not all of it.
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:07.700]   It's weird.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:09.500]   Sometimes there's a period, sometimes not, you decide.
[02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:11.260]   There's quotations there.
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:12.260]   Yeah, I know.
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:15.660]   I don't understand why they didn't bother with some stuff.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:18.900]   But not only are their quotes, they're smart quotes.
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:21.180]   They're actually smart quotes.
[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:22.500]   It's not even just your shift key.
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:25.820]   They got the "any quote" and the "outy quote."
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:31.020]   It's like, "I've interviewed Stakum, otherwise known as Nathan Alabak.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:34.340]   He's a very nice and very smart guy."
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:38.260]   He also then said, "Log off, bro, to Neil deGrasse Tyson."
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.660]   Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:42.020]   "Who is not as beloved as he used to be?
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:43.340]   Let's face him."
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:50.340]   Jaden C. responded, "Baste and epistemologically sound."
[02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:51.980]   And Jonathan said, "Thank you.
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:54.780]   The scientific method--" by the way, he doesn't use caps either.
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:58.980]   "The scientific method should never be afraid of challenger skepticism."
[02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:01.740]   And then Seamus Blackley says, "Keep rolling, my brother."
[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:05.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:09.660]   Meanwhile, more tweets, "Twin Sisters reunited at Reunited at 92
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:15.740]   after vaccinations toast first dinner out with scotch and water."
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:17.060]   Oh, no.
[02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:18.500]   Why did Twitter think that was relevant?
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:25.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:26.780]   By the way, by the way, I had this.
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:30.220]   So to me--
[02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:30.740]   To you.
[02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:31.780]   --just speaking for me.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:32.780]   Just speaking for Stakus.
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.060]   Proper cheese steak.
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:39.060]   Should have cheese and steak and grilled onions.
[02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:40.340]   No peppers.
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:41.100]   Wrong.
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:41.860]   No mushrooms.
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:42.860]   No mushrooms.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:43.460]   No.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.180]   You got to have the mushrooms and peppers.
[02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:46.500]   You gots to have the mushrooms.
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:47.300]   And you know what?
[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:49.740]   I'll go one further.
[02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:51.420]   One further?
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:52.620]   Little bit of ranch dressing.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:53.820]   Oh, no, that's definitely right.
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:54.820]   Oh, no, you're done.
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:55.820]   You're done.
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:56.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:57.740]   That's fucking controversial.
[02:08:57.740 --> 02:08:58.940]   Controversial, I know.
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:08:59.900]   It's a mistake from a holiday inn.
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:02.460]   We're going to get ranch dressing in a cheese steak.
[02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:04.260]   Oh, come on, Miss Stacy.
[02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:05.460]   That was what she's doing.
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:06.940]   It's delicious.
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:10.740]   So you are never making fun of my kachoei pepe again.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:11.980]   Never.
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:12.980]   You have revealed yourself.
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:13.540]   No, I never make fun of it.
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:15.060]   I just worry that you're going to die.
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:18.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:20.500]   I love kachoei pepe.
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:20.860]   OK.
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:23.340]   Just in moderation is what she's saying.
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:23.860]   Right.
[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:24.500]   So you're right.
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:27.620]   According to the stay at home chef.com,
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:30.700]   the Philly cheese steak, traditional Philly cheese
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:34.060]   steak is thinly sliced ribeye, cheese, onions,
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:36.460]   and a delicious hoe-ghee roll.
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:37.460]   Period.
[02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:38.460]   Period.
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:39.460]   Period.
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:40.460]   Full stop.
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:41.860]   Now you can add your own mustard.
[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:45.380]   Have you ever had a cheese steak from Pat or Genos?
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:46.380]   Do you know?
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:47.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:47.860]   Which do you prefer?
[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:49.500]   Are you a Pat's guy or a Genos guy?
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.140]   I forget.
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.300]   That's a fight.
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.500]   I'm a New Yorker.
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.980]   I don't care about Philly fights.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:55.700]   That's the--
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:59.020]   And of course, it has to be an amorosa roll,
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:01.940]   or you're not nothing.
[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:04.540]   I have had-- I can't remember if I-- which I had.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.340]   But when we were in Philly, I said we got to have--
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:08.340]   Yeah.
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.500]   We're at whatever was Pat's-- I think it was Pat's.
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:13.420]   We got to have a cheese steak.
[02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:14.900]   I love cheese steaks.
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:19.100]   But I confess, I might sometimes have peppers on my cheese steak.
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:20.060]   Not mushrooms.
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:22.060]   And definitely not ranch.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:22.900]   Unbelievable.
[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:23.900]   Unbelievable.
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:24.580]   No.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:25.580]   No.
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:31.500]   Any other stories we want to talk about?
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:33.020]   I'll tell you a story that's going to be driving you crazy.
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:37.700]   Coinbase, 102 B valuation.
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:41.420]   102 billion bitcoins.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:42.260]   Yeah.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.500]   No hat would be something.
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:45.580]   You buy the stock with Bitcoin.
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:47.300]   Did you put this in from the intelligence
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:49.740]   or confessions of an overnight millionaire?
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:52.500]   Yeah, it's kind of interesting because it's--
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:56.580]   as somebody said, it's a real white story.
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:57.420]   Now, we don't know who it is.
[02:10:57.420 --> 02:10:58.140]   It's anonymous.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:11:01.100]   But it's-- oh, I just happened to make $6 million.
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.180]   Oh, gosh.
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:04.060]   I don't know what I'll do with this.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.940]   And what my response was that it's the best justification I've
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:09.140]   seen for taxation, ever.
[02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:10.140]   So--
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:14.140]   Yeah, if it really scares you that you made a lot of money
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:18.300]   in your IPO, give it to the government.
[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:19.580]   It's OK.
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:22.620]   It's not wrong.
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:25.900]   They'll make good use of it.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.220]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:31.140]   I'm never going to read that article, ever.
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:32.140]   They just make--
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:33.140]   They just read it.
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:34.220]   They make me mad.
[02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:35.020]   That's our--
[02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.220]   Yeah, I'm really mad.
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:37.660]   I'm really rich.
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:41.060]   And it's just not as easy as you think it might be.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:42.540]   Screw you, buddy.
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:43.540]   Yeah.
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:46.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:47.660]   The heck with you?
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.100]   But that's how they get clicks.
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:53.340]   You could give it to me.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.340]   OK.
[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:55.700]   I'm just going to double his advocate here
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:58.100]   since I'm on a roll with my ranch.
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.100]   Do it.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:01.060]   It's notable.
[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:02.540]   There are notable issues with people
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:04.380]   who become wealthy overnight, like a lot of winners.
[02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:05.380]   Oh, I'm a lot of people.
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:07.580]   Oh, yeah, I recognize that.
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:09.820]   But don't go complaining about it.
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:10.780]   Well, I mean--
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:14.700]   By the way, Stacey--
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:15.620]   I think the flood pin floats.
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:18.180]   The chatroom has a question for you.
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:21.140]   If you like ranch, do you like, crunch?
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:22.580]   Oh, no, that just-- I looked that up,
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:25.580]   and that almost caused me to vomit into my mouth.
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:27.060]   That is awesome.
[02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.540]   It combines-- show this, John--
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:35.180]   the delicious taste of classic ketchup plus ranch.
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:37.060]   This is why there's a ketchup shortage,
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:38.380]   because they use it for that kind of--
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:40.100]   Cocktail sauce, basically.
[02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:43.180]   That is not-- cocktail sauce is horseradish and ketchup,
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:44.140]   but that is delicious.
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:45.060]   Oh, I love horseradish.
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.060]   Yeah, horseradish.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:47.060]   That's right.
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:47.580]   That's right.
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:49.020]   Oh, like, hold on now.
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.420]   So that's the opposite line of addressing.
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:52.420]   I do have--
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:54.580]   That's not the restate is the two of them plus relish.
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:55.100]   Yeah.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:59.620]   The thing about ranch is the ranch you buy in a bottle--
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:01.580]   Oh, no, there's this store-- there's this place here,
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:02.580]   this restaurant.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:02.580]   Yeah.
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:03.740]   It's called Hijkok.
[02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:05.940]   And they make their own ranch.
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:08.340]   Oh, and they actually sell it.
[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:09.260]   That's how good it is.
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:12.740]   Like, I will buy their ranch to put on my cheesesteaks.
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:14.900]   No.
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:16.540]   There's a guy I know.
[02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:20.780]   He's got this TikTok channel where he makes his own ranch
[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:24.820]   dressing and homemade and shows you how to make it.
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:25.820]   Garbage.
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:26.820]   I don't know why, but it always is.
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:27.820]   The restaurant rangers way better.
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:29.180]   So for this, it's equal parts manning.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:30.980]   Too bad his dad can't play the sound well.
[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:35.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:36.580]   Is he a sideline?
[02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:37.820]   That's what he sounds like.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:38.820]   What are you talking about?
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:41.020]   If dad still had his Chromebook, they'd be fine.
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:42.580]   What are you talking about?
[02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:44.660]   We're going to fit-- the editors will fix this in post.
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.300]   I haven't used canned artichoke hearts and dry them off
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:50.340]   and cut them with flour in a big bag for the batter.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.340]   Oh, wait.
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:53.300]   I think it's better if he sounds like that to me.
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:55.300]   That's what he did.
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.300]   Real season and dry cut.
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:00.020]   He made this is a TikTok.
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:03.100]   Fried pickles and artichoke hearts
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:04.700]   with homemade ranch dressing.
[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:05.620]   Oh, I love it.
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:07.700]   He also says, I'm proclaiming Hidden Valley Ranch
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:09.660]   as my number one TikTok enemy.
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:11.140]   And those are good to go.
[02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:11.900]   That's awesome.
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.500]   Like fried foods with ranch.
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.580]   Oh, look at that.
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:15.260]   That doesn't look good.
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:16.220]   Did he just eat that entire?
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:17.700]   He ate a fried pickle with ranch.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:18.980]   That's probably what gave him COVID.
[02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:21.380]   I don't know.
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:22.540]   I don't know.
[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:24.660]   So this takes us back to the story about--
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:27.100]   see, I think you actually love TikTok.
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.860]   Back up online--
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:31.220]   this will piss you off, because I used the line number--
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:32.740]   $279.
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:36.500]   Stacey, where should I look for that?
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:37.140]   Wait, what?
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:37.740]   Never mind.
[02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:38.420]   The TikTok?
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:40.060]   I just think it's better when you say it.
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.380]   Oh, the line number.
[02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:41.860]   I'm sorry.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:42.940]   I didn't pay attention to the line.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.340]   I just ignored them.
[02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:49.820]   Am I spending too much time on TikTok asks Vox?
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:52.060]   It's the world's most delightful and powerful.
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:54.940]   Dissociation machine.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:57.500]   So she argues here, Rebecca Jennings,
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:01.580]   that it is a wellness app in and of itself.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:04.580]   Because it distracts you and takes you away and has formed
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:07.260]   the light.
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:10.260]   It depends on your algorithm.
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.900]   All I know is if you scroll long enough on TikTok,
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:20.820]   they actually put up a TikTok that says, go to bed.
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:22.100]   And I keep hitting that.
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:25.540]   And I keep on scrolling.
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:26.540]   Just saying.
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:30.220]   If you-- to be a favorite, look up L'auphy, L-A-U-F-E-Y on TikTok.
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:33.220]   This young woman amazes me.
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:34.580]   By the way, in this article, I finally
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:36.900]   found out that you have to scroll for more than an hour
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:38.140]   to get that to happen.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:39.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:41.420]   L-A-U on TikTok?
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:42.140]   Yeah, on TikTok.
[02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:43.540]   L-A-U-F-E-Y.
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:47.540]   You're just doing that to give me a hard time on my sound,
[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:48.660]   because now I can't listen.
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:49.380]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:49.900]   I forgot.
[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:50.540]   Oh, Jesus.
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:53.580]   L-A-U-L-A-U-F-Y.
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:54.780]   L-A-U-F-E-Y.
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:56.300]   F-E-Y, OK.
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:57.660]   I think she's a college student.
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:15:59.420]   Her voice is like from 19.
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:00.900]   Oh, we'll never know, will we?
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:01.740]   Because Leo--
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:02.700]   No, no, because you know still.
[02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:04.740]   All right, let me just go on the command line real quick.
[02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:05.860]   You made me do it.
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:10.980]   Or Stacy's never going to eat.
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.540]   It's going to take Leo for hours.
[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:13.020]   All right, all right.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.660]   We're going to take a break.
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:18.940]   And while I edit my con files.
[02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:21.580]   And in a moment, we're going to have some pics.
[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:22.140]   What do you think?
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.780]   How about that?
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:25.900]   Pics of the week coming up.
[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:29.820]   Punder Joe and the chairman saying, no.
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:33.020]   What if one of us played the audio and you just
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:35.940]   don't get the video with it?
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:36.500]   I can fix it.
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:38.140]   Latency.
[02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:41.440]   Now you're questioning his geek, man,
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:42.860]   and I can fix this.
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:44.620]   I know, but you know what?
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:46.140]   I mean, people get hungry, y'all.
[02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:46.740]   No, no.
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.220]   In fact, he's not going to do it.
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:49.860]   It's time for the pics of the week.
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:51.660]   And let's kick it off with Stacy.
[02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:53.060]   Because this is not a democracy.
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:53.980]   You see, I tried.
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:56.980]   I will tell you, Jeff, that she does have a lovely voice.
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:58.340]   Oh, all right.
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:16:58.820]   I'll play it.
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:16:59.260]   It's like a cruder.
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:00.140]   I'll play it later.
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:01.340]   I just have to do some editing.
[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:02.340]   Yeah.
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:03.860 --> 02:17:05.860]   Ah.
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.220]   OK, go ahead, Stacy.
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:08.060]   You're pick of the week.
[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:08.580]   Your thing.
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:12.860]   You showed us before the show some sort of boxy thing.
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:13.500]   Wait, what?
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:13.980]   You.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:15.540]   Pick of the week time.
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:16.740]   Well, no, I know that.
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:18.020]   I'm just like a boxy thing.
[02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:18.700]   Well, what was it?
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:19.020]   Oh, no.
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:19.900]   You showed us the stickers.
[02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:20.260]   That's right.
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:20.620]   Never mind.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:21.420]   Oh, I was like--
[02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:21.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:22.420]   That's what it was.
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:25.940]   No, this week-- I gave you a choice between a thing or a book.
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:26.300]   So--
[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:27.340]   Yes, that's what it was.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:27.780]   I'm sorry.
[02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.260]   My memory's going.
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:29.820]   That's OK.
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:30.740]   You had a COVID shot.
[02:17:30.740 --> 02:17:31.220]   I had the COVID shot.
[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:32.220]   That's going to make you feel funny.
[02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:34.380]   Yeah, I feel funny.
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:36.220]   I'm giving y'all a book of the week.
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.060]   It's actually a book, an audio book combined.
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:41.980]   I love a woman named Amber Ruffin.
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:44.620]   She cracks me up.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:45.860]   I think she is delightful.
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:47.860]   I want to be your best friend.
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:50.220]   This has nothing to do with tech.
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:53.100]   And she has a book out.
[02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:57.660]   And I'm going to tell you the actual name of it somewhere.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:00.300]   She's just got a new show, too, not too long ago.
[02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:01.420]   I know.
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:03.420]   OK, you'll never believe what happened to Lacey.
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:05.500]   Crazy Story is about racism.
[02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:08.260]   And she is-- yeah, she's a comedian.
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.100]   She's on Seth Meyers show.
[02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:13.820]   She has a segment called Amber Says What.
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:14.780]   Just Google it.
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:15.860]   You'll crack up.
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:16.300]   Or not.
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:17.580]   Maybe you won't.
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:22.340]   And the book is basically her and her sister Lacey, who
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:24.580]   lives in Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:28.940]   Lacey experiences racism all the time.
[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:31.980]   And some of these stories in Amber
[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:34.980]   because she's a comedian, it's funny.
[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:38.580]   But it's also freaking tragic.
[02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:41.100]   Just hearing this, it is a constant drip-drap.
[02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:44.140]   So if you're a person who is like,
[02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:46.540]   I make fun of microaggressions because I know lots of people
[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:48.500]   who are like, I don't understand this.
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:52.900]   Just do us all a favor and just read the book or listen to it.
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:53.900]   I have it on Aonio tape.
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:57.060]   It's funny, but there are also images in the book.
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:01.500]   So if you want the book, do that.
[02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:02.780]   Where is the podcast?
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:04.940]   Because I'd love to take a listen to that.
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:06.420]   Do you know what the name of anybody else?
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:07.540]   No, it's not a podcast.
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.660]   It's a show on Peacock.
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:11.020]   Oh, it's a show on Peacock.
[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:11.940]   It's a late night show.
[02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:14.340]   But if you go to YouTube, you can see her--
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.740]   I mean, you can submit from her show.
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:18.060]   Amber Ruffin.
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:20.660]   Are you FFI?
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:22.460]   I got it.
[02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:25.060]   Amber says, what?
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:26.860]   That's her thing on Seth Meier's show,
[02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:29.700]   and then she has her own show on Peacock.
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:33.900]   How about Texas just don't give a hoot?
[02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:36.780]   We lifted the mask mandate and allowed businesses
[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:40.020]   to reopen at 100% capacity.
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:42.580]   You might ask, why would they do such a thing when--
[02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:44.180]   Scientists are against it.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:46.300]   When doctors and nurses are begging us--
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:47.220]   I think we're going to have to be--
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:48.300]   To hold on just a little bit longer.
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:48.860]   --a little bit longer.
[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:49.820]   Simple.
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:51.660]   Because Texas rocks!
[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:53.660]   [LAUGHTER]

[02:19:57.660 --> 02:20:20.880]   So would you as a former resident of Texas
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.860]   endorse this philosophy?
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:23.860]   I would.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:24.360]   Yes.
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:26.060]   No, I endorse for making fun of it.
[02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:26.560]   Yes.
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:27.060]   Yeah.
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:28.260]   Amber Ruffin, that's awesome.
[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:28.760]   That's awesome.
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:29.820]   You suck it up.
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:31.340]   That's awesome.
[02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:32.340]   Yeah.
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:33.440]   Who is the TikTok?
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.560]   Because I want to try that again.

[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.660]   L-A-U.

[02:20:50.980 --> 02:20:51.460]   Google.
[02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:53.620]   Use the thing called Google.
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:54.620]   Google.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:55.620]   TikTok.

[02:20:58.040 --> 02:20:59.560]   Pronounced L-A-V-A.
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:00.240]   So go down.
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.400]   No, fine.
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.400]   So go down.

[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.360]   Or that one where your cursor is that one for you?
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:10.000]   This one, it's really kind of sad.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.360]   I love my Monday moments.

[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:15.840]   One more thing I have to do.
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.840]   I did fix it, but I've got to--
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:19.120]   Oh, no, it is coming out.
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:20.080]   That's what it sounds like.
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:20.440]   OK.

[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:31.140]   I go to the symphony.
[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:31.940]   Sit along.
[02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:33.500]   So you go through TikTok and you get the--

[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:37.900]   That's enough.
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:38.400]   Stop.
[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:38.900]   That's enough.

[02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:03.260]   Summarizing it, it's in tech dirt.
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:04.540]   They were nice enough to run it.
[02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:08.540]   So you go to tech dirt and see her piece on how Donald Trump caused the tech lash.
[02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:10.940]   But that's not my number.
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:15.260]   Nor is it that 11 store-- one out of 11 stores are expected to close in the next five years.
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:16.260]   Oh, wow.

[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:53.780]   Is there a link?
[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:54.780]   Is there a link?
[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:56.780]   There's more like 46, Mr. Jarvis.
[02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:58.780]   There's more like 46.
[02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:00.780]   There are-- how many states?
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:01.780]   Yeah, what?
[02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:02.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:03.780]   What?
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:04.780]   What's--
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:05.780]   What's the number one's?
[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:07.780]   This is from youGov.
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:08.780]   Oh, well, your beat is smart.
[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:10.780]   You'll be as smart as you, Aunt Yaw.
[02:23:10.780 --> 02:23:18.180]   YouGov.com based-- the rest respondents, we don't know who, were asked to choose the better
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:19.780]   of two states from a list of 50.
[02:23:19.780 --> 02:23:22.180]   Oh, it was like a head-to-head matchup.
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:23.180]   Yeah.
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:27.820]   And Washington, you see-- okay, Hawaii number one, then Colorado, Virginia, Nevada, North
[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:28.820]   Carolina.
[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:33.180]   That's where you're from, Aunt Bruton, North Kackalagi, North Kack.
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:35.180]   Florida, Arizona, New York.
[02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:36.180]   Florida's--
[02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:38.180]   Florida's Florida filled with Florida, man's--
[02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:40.180]   Florida's a quite a nice state.
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:41.180]   It's a nice state.
[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:43.180]   I like Florida.
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:46.180]   Georgia, Texas, Maine, California--
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:52.180]   And then way down on the other side, the worst place in the world, Washington, D.C., then
[02:23:52.180 --> 02:23:57.900]   Alabama, Mississippi, and 48, New Jersey.
[02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:01.180]   New Jersey's worse than 47 other states, Jeff.
[02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:02.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:05.180]   What the Jersey has to say to you.
[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:08.020]   Rhode Island's smack dab in the middle, number 25.
[02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:09.940]   That's where I grew up.
[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:14.140]   South Kackalagi, strangely, is much lower than North Kackalagi.
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:16.060]   Why would that be, Aunt?
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:18.060]   They're born in South Kackalagi, you wanted to say it.
[02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:20.500]   Yeah, and they are definitely two different states.
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:21.500]   I can't attest to it.
[02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:22.500]   That's why you moved north.
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:23.500]   Different states.
[02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:25.500]   Yeah, not really.
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:26.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:31.980]   They're one and the same, but they're definitely two different states.
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:32.980]   Two different states.
[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:33.980]   All right.
[02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:36.900]   What are you-- I'm sorry, TikTok keeps playing.
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:37.900]   I'm trying to stop it.
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:42.460]   Well, now that you finally got this working, I can't stop playing TikTok.
[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:48.340]   I'm actually trying to find my favorite TikTok singer who is an Israeli woman, who has an
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:52.380]   amazing voice, and I don't remember her handle, unfortunately.
[02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:54.340]   So I'll see if I can find her.
[02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:56.620]   Go ahead, Aunt, with your pick of the week.
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:59.860]   Oh, I got a couple.
[02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:06.100]   The first one is-- as I wrote on the line there, I'm not against guns, but Pat Barnes
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:09.340]   sums it up quite nicely.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:14.620]   Pat Barnes is a cartoonist, illustrator, if you go to that link, KGOL.com.
[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:18.860]   It's a pretty topical image that he's got there.
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:25.300]   But you say you are not against guns, so why would you promote this anti-gun cartoon?
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:31.620]   Well, because of the context of what's recently happened, I believe it's this past Sunday with
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:32.620]   guns here, right?
[02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:33.620]   It's not that you're against guns.
[02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:38.820]   It's your against people getting shot by guns, which I am against as well.
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:45.900]   And the police officer, in quotes, accidentally shot Dante Wright because he thought he was
[02:25:45.900 --> 02:25:48.940]   getting his taser and he killed him.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.860]   She has since she was killed.
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:54.020]   In fact, if you watch the video, she goes, "Oh my God, I shot him."
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:58.060]   She clearly didn't expect it to have a bullet in it.
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:03.380]   They've since resigned, and I believe there is now charges of second degree manslaughter.
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:05.580]   That's such a sad story.
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:08.900]   And so close, of course, to where George Floyd was murdered.
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:09.900]   Right.
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:14.340]   That trial was going on at the same time when this happened.
[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:21.780]   But the cartoon shows an officer angry with his gun pulled on, of course, a black driver
[02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:24.940]   with a little pine tree air freshener.
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:29.460]   The officer is saying, "I'm worried that air freshener might be obstructing your visibility."
[02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:35.180]   Meanwhile, a guy with four guns in his rack, trying to pick up drives on by.
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:39.860]   And being from Southcack in Northcack, I saw that image.
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:46.180]   Oh, the nose of gun racks is just a normal kind of thing to see there.
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:51.700]   But to be fair, gun racks don't usually obstruct your visibility.
[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.420]   They don't obstruct your front forward.
[02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:55.420]   That's true.
[02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:57.020]   You can't look over your shoulder.
[02:26:57.020 --> 02:27:00.180]   Your rear view mirror is kind of occluded by guns.
[02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:01.180]   Exactly.
[02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:03.180]   That's how I like it.
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:04.180]   Sorry.
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:11.060]   But now I'm not against guns because I remember having a nice heated discussion with a bunch
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:16.020]   of the people in the Twitterverse about taking my kids, the hard hits, to a gun range back
[02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:18.580]   when they were really, really young.
[02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:20.180]   People will call them me a horrible parent.
[02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:21.180]   No.
[02:27:21.180 --> 02:27:22.180]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:23.180]   That's exactly what you should do.
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:24.180]   Teach them that right.
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:27.580]   I wanted them to see the power of a firearm.
[02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:28.900]   Take it seriously.
[02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:29.900]   To respect it.
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:30.900]   Exactly.
[02:27:30.900 --> 02:27:36.340]   I wanted it and the whole family had a good time, but they learn, you know, this is real
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:37.340]   stuff.
[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:40.180]   This isn't Call of Duty, you know, and hit spots and whatnot.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:42.740]   I did the same thing with Henry.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:46.100]   We went to a rifle range with 22s.
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:48.620]   They weren't, you know, big old guns.
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:54.500]   But we had a South African drill instructor who was great.
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:58.300]   Because if you pointed your gun anywhere, but we're supposed to be pointed.
[02:27:58.300 --> 02:28:00.300]   Just go down range only.
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:02.300]   You wouldn't hear about it.
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:03.300]   That's right.
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:04.300]   That's fabulous.
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:05.300]   Fabulous.
[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:06.300]   Forte former South African commando.
[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:08.780]   So you can, you could tell how scary he was.
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:12.500]   My kids will never ever forget that and they still talk about that.
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:13.500]   Yeah.
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:14.500]   Good.
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:15.500]   Good.
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:16.500]   So I did something right there at least.
[02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:17.500]   Yeah.
[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:22.620]   But yeah, I, with all of that said, I put, I also put in there that peaceful and hopeful.
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:28.260]   And it's just an image from the peaceful protests from last year because seeing the image from
[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:34.180]   the, Mr. Barnes just made me think about the protests that the family and I, we all attended
[02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:35.180]   last year.
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:36.180]   Oh, there you are.
[02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:37.180]   Just got peaceful.
[02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:38.180]   There you are.
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:39.180]   That's the hard head.
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:43.460]   One of the hard heads to your left and that's in the middle with the back bracket.
[02:28:43.460 --> 02:28:49.140]   And so we just, I remember the experience in that and just, we were all warm on the
[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:54.380]   inside because we never assumed it would be such a peaceful, it's beautiful, isn't it?
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:55.380]   Yeah.
[02:28:55.380 --> 02:29:00.900]   And their knees, their hands up in many cases had a police head, scored in everything.
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:02.740]   It was just, it was great.
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:05.100]   Welcome to Northern California.
[02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:06.100]   It was great.
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:09.900]   I remember your sign said no piece KNOWP.
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:10.900]   Right.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:11.900]   KNOWP.
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:12.900]   Justice.
[02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:13.900]   Justice.
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:14.900]   Yeah.
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:15.900]   That's right.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:16.900]   Yeah.
[02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:17.900]   No justice.
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:18.900]   No peace.
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:19.900]   And lastly, this is for you, Mr. Jarvis.
[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:24.380]   The reason I recently fired up TikTok.
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:26.740]   I don't know if that was, because we got the bug.
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:27.740]   You like musicals.
[02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:28.740]   I know.
[02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:31.020]   The real house plants of Sonoma County.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:32.020]   Wait a minute.
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:33.020]   Wait a minute.
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:35.020]   I got to listen to this.
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:38.020]   Oh my gosh.
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:40.340]   Are these, is this, that is Queen Pruitt.
[02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:41.900]   I was going to say, is this Queen?
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:42.900]   Yeah.
[02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:43.900]   Does she make these?
[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:44.900]   Where does she get these?
[02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:45.900]   These are great.
[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:47.980]   She's been hand painting those.
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:48.980]   She makes them.
[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:49.980]   Yeah.
[02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:50.980]   Oh my God.
[02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:51.980]   They're beautiful.
[02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:52.980]   Great.
[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:54.540]   They're launching a TikTok page.
[02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:56.660]   I want the follow way.
[02:29:56.660 --> 02:29:57.660]   She's got a customer.
[02:29:57.660 --> 02:30:01.500]   Lisa and I love when they try to boost your signal.
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.700]   And of course now I'm going to take a look.
[02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:04.700]   Did she sell them?
[02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:05.700]   And I absolutely hate it.
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:06.700]   Oh, they're there.
[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:07.700]   They are beautiful.
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:08.700]   Yeah, she's got in a couple orders this week.
[02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:09.700]   So she's PHEBS.
[02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:10.700]   Right now.
[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:11.700]   FEEBS.
[02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:12.700]   JP14.
[02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:13.700]   Let's see.
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:14.700]   Let's repeat that again.
[02:30:14.700 --> 02:30:15.700]   So people got it.
[02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:16.700]   FEEBS.
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.700]   PHEBS.
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:18.700]   JP14.
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:27.540]   And I love the real housewives of Beverly Hills music to go along with it.
[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:28.540]   That's cool.
[02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:29.540]   She's been working pretty hard on that.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:31.620]   It's been part of her.
[02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:33.780]   I guess you can say mental piece.
[02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:37.020]   Yeah, that was your video all about it.
[02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:42.260]   When I watched it, I was like, that's why he was so excited about the cheap grow light.
[02:30:42.260 --> 02:30:43.260]   Yeah.
[02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:44.260]   You got it.
[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:51.260]   You know, but this is clearly, I love this because it's clearly art therapeutic.
[02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:52.260]   But it's also therapeutic.
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:54.260]   Yeah, painting like this.
[02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:55.260]   Yeah.
[02:30:55.260 --> 02:31:02.940]   Where does she get the pots?
[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:05.100]   I want those pots are hysterical.
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:07.260]   Yeah, she's ordering them from wherever.
[02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:10.500]   I'm not sure where she's getting them from, but she's dripping down and she's got all
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:12.020]   of these paints everywhere.
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:13.020]   I'm fine.
[02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:15.460]   Well, Phoebe is a very talented nail artist.
[02:31:15.460 --> 02:31:17.100]   She's done my nails.
[02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:20.540]   She has already the fine hand and the line and all that stuff.
[02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:25.100]   Yeah, I told her I gave her some credit on that because I can't do that.
[02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:30.700]   But talking about TikTok, I never liked it because when I go to it, this is the first
[02:31:30.700 --> 02:31:34.740]   stuff I see is that and then whatever this is.
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:38.140]   A lot of women and bikini dancing and that bothers me too.
[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:39.140]   I kind of agree with that.
[02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:43.580]   It goes from that and then it goes from all of the racism stuff.
[02:31:43.580 --> 02:31:45.300]   It's just not a greatest.
[02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:47.620]   You're getting racist stuff, aren't you?
[02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:52.300]   People arguing against racism and people going back and forth about racism.
[02:31:52.300 --> 02:31:53.700]   I don't see any of this as racist.
[02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:55.420]   One person saying that's not racist.
[02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:56.420]   And I keep scrolling.
[02:31:56.420 --> 02:31:58.020]   I don't remember when I set it up.
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:00.260]   I said that my interests are photography.
[02:32:00.260 --> 02:32:02.180]   That's all that I tapped.
[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:03.660]   And I get all the blame.
[02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:06.580]   How the hell does that happen?
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:13.220]   I created my account and I put in some old videos that I've done just to try to see if
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:18.740]   it helped a signal and not so much because that's still some stuff that I've done previously.
[02:32:18.740 --> 02:32:19.740]   No, that's not good.
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:21.060]   And it just ain't working.
[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:25.860]   No, I only jumped on there because of her just to try to help boost her signal.
[02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:29.540]   Because she's proud of her and she's doing her thing.
[02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:30.540]   Yeah.
[02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:31.540]   Good for you.
[02:32:31.540 --> 02:32:32.780]   Good for you, Phoebe.
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:34.420]   We love those.
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.860]   I will buy some.
[02:32:35.860 --> 02:32:37.980]   I will buy some.
[02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:38.980]   Just yeah.
[02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:41.140]   That will definitely excite her.
[02:32:41.140 --> 02:32:42.660]   Yeah.
[02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:43.660]   That's really cool.
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:44.660]   Oh, here's the...
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:48.100]   Okay, I'll play one more since now I can get it working.
[02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:53.780]   This is who you should follow, Jeff, if you like singing on TikTok.
[02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:57.860]   Her name is Lael Barzi or Barzed.
[02:32:57.860 --> 02:32:59.460]   And she's just sings acapella.
[02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:02.820]   And I think she's a very beautiful singer.
[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:07.820]   ♪ Work you in the eye ♪
[02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:09.820]   Don't see the hook.

[02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:27.260]   But most of her stuff is acapella and she's kind of incredible.
[02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:29.260]   I don't think she's a professional.

[02:33:38.780 --> 02:33:40.260]   I'm a big girl, so it's perhaps.
[02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:41.260]   Yeah.

[02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:25.500]   He just keeps making candy.
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:28.500]   Oh, stop, stop, stop.
[02:34:28.500 --> 02:34:31.020]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

[02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:50.940]   Thank you, Mr. J. Buzzmachine.com for his blog.
[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:53.740]   So you're not going to tell us what this announcement is.
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:55.660]   You teased everybody for it.
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:57.980]   It's going to be Sunday, I'll tell you.
[02:34:57.980 --> 02:34:58.980]   Mm.
[02:34:58.980 --> 02:34:59.980]   Sunday.
[02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:03.620]   So so so Twit gets the announcement instead of Twit.
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:09.780]   The reason I was going to look, there's technical things we've got to figure out and solve.
[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:11.100]   They've been some delays.
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:16.340]   And I don't want to launch it until it's really ready to ready to go.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:17.780]   All right.
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:20.340]   So it's my new TikTok.
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:21.340]   Sing along channel.
[02:35:21.340 --> 02:35:22.340]   Don't.

[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:24.740]   Not supposed to say it yet.
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:25.740]   Oh, really?
[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:28.020]   I don't want to miss it's Twit the musical.
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:29.020]   Twit the musical.
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:32.740]   And Pruitt starring and Pruitt.

[02:35:40.460 --> 02:35:41.460]   I saw you this morning.

[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:49.140]   I gave you a long distance fist bump like that.
[02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:50.140]   That's right.
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:51.140]   Like that.
