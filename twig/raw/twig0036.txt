[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.800]   It's time for Twig, this week in Topeka.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.280]   I'm Leo LaPorte, and joining us right now for our topics
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.800]   of the week.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.840]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you for the obligatory chuckle.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.440]   I like that.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.480]   I like that.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.800]   Buzzmachine.com, the author of "What Would Topeka Do?"
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.960]   See, wouldn't it be good?
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.240]   Oh, look, now available on the iPad via the Kindle store.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.200]   Have you looked to see if the iBook store has it?
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.360]   No, it's a reader on Twitter told me it's not.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.040]   And that says because I thought Harper Collins,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.640]   my publisher had done a deal with them.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.800]   I'm not Twitter already.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.280]   Hmm.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.600]   We want to be everywhere.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.800]   Well, we'll push them to do that.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.680]   Also joining us, as usual, the great, the wonderful,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.160]   the lovely, and talented Gina Trapati.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.120]   The jealous Gina Trapati.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.920]   Well, I don't know.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.720]   Gina's got making a political stand.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.520]   And as with most political stands, it's painful.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.000]   I am without an iPad.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.320]   It's for a few different reasons.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.440]   But yes, I am without an iPad.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.520]   And I am sad about it.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.680]   I'm sad, Panda, today.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.880]   So I'll just ask questions.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.440]   I'll switch my user agent and look at websites in my browser
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   as it is here on the iPad and weep.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.000]   Also joining us this week from metafilter.com, the great Matt
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Howie.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.520]   Hello.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.240]   Good to have you back, Matt.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.840]   Who's that?
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.600]   Who's shirt is that behind you there?
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.120]   As a bike jersey from a famous bike race officer.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.360]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.320]   So you're a famous biker.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   Not mine.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   Matt does have an iPad.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560]   Two out of three, right?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680]   And there's the Kindle app.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   So this is--
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960]   They gave me this cool clock.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.800]   Have you seen this?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   What?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Who they?
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.680]   Oh, it's good.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   It's good bling.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   Hang that around your neck.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680]   Check this out.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440]   Yo, yo, yo.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.200]   Oh, man.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.800]   Rockin'.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.400]   You know how long is it before rappers start wearing their
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   iPads around their neck, really?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   Let's be honest.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.560]   Can only be a little distance.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.640]   So this, as you probably gathered, if you just tuned in, is
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.960]   iPad Day, the day the iPad emerged.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.640]   And Gina's the only one of us who doesn't have one.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.200]   That'd be an Android pad.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   There will be an Android pad.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Indeed.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, there already are Android pads.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.040]   TechCrunch had a list of iPad alternatives today.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.480]   Anybody get a juju yet?
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.200]   Speaking of TechCrunch, the old Crunchpad renamed.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   Apparently, they only sold 90 and had 15 returns or
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   cancellations.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.040]   So it's not-- I tried to buy it.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   I did try to buy it.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   I thought, I'll be fair.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   I'll get a juju and I'll have it side by side.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.920]   And their website was so poorly designed, I couldn't--
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.360]   I actually couldn't buy it.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.280]   Cash in hand, and I couldn't buy it.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   So maybe--
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.600]   The seven iPad alternatives.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.640]   One, it looks really interesting, is a German one that
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.360]   we're going to have very soon called--
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.080]   Come on, scroll, scroll, scroll, the Wepad.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.040]   W-E?
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.520]   Yeah, or I guess they would say over there.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.720]   The V-Pods?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.160]   V-Pods?
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.640]   Yeah, off your house.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.800]   Webcam, two USB ports, App Store and Android marketplace,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.440]   of course, multitasking.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.680]   Works with all the e-book formats, larger screen, flash
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.560]   support, disadvantages, sex tech crunch, none that we can see.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.480]   Now, I'm guessing TechCrunch doesn't mention the juju.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.520]   No.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   No, even though probably that's the most best known.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.840]   I think there's going to be some good Android choices.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.480]   Part of the thing about the iPad for me or a tablet in general
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.280]   is I never find myself going, wow, I really
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.320]   wish I had a tablet.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.040]   Like, I've got a netbook and I've got a laptop
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.400]   and I've got the Kindle.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.880]   And part of me not getting an iPad was less political.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.720]   I'm more just like, I have so many gadgets.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   I'm not necessarily impressed with the iPhone operating
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.920]   system and that whole thing.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.440]   But I just don't know where it would fit into my life.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.200]   I absolutely agree, Gene, and that's where I was.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.840]   But until my dean in my school said, you have to have one.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.760]   He wouldn't pay for it, but I use that as an excuse.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.640]   But the fascinating thing for me was how Walt Mossberg this week
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.480]   viewed it and so did to some extent,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.240]   Errington viewed it as a possible alternative to a laptop.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.920]   For me, it isn't possible to imagine
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.400]   because I do so much typing and writing.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.000]   But if you're a salesperson, if you're
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   going to conventions and stuff, maybe.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.400]   And that's what surprises me here.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   Leo, do you think that having used it for a little bit,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.720]   Matt, that this is at all possibly something to take on?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.040]   I totally do.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.960]   And now I've paired it with the Apple Bluetooth keyboard,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.520]   with any Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.880]   And it's a relatively credible screen size,
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.200]   not so different from a netbook.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.000]   But the two together are small.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.720]   We'll go fit easily into a purse or backpack.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.800]   And I think for a lot of what people do,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.120]   it's going to be more than adequate.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.560]   I don't see it really as its primary use case.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.880]   I think most people will hold it like this.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.440]   And we'll have it in their arm and they'll be watching TV
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.480]   or they'll reading the news at breakfast
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.600]   or they'll be on a train or a plane.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.920]   And I think it's very good for those times.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.040]   Well, I think we're moving past the keyboard in so many ways,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.200]   with voice and if this thing got a camera, Google goggles,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.840]   and the fact that things know where you are and all that,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.040]   the need to type is going to decrease and decrease.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.920]   Gmail did to make a special interface.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.720]   So Gina, it's just recognizing the user interface agent.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.160]   The user agent, yeah.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.800]   So you just go to Gmail the way that you normally would
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.080]   and it should detect that it's the iPad.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.640]   Can you do it with your apps account, Gina?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.360]   You don't know, I guess.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.920]   You can.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.280]   You can.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.400]   I tried it because I actually switched the user agent
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.920]   in my browser to check it out.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.120]   And you can.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.080]   And yeah, it's OK.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.680]   I mean, it doesn't have the keyboard shortcut.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.720]   I wouldn't use it on my desktop, but it looks good.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   I mean, I love the idea that you can have your both
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.440]   your inbox open and you an open message at the same time.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.120]   And that's the case for the mail app, right?
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.840]   The native mail app as well.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   But yeah, I mean, it looks nice.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.760]   It's the expanded version of the iPhone version or the Android
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.880]   version, basically.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.520]   What about the lack of multitasking?
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.680]   I mean, any Android tablet would, of course,
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   have multitasking.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.440]   How big of a deal breaker is that on a device like this?
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.240]   I don't think it's that big of a deal
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.040]   since you're just concentrating on what's happening.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.240]   I mean, it's a real good media consumption device.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.880]   So you're just concentrating on watching a movie
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.320]   or reading email and you're not doing 10 things
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   in the background on a laptop you might.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.680]   So I think it's not that big of a deal.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.400]   I have noticed with the Gmail app that's
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.480]   amazing for reading email really fast and archiving stuff.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.240]   I'm like an inbox zero dork.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.880]   So it's great for bang, bang, bang, get rid of stuff.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.280]   But it's kind of terrible for writing email.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.560]   Like, it's clunky.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.240]   The web interface isn't as nice.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.680]   And you have the cramped keyboard and stuff.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.120]   I guess that's what we said initially was it's a content
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.800]   consumption device.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.200]   People like Corey Doctorow wrote a scathing article
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.760]   saying, why I'm not going to buy an iPad,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.520]   and why you shouldn't either.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.040]   Kind of see it as the end of the world.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.000]   They really have a political objection to it, I think.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.840]   It's closed devices, DRM everywhere.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.600]   This is the war.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.400]   We are-- it's a very clear war between Android now
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.320]   and Apple here.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.920]   And Schmidt at Davos said the war is going to be one on apps.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.200]   Not on devices, not on OS, but on apps.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.160]   Well, in an app world, this is the king.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.800]   This is an app-- I mean, you couldn't get a more--
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.920]   this is it, right?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.040]   And when you talk in apps, you don't need multitasking
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.120]   because you're doing one thing at a time.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.640]   How is Buzz on this thing?
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.680]   Did they do a special-- I know I'm the only one still using it.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.760]   It's a good question.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   Doesn't look like they did.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.040]   We're going to be spending the whole show looking down.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.600]   It's the same as in Safari.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.080]   They didn't do a special-- but they could have.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.680]   They didn't do a special Google Reader.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.640]   I was really surprised.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.240]   Yeah, they did that on the iPhone when the iPhone came out.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.760]   Like, make up left pane.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.920]   Just make it like Gmail, like, feed, feed, feed,
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.040]   and the full item on the right side.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.360]   But this works a single thing.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.600]   I have to say, this works very nicely for Gmail.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.320]   I think it's a good metaphor for Gmail.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.720]   One of the things that's gotten me so far
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.440]   is the constant quest for this being the tablet for Mount Sinai
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   that's going to rescue media.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.600]   And though there's some good apps, I think that, for instance,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   the Reuters app is really superb, and as Matt said,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.840]   the ABC app is good.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.880]   But what amazes me on this is the Time magazine.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.240]   One issue.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.840]   One issue $4.99.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.160]   And so I feel awful because I bought it because I had to buy it
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.200]   because I couldn't start about it unless I actually saw it,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.600]   even though I knew I was going to start.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.480]   All it is is PDF.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.640]   Oh, that's horrible.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.160]   Dude.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.840]   That's where we are.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   It's a movable PDF.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.440]   And you go this one that way.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.560]   You know, once in a while, a video in it.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.960]   But it's just this return to editorial ego
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.160]   that I want to control the package.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.880]   And I want you to go in my order.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.720]   And the most amusing moment I had it was there's a huge ad
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.080]   in there for the wonders of droid.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.960]   That's a good placement.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.840]   That's a great placement.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.640]   Well, of course, you saw both Time and Newsweek had jobs
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.600]   in the iPad on the cover.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.240]   And you saw in the back of Newsweek
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.920]   with it, they have a big iPad on the front
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.680]   and then the back Amazon bought a big Kindle ad,
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.040]   which is probably a pretty big waste of money at this point.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.880]   Yeah, the Kindle.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   Mm.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.400]   Mm.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Mm.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.960]   I'm sensing I'm going to eat it soon
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.400]   because prices are about to go.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.000]   A lot of kindles.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.440]   The only thing is, Gene, that when I first picked up the iPad,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.280]   Kindle had given me the expectation of weight.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.200]   And the iPad felt really heavy.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.440]   Barretundeth Hurston said that was his first reaction too.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.800]   Just because compared to a laptop, it's not.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.240]   But just for this little thing in your hand,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.120]   the Kindle really has a difference.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.640]   Right.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.160]   Right.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.720]   The Kindle also feels like plastic too.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.840]   And I imagine that--
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.880]   Yeah, this feels much nicer.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.720]   --the first one.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.880]   It was a much much nicer.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.200]   iPad feels nicer.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.800]   I was watching-- I guess Barretunde hosted an iPad brunch
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.400]   today, so I was looking at some of his tweets.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.320]   And he had said, a couple of people
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.120]   had said that without 3G that the iPad was basically
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.960]   felt kind of useless when it was offline.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.640]   Has that-- have you guys had a chance to have a bot?
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.240]   That's why I also bought today the cradle point.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.360]   Or am I fine or am I fine with the choice?
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.960]   I go back to create my own Wi-Fi since I'm stuck with AT&T
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.840]   and don't have Wi-Fi.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.960]   That way I can have Wi-Fi now.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.040]   So that's why maybe decide that I could go ahead and buy this
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.680]   today without the Wi-Fi and without another AT&T account.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.280]   I think the big thing he misses is the GPS.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.240]   But how does it know where I am?
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.840]   Is it knowing-- because the maps did--
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.200]   Margaret, me, is that because of my ISP?
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.560]   I think it's Skyhook, which is a company
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.960]   that maps Wi-Fi access points.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   And they can't triangulate.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.760]   It did a good job.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.480]   I got to say it.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.040]   That's interesting because maps couldn't find me.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.600]   Let me try again on that.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.960]   Maybe it doesn't know where my Wi-Fi is.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.560]   Maybe I'm not in the Skyhook database.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.440]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.760]   Oh, because you're on some weird--
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.240]   Going back to the time app, Jeff, so tell me,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   tell us what you-- ideally, what it would look like.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.280]   So you spent $5.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.080]   What did you want to see?
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.640]   Well, it's called a browser.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.880]   The problem is I just don't want the package anymore.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.920]   I want media people to be out and ways
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.520]   to come to me and distribute across the whole web.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.120]   If I'm going to go to this package,
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.560]   if I look at the Reuters app, it mixes--
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.480]   rather than just saying this is serial product that
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.040]   goes from page one to page 100 or in times case about 35,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.320]   Reuters gives me a web-like appearance of saying,
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.520]   here's the whole world of news.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.160]   And when I go to the stock report, I can add my stocks
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.880]   and I can go to the stories I want.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.680]   It gives me that ability for me to control the experience,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.120]   where literally at time it is page, page, page, page,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.600]   as if it were a book and I don't think media should be.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.960]   Beyond that, given the limitations of what the iPad can't
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   do, it'd be nice if I could get into video comments
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.840]   or stuff like that.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.480]   But of course, it has no camera yet.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.360]   Won't do that.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   Typing is hard.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.680]   But it just shows me the hubris of the editorial package
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.760]   these days in the age of the link.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.600]   So customization.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.760]   So you think that the readers should
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.840]   be able to determine how to organize the magazine.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.200]   Basically.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.800]   Well, that there even is a magazine.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.320]   I got into a pissy fit with some newspaper guy
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.120]   in Twitter just a few minutes ago.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.040]   And he said, well, it would be a weekly.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.320]   And I said, yeah, I wouldn't have started
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.960]   an entertainment weekly today as a magazine at all,
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   quite the contrary.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.240]   And I'd have a far better business
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.160]   than they have these days.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.320]   I guess the problems, it just shows me how
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.560]   outmoded the notion of a magazine is.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.720]   And that's painful to say, actually.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.200]   Jeff, you have to be seeing a popular science.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.520]   Yeah, I was just going to ask you about that.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.120]   What does it do?
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.960]   It's like the future of what a magazine could look like.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   Let me see here.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.440]   Like--
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.640]   Go ahead.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.840]   Yeah, you can just drag and drill down
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.320]   whenever you feel like into an article.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.560]   Like, you can go in different directions.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.720]   It's like it was a big concept piece.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.440]   Now, there's a new device.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.320]   Let's try new things.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.400]   That is $5.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.600]   But then do you have to subscribe to PopSide
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   and continue to have more stuff?
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.560]   You get one issue, I think, with that $5.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.320]   And I assume new ones.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.040]   I would say for the sake of research, check it out, Jeff.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.640]   Like this truly is the future of--
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.840]   That's the same as Tom.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.360]   Do it right now, Matt.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.480]   You just made them $5.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.480]   I think you're probably not alone.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.720]   And you were saying, Matt, also the ABC app, you thought,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.200]   was a pretty promising UI.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.240]   And I think what Jeff's saying, everyone
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.520]   can be lazy with this.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.480]   Just like when podcasts came out, talk radio and TV shows
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.880]   just basically repurpose their existing content.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.840]   But then some shows kind of got it, what it could be,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.640]   something different.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.200]   And they had new material, where they had interview shows
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.720]   that were only available in podcasts.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:20.000]   So ABC looks like what TV could look like in the future.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.160]   And I'm sure if NBC comes out with an app,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.080]   it might just be click on four shows to watch a show
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.960]   or something.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.120]   It's just so clear and easy.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.240]   It's just that you--
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.400]   this is the--
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.520]   you can't see with the light.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.360]   It's a glary screen, I have to say.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.920]   Yeah, it is.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.720]   Well, it's a little better than the smudgy screen.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.840]   It also is smudgy here.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   I'll show you online.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.120]   I've got a--
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.960]   And you can dive into the daily schedule
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.720]   and click on the last two episodes you missed.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.280]   You can jump down to Thursday at 8 p.m.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.200]   from the front screen.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.280]   It's kind of cool.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.880]   I used the Netflix app.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.480]   If you have a Netflix account, you
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.280]   can stream your Netflix movie to it.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.520]   And the quality is very nice.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.720]   I mean, this is a--
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.640]   that's what I think very interesting about this.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   This is kind of a multi-homed device.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.160]   It has a use cases for everybody from the Scrabble
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.560]   fan to somebody who wants to watch a movie on a plane
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.080]   to somebody who wants to read a newspaper at breakfast.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.520]   What about the New York Times kind of did an odd thing.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.240]   They have a New York Times Select, which is a way--
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.520]   or editor's choice, I guess they call it-- a way stripped
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.080]   down version of the New York Times.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.040]   I don't understand.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.840]   I thought they were the poster child for this device.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.800]   They were on stage with jobs.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.000]   They had all kinds of stuff.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And I don't understand.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.480]   Did somebody drop the ball there or what?
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.280]   Well, at least it's free.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.880]   I mean, that's--
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.920]   and it's very legible.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.160]   It's very readable.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.720]   No pinch and zoom.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   You have to just tap on things and you
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.080]   can't get it bigger or smaller.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.720]   It does seem like--
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.360]   Meanwhile, the New York Times increased
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.720]   the price of its Kindle app, which is not very satisfying.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.480]   Right.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.360]   And there's this ad supported, by the way.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.840]   This has ads.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.480]   I have to think that eventually they're
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.520]   going to do a paid version or maybe a version for--
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.560]   who are people who are already subscribing or that kind of thing.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.600]   This is just kind of a web page and not even
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.800]   as functional as the web page, which
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.040]   is a little frustrating, a little exactly what
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.880]   you're talking about, Jeff, which is the wrong way to go.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.240]   You know, we started discussing this last week.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.920]   And I'd be really eager to hear all your thoughts on this.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.520]   I've been arguing for a while that we're moving from a page
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.160]   based destination based web to a stream flow based web.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.200]   But then we also see the other alternative here
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.960]   is we move from a page and site based web to an app based web.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:43.800]   Where you do have closed worlds, they do have more control.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.600]   You can't or don't need to really multitask.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.640]   The concern I have for that is it becomes more walled garden
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.140]   ish.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.200]   It becomes more about looking just the stuff in my brand.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.760]   And so we go back to kind of a media destination brand thing.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.400]   And I don't know if that's going to work long term.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.320]   But I do see that starting to happen here.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.400]   And I even wonder when we get to web apps in Chrome OS,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.680]   whether that's the case.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.320]   I can't get my head around whether apps of the future
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.400]   are just a last minute salve to the pain of big old media
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.760]   brands.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.640]   And of course, the simplicity of apps rapidly disappears
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   as people start to do more sophisticated ones.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.000]   This is Autodesk Sketchpad.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.120]   It has all sorts of odd features.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.400]   And in fact, it looks more complicated to me
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.600]   than anything I would see on a desktop.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.800]   And in order to get more powerful apps on here,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.160]   you have to kind of play with the UI in ways
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.080]   that I think are non-intuitive.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.440]   I think maybe it's best to think of this
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.040]   as a content consumption device, a player.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.200]   And even as much as Corey didn't like it,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.640]   the idea that you still can use the browser gives you some hope
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.000]   that I could still go to the New York Times in my browser
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.360]   and read the paper there, right?
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.600]   Yes.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.520]   It seems like apps, though, feel like this way to like--
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.160]   here's a way to access the web, totally sanitized
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.200]   and totally on the terms of the person who made the app
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.000]   and approved by Apple.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.440]   You still have to have this filter, this gatekeeper.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.600]   If they took the browser out, I'd feel worse about it.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.000]   Oh, well, yeah, definitely, definitely.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.880]   Yeah, that's not even Apple's fault necessarily.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.440]   It's time magazines fault for saying,
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.400]   this is how we view our relationship with our public.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.880]   Start here, then go there.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.200]   Right.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.720]   Right.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.920]   Start a page one and go to page two.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.880]   I mean, it's the app stuff.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.280]   But I really agree with Gina on this.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:49.400]   Yeah, that's the mood that bothers me here.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.840]   Yeah, this idea that apps are this way to sanitize the web,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.480]   a way to access the web, but through a very
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   tightly controlled channel.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.400]   I mean, this is not bad.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.520]   I'm looking at the New York Times in Safari.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.520]   And it has pinch, which is I can zoom in on stuff
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.800]   which I can't do in the New York Times app.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.760]   So if they're trying to drive people to the web,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.920]   maybe that's what these silly apps are for.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.480]   I mean, this works nicely.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.080]   It rotates.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.280]   It does everything I'd want.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.760]   And this is the web page.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.480]   It's got all the features of the web page.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:35.640]   So Leo, before we went on, I was watching your feed on my iPad.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.520]   Yeah, isn't that cool?
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.560]   It stopped after a few--
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.160]   after two or three minutes each time.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.760]   But that was cool.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.080]   So it's not--
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.680]   That's HTML5--
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.480]   It is HTML5.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.960]   --and HTML5.64, yeah.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.600]   So obviously, if you're watching the show on live.tv,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.280]   you're watching it in Flash.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.440]   But if you go to live--
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.080]   now, actually, I should take a look
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.360]   and see how this works.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.600]   If you go to live.tv on the iPhone,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.440]   we see the user agent and we present you
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.160]   with a special page.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.360]   And I think we've set that up.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.880]   Yes, we have.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.400]   Yes, you have.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.600]   Well, at least that's worked out.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.560]   So you can get an application that does this, too.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.720]   We have a 99 cent application that lets you watch.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.400]   And it has more stuff than the web page does,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.120]   because it has the chat room and has the calendar
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.280]   and some other things built into an interface
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.360]   designed for this screen.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:21.680]   So--
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.760]   For the iPad.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.160]   It's an iPad version of our app.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   OK, so--
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.480]   We're running another 99 cents.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.400]   Well, this was free.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.480]   And I told the guy who wrote it, charge for it,
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.680]   because you put a lot of work into it.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.200]   And so the chat room is in there and you can join it.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.760]   I'm not crazy.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.480]   We're going to work on the design a little bit.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.040]   It's a little post-modern sci-fi.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.200]   But that's the point is it does work.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.440]   That's so bad.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.840]   So as a content creator--
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.440]   As a content creator, I think this is really a nice thing to have.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.360]   But it's not necessary.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.520]   And our business model doesn't--
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.760]   I think maybe this is the key.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.000]   It doesn't require you use this or any other way.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.280]   We want to make-- our goal is to make it--
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.600]   and I think this is what every content creator should
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.240]   be aspiring to make it available in as many ways as possible.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.400]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.400]   The idea that a media brand is still
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.800]   a magnet that will draw us doesn't work anymore.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.000]   The media have to go to where the people are.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.120]   But we can do that because we're ad-supported content.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.320]   So eyeballs are good for us.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.560]   And as long as we get more eyeballs, it pays for itself.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.360]   And we can count them.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.760]   That's kind of important, too, the ability to count them.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.920]   But we want you to listen.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.640]   We want you to watch.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.560]   We want you to download whatever makes sense for you.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   That makes us happy.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.120]   That seems like the only way to do it, frankly.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.680]   I think that's where media is.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.920]   And selling a $4.99--
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.160]   but we've never done that.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.120]   We've never sold-- by Twig 36 for a buck.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.280]   We've never done that.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.640]   I mean, I think you have opportunities
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.880]   to do other revenue streams like direct sales
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.600]   and merchandise.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.800]   If I go to the--
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.480]   I forget the name of the--
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.200]   ah, what was my old phone with the old Palm
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.600]   phone with my little keyboard on it?
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.720]   Oh, the trio?
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.220]   Trio.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:14.720]   Trio.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.600]   So trio knots.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.720]   And it was a great blog that now has the Nexus 1 site
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   and so on and so forth.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.160]   And they're making a business out of direct sales
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.160]   and merchandise.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.520]   The stuff you talk about, I think you could do a Best Buy
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.560]   store at Twig and Twig, where you could sell direct merchandise.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.880]   And it's just basically another way to advertise
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.520]   is you're getting paid on true performance.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.080]   Right.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.520]   Yeah, we looked at all those models.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.440]   That's just easier for me to just put an ad in the damn thing.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.480]   Yeah, no.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.400]   At some point, you could hire a head of merchandising
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.480]   who could probably make you some money there.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.240]   I think you could have events.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.240]   I mean, look at the turnout they get for the dignity
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   of the day.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   Exactly.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   Exactly.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.360]   I mean, and all those-- well, the chat room is the proof.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.200]   Hey, chat roomers, wouldn't you like to meet in person
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.400]   or would that frighten you too much?
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.200]   That's scary.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.240]   So Gina, I wish I could do this.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.800]   We have a request from Johann Hillerstrom on Twitter
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.320]   to try out Wave on the iPad.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   Oh.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:14.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.480]   Well, so if you-- this is what I think is going to happen.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.040]   But you guys can tell me-- if you guys go to wave.google.com
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.200]   in Safari, you will probably get a message
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.000]   saying that the browser isn't up to snuff.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.400]   But there's a great iPhone app called Waveboard, which
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.080]   is available.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.400]   I think there's a version that's free,
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.720]   and I think there's one that's like $2.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.160]   I've got it.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.880]   And I'm not sure if-- oh, you have Waveboard?
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.920]   I think Waveboard is probably the best way to try it out.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.880]   I don't know if he really-- or the developer released
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.440]   a an iPad version.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.760]   But hopefully.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.640]   But yeah, I've been thinking that Wave would render really
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.560]   nicely on the iPad because you just have a lot more room.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.680]   Yeah, that's looking good, Leo.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.240]   Look at that.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.440]   And that's in Safari.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.480]   And now, did you click-- did you have to click a go ahead link
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.600]   when you--
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.680]   OK, just load up-- oh, that's great.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.160]   That's great.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.560]   So I can-- yeah, I mean, this is a very nice touch.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.120]   Makes sense in touch, you know.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.320]   Wave just crashed my Safari.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.960]   They just crashed mine.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.440]   Wow.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.520]   And it just crashed mine.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.840]   So we'll have to use the app.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.480]   You know, even the iPhone apps that aren't designed for the iPad,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.640]   usually scale pretty much.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.160]   You know, you'll be able to use them, especially if it's just text.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.640]   So you see the UI, the widgets that don't work scale so well
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.400]   because they don't have the bitmaps.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.520]   So I'll confess my stupidity with the thing.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.240]   I had to sync like three or four times because every time I
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.480]   sanked and I went to the iPod app, I'd say, where the hell
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.840]   are my videos and TV shows?
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.320]   So I'd sync again and I didn't realize there's a separate button
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.840]   on this thing for video.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.000]   There is some usability stuff that you have to get used to.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.480]   There are some different stuff.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.560]   And you have to charge it separately than syncing?
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.480]   It doesn't charge--
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.240]   Depends on what you're-- no, you can charge it.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.320]   If you plug it into the back of an iMac or a laptop,
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.680]   it should--
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   it has a 10 watt adapter.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   But some people are reporting-- it
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.320]   didn't work on my USB hub, my powered hub.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.960]   Some people are reporting it won't work on some devices.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.360]   But it's variable.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.280]   It takes a lot of juice.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.640]   But you know, you get in the battery life.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.040]   People are getting as amazing.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.540]   Right.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.360]   Walt Walsberg said it was actually more than Apple promised.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:28.720]   You got what?
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.600]   11 and 1/2 hours to maximum use, right?
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.920]   And so that's-- it's so did Andy and I co-so did a lot of people.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.280]   So that's pretty impressive.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.320]   I'm at 62%.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.600]   And I haven't charged it at all.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.120]   This is out of the box.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.840]   So I think that you're going to-- this
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.640]   is going to kind of thing.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.160]   You're going to be able to use all day.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.840]   Speaking of Mossberg, what fascinated me
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.040]   was Mossberg versus David Pogue in the Times,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.240]   where Mossberg's take, as we said earlier, was, wow,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.640]   could this really take some major function of the laptop?
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.320]   Whereas Pogue wrote two separate reviews.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.360]   And really what he was saying was,
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.960]   it's your grandma's computer.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.720]   Right.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.560]   Yep.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.120]   I think that's doing grandma disservice, by the way.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.360]   Poor grandma.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.720]   She's always the whipping girl.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.360]   I'm using this.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.760]   I think a lot of geeks are using it,
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.800]   and are very happy with it.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.920]   So we'll see.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.800]   The proof will be in a month or two
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.160]   if we're still using it as a primary device,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.520]   or if we've gone back to our laptops and said,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.080]   that was nice.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.360]   That was fun.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.280]   My best use case I could imagine so far
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.360]   is I'm going in two weeks to Germany to a conference called
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.800]   Republica, which I think is the kind of German-speaking
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.520]   South by Southwest.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.840]   And I could imagine spending all day at a conference
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.000]   with this thing.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:42.980]   Really?
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.680]   Watch the Twitter doing this, doing that.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.160]   Yeah, not having to lug around the laptop
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.200]   worry about the battery power.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.240]   I could see this.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.920]   You're dubious, Gina.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.440]   But taking notes and sessions?
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.880]   Yeah, a little bit, because I don't take gigantic notes.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.360]   Right, right.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.400]   Just jot, quick, quick, bang.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.840]   20 of the keyboard like, anyway.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.880]   I mean, how bad is the key?
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.560]   How bad or how good is the keyboard?
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.920]   Can you type out a sentence pretty comfortably,
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.000]   or does it feel strange?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.440]   I keep stroking the wrong keys, but then I do that especially
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.720]   on my Nexus 1 as well.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.640]   Next one.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.040]   See, I tend to-- so at night, if I'm watching TV,
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.680]   or watching something that I don't really care about very
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.360]   much, I often will have my phone with me,
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.960]   and we'll be browsing Twitter, and just checking email,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.880]   and archiving email, that kind of thing.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.600]   And so I can imagine using the iPad for that.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.040]   But I often need to answer emails,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.680]   and I often need to quote emails and answer in line.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.880]   And that kind of thing isn't easy to do on the phone, for sure.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.960]   And it doesn't sound like it would
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.320]   be easy to do on the iPad as well.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.040]   I mean, I guess I feel like I type or I input information.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.920]   More than-- maybe I'm more of a creator than a consumer.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   Yeah, you're a programmer.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   I think that's the case.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.080]   And I think I'll be the same way.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.880]   You actually create useful things.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.760]   I just create words.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   But--
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.760]   Words are useful, Jack.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.400]   Words are useful.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.760]   It's all words.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.240]   [COUGHING]
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.920]   Leo's calling away from there.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.520]   Leo's-- that's looking pretty comfortable.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.560]   Did you actually say something right, or does it--
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.960]   It's pretty good.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.320]   I would love to see a shape writer or swipe on the iPad.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.440]   That's what I would love to see.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.200]   I was talking about that with Jake today, too.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.680]   I wonder whether-- because he said, you know,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.760]   you can't write on the darn thing.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.960]   And he said, I would have sold it with a pen.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.400]   And I think that probably brings back horrible memories.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.600]   No, yeah, we don't want that.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.600]   Right.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.000]   Definitely don't want that.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.960]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.040]   It's kind of weird to have a more normal keyboard,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.920]   but still have these kind of strange iPhone replacement
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.520]   things going on and all of that stuff.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.280]   It's going to take a little getting used to.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   But no, I think this is quite usable.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.800]   Yeah, and that looks--
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.280]   That's a plus.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.400]   I never carried a computer.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.640]   I just used my phone the whole time.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.560]   I could totally see using this at a conference.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.880]   Because I was using like four square and Twitter.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   And I was even taking notes in the notes app,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.120]   just a sentence here and there.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   I think this could totally work at a conference.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.560]   Yeah, you wouldn't want to write a program in a geno,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.000]   probably.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.840]   But--
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.560]   Yeah, no, that's definitely not.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.040]   It's pretty darn usable.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   Actually, I'm surprised.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.000]   This is the first time I've used it.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.160]   Now, I paired it immediately with a Bluetooth keyboard,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.720]   and then it just uses a regular keyboard,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.800]   and that's very usable.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.280]   If you prop this up like this, it
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.440]   would be no different than a laptop,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.480]   except there's no mouse.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.400]   Oh, right, yeah.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.120]   It's a touchscreen laptop.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:27.280]   All right, there is Google News.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.000]   Google.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.600]   Who's that?
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.240]   Google.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:29.680]   Google.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.640]   The Google has been up to something, I believe.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.320]   Well, there's a redesign on YouTube.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.680]   We actually-- this kind of bit us.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.040]   We were trying to upload some video a couple of nights ago,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.640]   and we couldn't.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.120]   We didn't know what was going on, and then we found out.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.160]   Oh, they're changing the UI on YouTube.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.280]   Pretty nice, too, I think.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.880]   A very clean, graphically much simpler interface.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.560]   Anybody have an opinion on it?
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.320]   It looked like a beta when I first saw it.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.760]   It kind of looked like, did they really make that live?
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.120]   I mean, it's kind of cool that half the stuff's gone,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.080]   but it feels like an early CSS draft of a page to me,
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.400]   because there's just like--
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.920]   I think it's too simple.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.280]   Yeah, I couldn't find other videos from this user.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.680]   Going down the side, all I saw was related videos
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.480]   from everybody in YouTube.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.000]   So it felt like it took away a feature at first,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.440]   and it's just sort of raw.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.400]   It's all HTML text.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.920]   There's lack of graphics.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.440]   I mean, it looked a little rough.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.880]   It looks like when you have a designer who works in CSS
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.000]   with early mockups you'll get before a site launch
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.960]   will look a lot like the new YouTube page.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.280]   And then YouTube was useless for a day.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.040]   Every single video's comments was,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.960]   I hate the look of this page.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.680]   I want to hear about the video, not.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.280]   They got rid of the star system for voting.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.480]   They replaced that with a thumbs up thumbs down,
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.920]   a very, very dig like system.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.080]   They said, because people only use zero stars or five stars.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.520]   They never very rarely did anything in between.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.400]   But you're right, there are things like,
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.320]   it's harder to find stuff.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.360]   But then the embed looks kind of nice.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.880]   You can mess with it a little bit here.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.960]   I don't know.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.320]   I like it that it's cleaner.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.080]   I think it was getting pretty crafty.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.280]   But I can see what you're saying that some of the things
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.120]   that you might be used to.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.960]   - But that way you say about that design,
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.800]   isn't that kind of truth?
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.680]   Everything out of Google?
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.280]   - Yeah, I mean, let's talk about the beautiful design
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.840]   of the iPad and then Google's web app design.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.680]   - Yeah.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.720]   - It's a difference.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.480]   I obviously love Google.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.720]   That's why we're here, but yikes.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.880]   Although the little page tour is pretty neat.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.280]   I confess I'm not a big YouTuber,
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.200]   so this is the first time really looking at this.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.880]   But if you click on the take a quick tour thing,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.240]   it kind of takes you around the page in a neat little way.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.840]   - Oh yeah, where's that?
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.200]   - On the right hand side, there's a blue box
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.560]   that says welcome to the new video page.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.040]   - Oh, okay.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:53.880]   - I don't know if--
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.360]   - I guess I've taken that already.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.080]   Maybe I've taken it already.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.640]   - Just go to like an individual.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.240]   Oh, you might have, you can connect it out.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.080]   - I've now I'm going to a Walmart ad.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.920]   - Stop.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.760]   - Okay.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.600]   - Stop.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   - No ads unless they pay here.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.840]   - Yeah.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.800]   Well anyway, all right.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.640]   So there you go.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.480]   There you have it.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.680]   New YouTube interface.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.520]   There's a Google story.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.000]   - I'm along together with big news and video
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.640]   and Google is the Google bot episodic.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.760]   - No, what's episodic?
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.480]   - It's pretty good to ask me that.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.000]   I believe that it is a service that enables people
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.480]   to do episodic TV better and have the functionality
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.800]   to do that including organizing episodes
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.240]   across a series, charging for subscriptions
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.080]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.720]   - Yeah, it's another ad platform.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.560]   - Well, it's another ad, but it's also another
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.800]   SOP2 media companies, I think SOP2,
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.040]   but another opportunity for media companies
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.960]   to create episodic TV.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.040]   Jeff Palmer was one of the few other people
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.280]   who some time ago tried to create guides to episodic TV
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   and separate episodic from the one off viral stuff.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.360]   Blip has kind of emphasized episodic as well.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.080]   And episodic of course is the loyalty
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.040]   of television itself.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.680]   So I think there may be something in here
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.520]   that shows the direction for Google
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.640]   and its relationship to media companies
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.400]   and the wisdom of trying to get past viral.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.200]   'Cause you can't really control viral.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.400]   I was at a really good conference at Columbia this last week
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.720]   called the Bright BRITE 10 Conference
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.680]   and I got up something for you name,
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   Chief Research Scientist for Yahoo Australian.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.640]   It'll come to me.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.160]   Was there talking about research they did
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.480]   on influencers and Twitter.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.120]   And it really struck me at some point
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.920]   that there is no such thing as an influencer,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.360]   that it's the messages that are usually influential.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.800]   And the problem in that is that you can't bottle it
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.920]   and resell it, which is why marketers hate to hear this.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.120]   And the problem for YouTube then
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.880]   is you can't predict bottle, resell and figure out
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.600]   of obviously when things go viral there.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.000]   And they're kind of dependent upon that.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And if they're gonna put advertising on things,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.680]   better to put on something that has a loyal,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.040]   returning audience, which has demographics you can predict.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:17.000]   - Yeah, well I think that if in a way
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.120]   this also goes hand in hand with a YouTube redesign
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.840]   because really what they're creating is a place
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.880]   not where you put groin shots and lip syncing,
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.480]   but a place where mainstream media types
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   and maybe some smaller ones are gonna put their content.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.800]   And I think that in some ways that's kind of an antithetical
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.600]   to what YouTube started YouTube and what YouTube is all about.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.000]   I mean if YouTube becomes a hulu,
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.360]   will it still be desirable?
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.160]   It feels like a bait and switch,
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.400]   actually probably be more desirable,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.560]   but it feels like a bait and switch.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.440]   Like you came to YouTube for chocolate rain
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.200]   and you left with 30 rock.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.480]   - I can't share both, don't they live happily together?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.560]   - Can you?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.040]   - Yeah, I don't think it's a zero-sum game.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.560]   I think YouTube's just trying to become like Google,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.080]   like all encompassing, all video is just think YouTube,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.360]   just like any search you think Google.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.440]   - Right, okay, yeah you're right.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.400]   I think the advertisers though are a little unhappy
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.680]   with the idea that they might show up in a groin kick video.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.200]   That's why they do wanna separate out
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.800]   and they wanna know kind of an authoritative rule
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.200]   of who are the good people who are making reliable stuff,
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.080]   who can we count on?
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.000]   - Yeah, so there is pressure I would imagine
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.080]   on a platform like YouTube to kind of,
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.920]   if you wanna be a good platform for advertisers,
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.120]   then you wanna have some way of kind of,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.960]   this isn't this is a problem MySpace had, still does,
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.760]   which is nobody wanted to buy an ad on MySpace
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.600]   'cause you had no idea where your ad was gonna end up.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.640]   - But Leo, aren't you the perfect person to judge this?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.920]   I mean, if Google came to you and said,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.840]   we now have a better platform for you to organize
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.920]   and present the episodes of the wonderful--
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.840]   - Well, exactly.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.680]   - Yeah.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.800]   - And because you're Leo, the port we love and trust you,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.040]   and because we Google have huge advertising contracts
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   and content, we'll sell you on or off YouTube.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.680]   Wouldn't that be music to your ears?
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.360]   - Yeah, well, and we're doing it, basically.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.200]   - Okay.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.000]   - You know, we're putting all our content,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.160]   including this show on YouTube.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.040]   We have a YouTube.com/twit
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.640]   and there's channels for every show there
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.880]   and I would love better episode controlling things.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.600]   I just think in time to what happens is there's pressure
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.440]   on people like YouTube to get rid of the kid stuff
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.200]   and the lip syncing stuff.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.400]   And I think that that actually could be a problem for it
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.240]   because what they sell people like me and NBC and ABC
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.240]   is a crowd, they sell the audience.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.800]   But if the audience is coming to watch "Numa Numa,"
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.920]   I don't know if that's the right.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.080]   It doesn't seem to me, it does seem a zero-sum game
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.920]   to me for some reason, man.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.760]   I don't know why.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.240]   - I think Google's like, it's just like with blogs, right?
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.200]   There's 20 million zillion blogs.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.400]   They're not very useful, they're not very ad friendly, I guess,
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.040]   to advertisers, but Google figured out this magical tool.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.480]   Like, you know, it's a total long tail thing
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.240]   to make, you know, like AdSense work on those ages,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.840]   no matter what someone's talking about.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.800]   I think with like the millions of random videos,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.520]   you think like, I don't know, one to 5% are really good
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.720]   and kind of rise above and, you know, I guess they go viral,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.200]   but they also, you know, there might be good work done
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.520]   by an independent.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.480]   And then, you know, Google's gonna flow ads to that.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.680]   I think they don't know the answer to the question
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.760]   of how do we monetize all these videos for grandma,
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.080]   but they will, you know, someday.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.480]   - Someday, yeah. - Someone's 20%.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.480]   (laughs)
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.160]   Someone's 20% time.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.000]   - Yeah.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.520]   - Another trick to this is that, and Hulu kind of ruined it
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.880]   because of the business deal going awry,
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   but you take shows like Colbert and Daily Show,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.080]   and you turn them into snippets, you snippetize them.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.640]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.600]   - So you get the best bits and the best bits become
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.200]   your best marketing for the rest,
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.080]   which the networks have realized.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.320]   - So they get that idea.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.240]   They don't feel like it's cannibalizing there.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.080]   - I think that's what they thought was that it in a live,
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.200]   is that, well, all the funny parts are on YouTube.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.920]   So nobody has any incentive to watch the show.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.880]   - I mean, years ago, going back, you know, four years ago,
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.160]   Betsy Morgan, who most recently was the CEO of Huffington Post,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.840]   was then at CBS, said that when somebody put up
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.600]   a pirated clip from Letterman, they would do the takedown,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.520]   but then put up the exact same clip themselves.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.600]   - Ah, interesting. - And tell the person
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.760]   here it is.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.680]   - Uh-huh.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.840]   - Because it is a recommendation.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.760]   It's somebody that's smart.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.240]   It's somebody, I don't know if they do that anymore.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   - Now, why would they do that?
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.320]   Tell me that, tell me.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.160]   - 'Cause it was like-- - 'Cause it was like
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.480]   a quality, they put up like a HD version.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.320]   - Oh, I see.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.040]   - Was it some-- - So they knew somebody wanted it.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.920]   - Right.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.040]   And that's the smart thing to do.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.320]   I don't know if they still do it at CBS,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.040]   'cause CBS doesn't, you know, isn't as forward
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.760]   they can't think now, but that's the way
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.080]   to take advantage of this.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.200]   And then you make your stuff
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.360]   embeddable around the whole web.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.160]   That's to me where media has to go,
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.360]   is it all media have to become embeddable.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.240]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with more,
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.480]   our guests, Matt Howie, the man who started
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.160]   Metafilter, Metafilter.com.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.520]   It's great to have you, Matt.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.480]   You said the Saturdays are bad for you.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.520]   We found a time when you weren't busy.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.400]   - Yeah. - Dying Easter eggs,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.960]   or hiding them or anything like that.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.400]   Also, Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com,
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.520]   the author of "What Would Google Do?"
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.120]   And the great Gina Trapani of the complete wave,
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.080]   whoop, that's not you.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.120]   There you are, completewaveguide.com.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.200]   And her blog is smarterware.org.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   But, we want to take a little break.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.440]   You may wander off people's
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.320]   because I'm gonna talk about GoToAssist.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.560]   No, not you, not the audience.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.960]   - Oh no, no, the audience stays there.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.800]   Unless there's this word message.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.840]   - You stay, or take the iPod with you.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.520]   The iPad, it's made for going to the bathroom.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.480]   Just take it on with you.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.720]   That's exactly what Steve Jobs said.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.040]   He never, he never won.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.760]   He didn't wanna make basically a bathroom computer,
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.160]   but he has.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   So, I wanna talk a little bit about GoToAssist.com.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   You know, the folks at Citrix,
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.000]   they are pretty impressive.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.400]   They really have got the Remote Access thing down.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.080]   In fact, I know they're doing iPad apps
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.320]   for some of their products.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.920]   It's very exciting.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.160]   GoToAssist is for Max and Windows,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.960]   designed to help you if you're a support professional,
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   an IT professional.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.720]   It uses their Remote Access technology
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.840]   to make it easier for you to do remote support.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:49.000]   You can be a support hero.

[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.680]   If you're a part-time support person,
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.920]   if you're a full-time support person,
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.760]   you'll love the features.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.960]   Like you can run eight different sessions at the same time.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.440]   So, start a scan, move to the next one,
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.000]   start an install, move to the next one.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.880]   You can copy install files or fixes or patches
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.960]   from your computer to the guest computer.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.000]   You can see what's running on the computer you're supporting,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.760]   but what operating system, what security software,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.160]   what software in the background,
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.000]   and go on and on.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.440]   It really is designed for support.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.520]   A great way to do it.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.200]   You can even let the person you're supporting
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.160]   look at your computer.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.400]   Or if they're not there, you can do it on 10/s support.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.440]   Go to assist.com/towig.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.280]   Give it a try today.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.640]   30 days, absolutely free.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   The folks at Citrix, go to assist.com/towig.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.240]   So, we had a droid user in the studio today
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.760]   who was very, what is that?
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.600]   You got there, Jeff.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.960]   - Well, is it, is it, is it, is it an iPad app?
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.800]   - Yes, it is.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.640]   - I'm just gonna say.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.480]   - Yes, it is.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.200]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.240]   You can do your, see, that's a great application for this.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.680]   It's just, instead of carrying a laptop,
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.520]   you're just going to a meeting.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.680]   Well, you just have this.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.080]   I mean, I can think of a lot of good applications for it.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   Anyway, we had a droid user in the show yesterday.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.480]   He said 2.1.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.120]   It's finally being pushed out by Verizon.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.920]   - Oh yeah, my brother got his today too.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.280]   - How old were you?
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.200]   - My brother texted me to say,
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.760]   "Hey, I updated 2.1 all by myself without calling you.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.840]   Aren't you proud?
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.160]   I've been his Android kind of consultant.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.880]   So shout out to my brother Joey.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.720]   Nice job, though.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.640]   - Hey, Joey, well done.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.120]   - And he's watching right now.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.440]   - Hey, Joey.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.480]   (laughs)
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.320]   Is he in Brooklyn?
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   Where is he?
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.160]   - In New Jersey.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.000]   - In New Jersey.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:37.840]   - Close enough.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.120]   - So this has been a problem.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.160]   - You got a problem with that?
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.080]   - Yeah.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.480]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.080]   This has been a problem though,
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.320]   is this fragmentation you got.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.440]   I had somebody call the radio show
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.480]   and said, "I have an Aorus 1.6."
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.320]   And you're watching the Motorola Droid get updated,
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.560]   but not the Motorola Aorus.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.880]   It's gotta be frustrating.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.760]   According to Engadget,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:03.800]   off the record, Chris Ziegler writing for Engadget says,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.600]   "People told him at CTIA that the next version of Android,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   Froyo."
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   - Froyo, baby.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   (laughs)
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.520]   It's not pastries, it's desserts.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.360]   - It's desserts.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.920]   We thought it was baked goods.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.960]   - We did.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.000]   Cupcake, donut, egg-clear, Froyo.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.720]   - Froyo will take big strides
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.880]   towards stopping this OS fragmentation.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.120]   You've got, as a developer,
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.480]   to do four different versions
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.440]   if you want to run on 151620 and 21.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.040]   So how do they fix it?
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.160]   - Well, they're gonna be decoupling the apps
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.760]   from the operating system,
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.320]   so that they can push out updates
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.840]   to apps like Maps and Gmail and all that
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.040]   through the market, as usual.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.920]   And I think that's the main thing.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:56.440]   And then Gingerbread, which comes after Froyo,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.400]   is gonna be, basically they've been iterating the platform,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.520]   they've been iterating Android faster than carriers
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.080]   or carriers rather, have been pushing out updates.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.080]   So I think things are gonna slow down a little more
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.280]   with Gingerbread, so they're gonna decouple those apps
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.120]   and they're gonna keep,
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.360]   which will actually be good for people like SyannaGen,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.600]   who had to decouple those apps
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.720]   in order to distribute his ROM
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.160]   because the apps are closed source
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.280]   and Android itself is open source.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.000]   So this sounds like a good solution coming up
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.200]   and it sounds like they're,
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.240]   this'll be a step toward doing that anyway.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.760]   - Good, good, good.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.440]   - So carriers drag their feet and still say
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.040]   that like with Eris, there's all those custom weather apps
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.680]   and desktop managers, can't they just say,
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.120]   well, it doesn't run in 2.1 or 2.2 or 2.3.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.520]   So we're gonna stay on 1.6 or something.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.360]   - Right.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.440]   - I mean, that'd be my fear.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.480]   - And we've seen--
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.000]   - My droid currently claims it's up to date.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.840]   - Oh man.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.000]   - And it's 2.01, come on.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.480]   - Oh man, I hate it when that happens.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.960]   - Flying to me.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.600]   - Yeah, it is really the carriers, isn't it?
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.040]   However, so this is really designed to make it easier
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.520]   for developers to create apps.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.400]   Are they gonna make universal apps?
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.040]   - Well, I think that, I mean,
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.880]   they're gonna decouple the sort of built in Google apps, right?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.560]   So like Maps and the Gmail client, for example,
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.200]   are just come with the distribution.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.240]   This is how I understand it.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.320]   So like those things are gonna be just separate
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.040]   in the market as usual and get an update,
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.880]   so get pushed out.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.680]   So I'll be able to update those apps the usual way
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.880]   versus having to wait for the whole OS update to get out.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.720]   - I see.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.040]   Well, that's good news.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.360]   I mean, they gotta do something about this.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.760]   This is the single biggest problem.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   And complexity is the problem.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.840]   And that's what happens when you compare
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.840]   iPhone and iPad to Droid and Android.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.280]   Is it, it's more power, but also more complexity?
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.840]   Is there a way to simplify it?
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.320]   I mean, you certainly don't wanna shoot yourself
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.040]   in the foot by having more OS versions than you need to.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.280]   That's just unnecessary complexity.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.560]   - Right, right.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.240]   - I had a problem with web development.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.880]   I think I just added as a twig bookmark.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.360]   I bought an Aris and a Droid on one day in December
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.880]   to start testing out Metafilter and other apps.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.840]   And like our actual web apps look completely different
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.720]   because one was in 1.5 maybe,
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.960]   and the other one was running 2.0.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.240]   And I was like, I had to come up with different CSS.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.200]   Come on, like it's crazy.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.640]   They look completely different.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   But eventually I think the Aris updated to two.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.040]   - Let's see, other choices in the other things
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.080]   we can take a look at.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.040]   - There's OAuth and Gmail.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.320]   - Yeah, well, that's a big deal, isn't it?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.160]   What does it mean?
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.000]   - It is a big deal.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.440]   OAuth is cool.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.880]   And I only know it's cool because I'm using it
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.840]   to authorize the software application I'm working on,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.400]   Think Tank with Twitter.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.520]   So OAuth is a way for a user to grant an application
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.600]   access to their data without giving their password, right?
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.760]   So like, there's this program called Gmail Drive
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.720]   that you can download to your desktop and you can store,
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.040]   you can just drag and drop files to it
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.920]   and it'll store it in your Gmail account.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.440]   If to enter your username and password into this,
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.880]   you know, your Gmail username and password
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.920]   into this application, which is not a Google application
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.120]   and it should make you feel weird
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.960]   and not wanna do it.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.520]   It's a security issue.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.880]   OAuth lets you authorize an application,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   say I'm gonna let Gmail Drive or any other application
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.200]   access my data and you can define the terms,
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.400]   you can say read right, you can say read only
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.160]   without handing over your password.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.400]   So it's great 'cause it means you can change your password,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.680]   you can change your Gmail password
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.320]   and all your applications don't break.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.080]   It means that you can limit the kind of access
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.320]   that an application has to your data,
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.360]   so read or read right, and you can,
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.000]   if an application starts to behave in a way
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.840]   that you don't like, you can deny it access
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.160]   from within Gmail.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.680]   So basically what it means is that an application
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   like Gmail Drive can, you can authorize
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.400]   without giving your password and you can also just have web apps
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.400]   do things with your Gmail that Gmail doesn't currently do.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.920]   So the first, I believe the first application
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.760]   that's using OAuth is this iPhone application
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.680]   called Smart Push, which filters notifications on email.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   Now I haven't tried out Smart Push by myself,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.600]   but I believe that you can say,
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.360]   only notify me of new Gmail if it comes from someone
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.000]   in my contacts or define a list of rules.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.840]   So this is pretty cool.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.680]   So Gmail had Gmail Labs for awhile,
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.160]   where they could roll out experimental features,
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.800]   but not anyone could write a Gmail Lab feature,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.320]   like only in Google, could you write a Gmail Lab feature,
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.880]   but with OAuth access beyond iMap and Pob,
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   you can really kind of build web applications
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:52.640]   on top of Gmail and access Gmail data and do things with it.
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.920]   - So is this beyond just simply the identity
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.520]   of Facebook Connect and Friend Connect being out there?
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.960]   This is more of an integrate,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.160]   kind of an API without identity?
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.080]   - Right, it's an API to your inbox
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.800]   without giving your password over.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.120]   So I think a Neil put tweeted something like,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.160]   I love it if Dropbox automatically imported all my,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.640]   any attachments I get in my Gmail,
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.160]   Dropbox is given to access and just automatically,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.800]   but my Dropbox, that kind of thing.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.520]   - It like Redux, I think he was talking about that.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.080]   - And Gina, didn't you guys break that story
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.640]   on Life Hacker a couple years ago,
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.080]   the famous Gmail archiver that stole people's username
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.240]   and password? - Yes.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.240]   (laughs)
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.800]   - So I mean, that's the worry, right?
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.120]   That unchecked someone, some unscrupulous developer
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.960]   could be transmitting your username and password
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.400]   up to their server.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.240]   - Right.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.840]   - And that's not a big deal with Twitter.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.760]   I feel bad putting my username and password into any app,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.200]   but Google, I mean, my Twitter username and password,
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.520]   whatever, they can make art jokes under my name, big deal.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.080]   Both Google, it's like my AdSense,
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.160]   like, monies, thousands of dollars are coming in every month,
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.960]   my bank account information, my Google Health,
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.400]   you know, they could be looking at my medical tests.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   Like, if you get my Google password,
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.680]   I mean, you get my life.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.760]   It's, I mean, it's crazy how much of my life's in Google
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.680]   and it's been creeping up year after year,
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   but I really am nervous about giving out my Google username
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.280]   and password to anything.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.480]   Like, I hardly ever use Google Reader apps for anything,
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.400]   like the iPhone.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.040]   - Well, that's probably why there weren't very many,
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.880]   as far as I know, apps that used your Gmail login,
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.280]   nobody was willing to give it up.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.800]   Are there apps that did this?
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.960]   - Oh yeah, there's lots of apps.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.200]   - Really?
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.040]   - Yeah.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.080]   - Give me your Gmail.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.400]   - Well, the Gmail Drive is kind of one of the few
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.960]   that I remember, you know, featuring on Life Hacker
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.440]   and being like, this is just a brilliant idea.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.320]   It's totally not something that Google would approve of.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.960]   You know, when Gmail first launched and it was like,
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.160]   oh my God, I have gigabytes of space on, you know,
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.560]   in the cloud, which is not a big deal now,
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.000]   but back in the day, it really was.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.280]   So, yeah, this is pre-jockbox era, you know?
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.020]   - A year or two ago, everything would ask for,
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.920]   find your friends.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.760]   Just give us your Google--
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.600]   - Oh, that's true.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.440]   - Oh, you're right, yeah.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.280]   - Like, you're right.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.120]   - Yeah, right.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:12.960]   - You were just looking at it, invite did it,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.120]   everyone did it.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.640]   And then we came up with OAuth,
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.400]   'cause nobody wanted to, well, the geeks didn't want to do it.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.240]   - All right.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.400]   So what other things, what other Google arenas
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.480]   should be using OAuth?
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   What other applications elsewhere should be doing,
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.600]   what this would do?
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.400]   What does it enable?
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.360]   - Well, I guess it's like Flickr, right?
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.440]   Like Flickr's API is very granular.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.960]   You can say what an app can do with,
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.720]   or look at your private Flickr photos.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.360]   Can it post a Flickr or not?
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.400]   And I think Gmail is a kind of weird one.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.760]   And I guess it'll be like,
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.560]   Gina's been saying, like, it'll be kind of like a Google Labs.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.040]   Like anyone can come up with a crazy Gmail hack.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.520]   But I'm more interested in, I don't know,
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.840]   Google Reader being more, like,
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.120]   I could do that in anything.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.000]   I don't know what else.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   I mean, I wish Google Analytics and Google even AdSense,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.160]   like I wish I had remote access to it,
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.200]   or desktop access, or I could have dashboards in my web apps,
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.600]   you know, my private admin panels on my web servers.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.440]   That could be pulling in some information
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.080]   from those through an API.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.200]   I'd be very happy about that.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.760]   - Is this redundant in Facebook?
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.360]   Because of the Facebook platform?
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I guess Facebook Connect
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.160]   is sort of their attempt at,
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.800]   well, they're more about identity.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.600]   And then as you do identity,
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.360]   it also links apps together.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.520]   So they're trying to roll identity and authentication
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.040]   and, you know, application APIs into one thing.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.120]   So when you log into, you know,
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.000]   four square with your Facebook thing,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.040]   it's gonna start posting a Facebook on your behalf.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.680]   Usually by default without telling you
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.200]   when you have to go in and turn it on.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.400]   - It's so annoying.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.080]   - Going over and over.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.480]   I like the way Flickr does it,
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.720]   'cause more developer friendly, it's like,
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.960]   you just gave us access.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.320]   Are you okay with the following four things?
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.520]   You know, listed, very, it's kind of a pain,
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.800]   you have to go through three or four screens of it.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.200]   Yes, yes, I trust them.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.000]   Yes, go ahead, post.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.720]   But it's better than the Facebook flip side,
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.880]   which is turn everything on by default, you know.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.440]   - And you have to opt out.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.280]   - Yeah.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.120]   - Yeah.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.280]   - Android is similar too, right?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.720]   Like, so when you install an app on Android,
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.520]   you always get that pop up that says,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.920]   this application needs these following rights, you know,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.200]   access to your network, access to your contacts,
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.840]   and then you have to hit okay.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   That's not the case with iPhone apps don't do that, right?
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.240]   Don't give you that sort of breakdown
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.560]   of everything an app requires.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.080]   - No, they just ask for like geolocation
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.280]   is usually the only sort of, you know,
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.120]   oh, and still ask you if you want to be annoyed
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.800]   by the little, you know.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.080]   - Notifications, yeah.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   - Yeah, the notifications.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.400]   But yeah, network access,
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.080]   I always thought that was kind of silly on Android.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.320]   Like it's on the phone, of course, go ahead.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.640]   - It is a long list, which nobody reads.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.160]   And some apps still have pages.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.000]   You read it?
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.520]   - No, but I like that it's there.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.680]   I like that I can pack.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.000]   I mean, something that's streaming video and you're like,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.480]   all right, you know, I want to know whether or not
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.560]   it's going to use, if I didn't have it on the metadata plan,
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.120]   I, you know, I don't know.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.480]   I like the idea that apps are upfront.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.840]   Like I like the idea of knowing.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.680]   - Exactly.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.760]   - It strikes me that Google wouldn't better off
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   if they had put buzz through this OAuth path,
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:27.840]   so that you would have gotten all that stuff.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.240]   If they went ahead and integrated it all too much
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.200]   because it's all Google,
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.440]   but if they'd actually had a separation of buzz
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.360]   and enabled that, we might have,
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.400]   they might have solved some of the problems they've had.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.720]   - Oh, like when you opted into buzz,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.280]   if it said view, okay, we want this.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.640]   - But if you literally need to use OAuth.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.200]   - Here's the list.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.960]   - Yeah, the list of things we're going to do.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.320]   - It really wasn't going to get your password
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.600]   and it really was separate, and here's what's happening.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.280]   It would have been a smarter way to do it.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.120]   - Right.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.520]   - Speaking of which, one story on the feed
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.680]   is that a White House official who left Google,
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:02.360]   his buzz friends revealed that he was communicating
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.080]   with his old Google colleagues
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.760]   in some people's view a little too much.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.600]   - Ooh.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.040]   (laughs)
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:08.880]   - So.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.320]   - Ooh, interesting.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.320]   Very interesting.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.840]   So Howard Stern, apparently, well,
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.400]   I'm sure he doesn't listen to this week in Google.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.400]   Unless he's a listener.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.240]   - A lotta kids.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.080]   - A lot geekier than I thought.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.240]   But of course, you can't mention Howard Stern
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.880]   without 50 listeners sending him clips,
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.040]   hoping that he'll say something about it.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.440]   So we talked last week about the fact
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.400]   that he was still using Lotus notes.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.240]   And--
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.480]   - And I think Gina was actually the meanest
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.480]   making fun of him for it.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.320]   - I was, and you know, I'm so happy
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.560]   that I got to make fun of Howard,
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.280]   'cause I'm not a big Howard fan.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.720]   I just like the idea that I got to bust his chops sort of.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.560]   (laughs)
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.680]   - Well, he has a rationalization.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.280]   - Yeah, here's Howard Stern from the show.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   - I need a keyboard.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.520]   I need it to be with hard keys.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.000]   I hate that keyboard on the iPhone.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.880]   And also, you know, I have Lotus notes.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.360]   It's not, it doesn't work that well on the iPhone.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.560]   And by the way, it was a show the other day
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.960]   that Jeff Jarvis appeared on,
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.040]   where he made fun of me for using Lotus notes.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.480]   He said, boy, Howard's really antiquated for using Lotus.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.760]   Not so he goofed on me.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.720]   The reason I use Lotus notes, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   is because I was told that it is the most secure software.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:23.120]   - Told by his tech guy who was an IBM employee
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.320]   for 17 years, I might add.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.440]   - Right.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.240]   - It's most secure software.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.080]   You never have a company.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.440]   - But I got email from Jeff Schick,
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.080]   who is that guy who's been advising Howard
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.680]   from the beginning, and he's having me in
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.440]   at the end of the month to show all the wonders
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.240]   of how Lotus notes is used by this company.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.240]   - Oh God.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.320]   (laughs)
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.000]   - My worst nightmare.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.680]   - That's all I can do.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.400]   - Better you than us, Jeff.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.800]   - I got to see how Baba Bowie uses Lotus notes.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.640]   - Oh wow.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   Well, having been forced by Ziff Davis
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   to use Lotus notes for 10 years from 1992
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.520]   to actually 1994 to 2004,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.760]   I can tell you, I don't care if it's secure.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.000]   I couldn't care less.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.520]   (laughs)
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   - Yeah, it's so secure that Howard can't access it
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.360]   on his phone.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.400]   You know, I was thinking that I was really mean
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.240]   and I made fun of him.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.640]   And then I was thinking, you know,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.160]   if someone, if an enterprise person,
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.400]   you know, if someone like Howard came to me
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.600]   and said, "I need to know what email software,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.360]   "you know, software or system should I install my company?"
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.080]   I don't even know what I would say.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.360]   - No, what would you tell them?
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.280]   - I mean, what would you tell them?
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   I mean, it's like the choices are like notes, exchange.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.080]   - What are you trying to protect fart jokes?
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.800]   - This is the other thing is like email security.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.200]   Like as soon as you send an email, it's insecure.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.040]   It's a postcard.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.600]   - It's inherently insecure.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.440]   - Right, right.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.880]   So I was like, okay, well, he's concerned
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.720]   about getting his inbox getting hacked.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.320]   Right, I mean, that's the security.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.280]   - I was trying to figure out what he was talking about
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.120]   to be honest.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:45.960]   What's the security?
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.720]   You're not gonna get spam, no.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.520]   Are you not gonna get phishing schemes?
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.760]   No.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.160]   Is your mail somehow magically safe once it emerges
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.040]   from the server? No.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.600]   So I'm not sure exactly what he's talking about.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.080]   - No, I think what he gets is a group sharing
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.920]   of writing and things like that with his crew.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.600]   But you know, these days I tell them to use docs.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   I wouldn't push wave, like yet.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.440]   - No, no, no, Google apps though.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.120]   - Google apps.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.400]   - But there's a guy named John Payton,
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.120]   who now he ran the Spanish language,
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.680]   published, biggest Spanish language publisher in the US.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   He now is heading a new job at a really beaten down
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.120]   newspaper company called General Register
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.280]   and full disclosure on London's board of advisers.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.600]   But as I was at the whiteboard this week with John,
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   it occurred to me that he really could publish
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.200]   the entire newspaper with Google Docs, Google Apps,
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.520]   WordPress and Flickr.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   And it really works, especially if you put the print stuff last.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.080]   The only thing it can't do is fit copy to a page
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.640]   and a layout.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.560]   But if you do that last in the process, everything else,
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.960]   imagine if a newsroom structure were entirely
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.640]   on a blog platform and you do things as a process
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.800]   and you do them in the open and you get people
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.720]   to contribute things to you through Flickr
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.920]   and through the blog.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.480]   And you do collaborative documents through apps.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.120]   It really becomes a new way to publish a new products.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.880]   - Do it, I wanna see this.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.920]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.240]   - Well, do you know, okay, fine, we'll get your advice.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.180]   (laughing)
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.020]   Excellent.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:26.040]   - I signed up for something called Vault Press.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.160]   I'm kind of intrigued by this talking about security.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.440]   It's something from Matt Mullenweg,
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.960]   the guy who created WordPress,
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.280]   who was the original WordPress writer,
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.000]   his company, Automatic, is doing it.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.280]   And I've signed up for beta, haven't heard from the idea,
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.920]   is it secures your WordPress blog
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.600]   and backs up your data somehow magically.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.200]   It's a plugin that will act as a backup service.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.000]   There are WordPress plugins,
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.280]   but it also apparently monitors your site
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.640]   looking for hacking activity.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.320]   And people who, like me, who use WordPress,
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.600]   this is our biggest fear.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.080]   - I think between this and backupify,
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.520]   which we talked about a couple of times in the show,
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.800]   I think I see a real trend here
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.640]   in this notion of security and portability.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.960]   - Yeah.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.320]   - Yeah, it's a good, you need attention.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.000]   - Yeah, it's very good.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.520]   And Matt, you know, Matt created one of the first best
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.600]   comments spam protectors.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.440]   - Yes.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.280]   - Okay, is Matt Mullen?
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.520]   - He is sticking that way for the benefit
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.400]   of the blogosphere.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.560]   - And the hello dolly plugin.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.040]   (laughing)
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.080]   I take a never really understand why it exists.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.120]   - I actually, I have to, I mean, I'm a nerd,
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.960]   so I like, I want to use our sync.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.160]   But I have to, I actually pay for two different
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.240]   web hosting plans so that I can like sync one to the others.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.080]   - What a good idea.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.520]   - So you could fail over.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.360]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.400]   - That's the right way to do it.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.320]   That's a very, very good idea.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.800]   - I'm sure that the WordPress plugin is much easier for,
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.640]   you know, to hook up.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.480]   - Well, maybe not, it's 20 bucks a month, maybe.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.000]   They don't know you.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   - I told them to charge less.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.440]   When they asked me, if you want to be in the beta,
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.280]   they said, how much?
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.920]   I said 10.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.760]   - Five.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.600]   - Five.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.480]   - Matt, what do you do?
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.160]   How do you back up meta filter?
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.760]   - We have two servers, like a web and a database server,
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.880]   and they're copying nightly to each other,
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.040]   and then to a third box that's outside of that.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.000]   And then we also just threw in Dropbox as a fourth.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.080]   - Oh, that's neat.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.320]   - It's the data center burns down.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.640]   You know, we still have a backup of the database.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.480]   - You get it.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.320]   - It doesn't take much to, you know,
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.480]   I've been hacked several times on my WordPress blog.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.000]   It doesn't, it only has to happen once
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.880]   before you start really thinking about cane ways
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.600]   to make sure that never happens again.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.440]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.280]   Mine has to.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.760]   Matt, the entire meta filter database is in Dropbox.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.480]   (laughs)
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.160]   - The nightly backups, I think are 20 or 30 gigabytes.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.520]   And that's like 3 million comments about half a million.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:52.360]   - Wow.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.200]   - Yeah.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.400]   I mean, 20 gigs to me seems huge for a database, but.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.440]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.240]   - It's probably three to four million items.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.880]   - Wow, that's amazing.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   Very cool.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.560]   - That is.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.400]   - Over what period?
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.280]   - 10 years.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.600]   That's 10 years of activity.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.640]   But like if I lost that, I mean, this, the whole thing's dead.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.240]   We actually had a problem with a major database maintenance
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   night, you know, we lost like 24 hours of one site,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.080]   which was bad.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.600]   It was like 1500 comments and like 100 hosts.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.600]   And we rescued as many as we could out of Google cache,
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.560]   but that was like, and then people would email in what they had
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.640]   in their browser cache.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.120]   - Ooh, that's bad.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.000]   - I mean, we had to build tools in a matter of an hour or two
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.920]   that would let us repopulate the database and stuff.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.680]   And we came back with, I don't know,
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.320]   we got about 70% of it back like one days,
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.400]   but to do that for 10 years would be horrible.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.240]   - Yeah.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.360]   - Just seeing all that data.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.840]   - Yeah, you don't wanna do that.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.040]   - It seems like 20 bucks a month seems outrageous,
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:56.880]   just for a blog.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.400]   - It does seem like a lot.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.080]   Unless you're like giga-ohm or something.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.480]   I mean, if you're just a guy with a WordPress blog,
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.200]   I would think five bucks is the most,
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   'cause it's, I imagine you can do an export from WordPress
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.880]   and toss that to Dropbox.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.680]   - I have a plugin that mails my entire database
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.440]   to Gmail every night.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.400]   - Yep, me too.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.240]   I use that one too.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.080]   - Yeah.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.600]   And so now I have it in Gmail and it's, you know,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.920]   it's not that big.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.280]   - Few megabytes, yeah.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.000]   - And periodically I'll go through and delete old versions.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:26.840]   It's really handy.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.160]   It's very easy and that's free.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:35.480]   I'm glad I know them using the same one, Gina is.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.960]   - I'm also our thinking of MySQL DOM.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.720]   So, you know, redundancy.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.560]   - Yeah.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.160]   - Not to be, you know.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.840]   - And what are you doing, Mr. Niena?
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.680]   - So quirky.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.280]   - What are you doing, Niena?
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.320]   - I begged Jake to back up once in a while.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.160]   - Yeah.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.120]   (laughing)
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.280]   - So there you go.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.320]   - Yeah, what else can you do?
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.120]   Exactly.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.360]   - What's your choice?
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.880]   - He rolls his eyes at me the way he did
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.240]   when we went off to the Apple Store.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.080]   - Yeah.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.920]   - Oh, Dad.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.760]   - Yeah.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.640]   - Speaking of cool, Google engineers have recreated Quake 2
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.360]   in HTML5, obviously a demo of what you can do
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.880]   to in performance for HTML5.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.000]   Unless this was in April Fools.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.400]   I don't think it was.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.920]   - I'm so glad that's over.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.000]   - I know I heard April Fools.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   - I hate it.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.560]   - You have to think about everything you read.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.400]   Is this real?
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400]   Could this really be?
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.920]   - And Google now goes all out.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.320]   I mean, they go all out for April Fools.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.160]   - Bro.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.920]   - It really is part of the culture,
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.040]   kind of hacker culture, pranks is like part of it.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.360]   So April Fools is, but they like, I mean, they're a lot.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.440]   - And they do okay, but the problem in general
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.880]   is that you have millions and millions of people
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.720]   who are not funny every other day of the year
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.640]   that you could eat makes them funny.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.520]   - So let's see, to this year they renamed themselves Topeka.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.360]   - That was okay.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.560]   - Oh, that's funny.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.720]   - And a very simple one, is a simple tip of the hat
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.840]   to the fact that the town of Topeka renamed itself
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.320]   to Google, Kansas, trying to get the Google
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.280]   community fiber initiative there.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.480]   A few years ago they did the toilet,
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.280]   internet service provider, a free broadband service,
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.720]   Google TISP, remember that?
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.880]   I think as they do a nice job of the design.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.200]   So you really believe what you're seeing.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.080]   - Better Matt would say than they did with YouTube.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.920]   - Yeah.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.480]   (laughing)
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.680]   - Sign up for a free.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.160]   - It's something about Google's April Fools jokes.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.240]   It's like, there's unfunny on the web
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.920]   and there's like mean and there's line,
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.040]   but then Google, it's like the nerd in the back
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.520]   of the room who, I don't know, is trying really hard,
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.200]   but it's not-- - It's really awkward,
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.280]   it's true. - Yeah, it's just like, oh, yay.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.360]   I mean, my card there, Norbert.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.080]   My biggest problem with April Fools
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.560]   is the believable ones and getting snookered
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.240]   by people you trust, they hate that.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:01.000]   Like I believe that Michael Arrington nuclear power,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.840]   I was like, well, you know, I mean, there's a lot
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.440]   of green people talking about, you know,
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.520]   we kind of have to think of nuclear power again.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.760]   I was like, Google's working on nuclear power,
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.480]   they're working on crazy fusion.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   - They're doing some green stuff, yeah.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.240]   - Yeah, they're trying, and they're trying cold
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.880]   cell oxygen in a magical box.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.920]   Yeah, like fuel cells is what they're into
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.960]   and like, nuclear's, you know?
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.320]   - Why not? - Not the greatest.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.240]   - Yeah, it was like, that's probably true.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.960]   Yeah, it was false, he made it up.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.800]   - I hate that.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.560]   Hate it when that happens.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.640]   So you can go, it's a GWT port of, I like that.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   This is a GWT port of Quake 2.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.400]   Now, easy to install.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.600]   You have to install Aug-Vorbis and lame,
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.680]   that's for the audio.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.880]   On Linux, you run pseudo apt to get
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.400]   installed Vorbis tools, you know, you just use apt to get
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.320]   or Mac ports on the Mac.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.800]   Then you build the server, install the resources,
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.320]   and then navigate to localhost8080 and your GWT Quake.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.440]   And there you go, you got a Quake server running.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.160]   Have you done this yet, Gina?
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.960]   - I have not.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.800]   - It's really tempting.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.400]   - I'm realizing how the instructions to my software
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.760]   looks to regular power.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.400]   (laughing)
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.040]   - So I installed GgV, right?
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.480]   Like, I always hate it when I end up on GitHub.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.320]   - Yeah.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.320]   - It's like no problem.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.080]   - Hey everyone wants ice cream?
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.240]   Everyone wants ice cream, right?
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.000]   - Here, there's some salt, some ice.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.200]   - Easy, anybody can do this.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.760]   - In three hours you'll have ice cream.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.160]   (laughing)
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.800]   - Oh dear.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.880]   - I have quoted that line because you're absolutely right.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.120]   I'm working on making the installation easier.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.240]   In the meantime, I'll install Quake.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.480]   - Yeah, you're better.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.760]   I don't think you need, hey, you don't even need to have
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.640]   SVN or get installed.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.520]   This is just a simple apt get.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.160]   No problem.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.000]   - No problem.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.320]   - No problem.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.520]   Let's see, what other stories are we working this week?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   - Well, I got a few of fun ones.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.960]   The Germans go nutty on privacy
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.920]   and somebody sabotaged the street view truck there.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.560]   - No, they sabotaged it, how sad.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.000]   - Me was, it's good trouble.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.160]   There's an Australian minister, communications minister,
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.000]   who went ballistic on Google, on radio this last week.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.320]   Really kind of wacky.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.520]   And what of his complaints was that
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.080]   Eric Schmidt told Wall Street analysts,
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.680]   "We love cash."
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.720]   What's wrong with that?
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.760]   - Shocking.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.600]   - Shocking.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.320]   - It's very frightening what's going on in Australia.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.440]   It's almost as frightening as China.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.240]   Australia wants to basically put a rating system
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.440]   and filter all web content and force it to happen.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.680]   And it's getting wacky there.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.520]   - Right.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.640]   - He says, "Google's doing more filtering than we're doing."
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.280]   Says, "So when people say shouldn't we just leave it up
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.960]   "to the Googles of this world to determine
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.400]   "what the filtering policy should be?
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.120]   "Make no mistake, anybody who wants to go
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.440]   "on to Google's sites now and look up their filtering policy,
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.160]   "this guy's just making this stuff up."
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.000]   - He's wacky.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.960]   - Well actually, they filter more material
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.000]   on a broader range of topics
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.280]   than we are proposing to put forward.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.360]   Oh, they're just nuts.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.680]   Google in fact said that we're not gonna voluntarily
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.760]   comply with the Australian government.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   - But you gotta stop going on all over.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.320]   You got the digital Millennium Act.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.480]   I mean, you got stuff Kevin Marks talked about last week
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.800]   in the UK, Digital Britain.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.640]   - You got this in Australia.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.160]   You obviously have China going on.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.800]   It's frightening stuff for the internet, I think,
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.640]   at some point.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.680]   - It's gonna be very hard for Zarda Fender.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.720]   - Yeah, it's gonna be very, well they did cave
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.920]   eventually to the Australia.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.240]   - Well, Google did sign up this week
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.440]   for Digital Do Process, which is a group
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.800]   of a bunch of companies trying to,
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.280]   at digitaldooprocess.org,
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.720]   trying to guarantee our rights better on the internet
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.840]   in terms of better protection of our stored data,
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.320]   better protection of our location privacy,
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.920]   better monitoring against people who would,
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.440]   better protection against monitoring of what we do,
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.280]   and better protection against bulk data requests.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.800]   And I think it's important a work
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.720]   and it was just formed this last week
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.480]   with a bunch of people including AOL,
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.760]   ACLU, AT&T, and others.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.440]   - Well, I'll tell you what, I think that pretty much
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.400]   covers what's going on.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.640]   I wanna go back to my iPad.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   So let's get our,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.840]   (laughing)
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.640]   our tip number and tool of the week
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.480]   and we can wrap this.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.680]   - It's like Christmas morning, Halleo.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.920]   - It is, it's so hard.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.160]   You're making me breakfast
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.120]   and I just wanna go to the tree.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.200]   (laughing)
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.360]   Man, this is hard.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.480]   Gina, Gina Trapon,
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.840]   do you have a tip of the week this week?
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.640]   - My tip of the week is for all of you people
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.800]   who didn't get an iPad,
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.640]   who are interested to know what Gmail
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.800]   and the rest of the apps look like.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.360]   If you wanna check it out in your browser,
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.520]   you can do so.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.520]   I'm using this Firefox extension
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.640]   called User Agent Switcher,
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.480]   where you can, I mean,
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.920]   this isn't gonna be any really new news
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.800]   to our listeners, our text-heavy listeners.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.440]   If you use User Agent Switcher,
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.320]   you can enter an iPad user agent
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.760]   and it makes your browser look as if it's an iPad.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.720]   So then you can visit Gmail and other apps
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.920]   and see what the interface is like for the iPad,
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.520]   even without having one.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.440]   So, and the link for the,
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.840]   you need a string to describe the User Agent.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.600]   It's in the story linked on the front feed.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.440]   - Yeah.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.000]   It's very, so what is the User Agent for the iPad?
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.720]   Is it Safari iPad or?
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.440]   - It is Mozilla/5.0 iPad,
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.720]   you CPU, iPhone OS, 3, 2, like Mac OS X.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.560]   - What is it?
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.120]   What is it? - Apple WebKit.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.480]   - What is that Mozilla in there?
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.920]   I don't understand.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.080]   - And then it says Apple WebKit, 531,
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.880]   a couple of version numbers.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.680]   K, HTML, like Echo.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.440]   Yeah, it's long.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.720]   I'm not sure why Mozilla is in there.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.200]   I wonder if Mozilla's in there for the iPhone, let me see.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.360]   - Thank you, a lot of User Agent strings have Mozilla in it,
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.160]   but there's no Mozilla in Safari.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.800]   That's the thing, it's what it's like.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.640]   - Yeah, no, there isn't.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.360]   Yeah, the iPhone 3.0 User Agent also starts with Mozilla.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.400]   So, I'm not sure.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.160]   A question maybe for the chat room or for next week.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.520]   - Somebody should tell us.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.760]   - Our number of the week, Mr. Jeff Jones.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.440]   - Let me look at the latest number here right now.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.080]   4,150.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.880]   - 4,150. - 4,150.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.960]   - 1,150.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.040]   I wonder why Karnak, 4,150.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.920]   - 1,150.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.160]   - I put my iPad against my head.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.680]   I mean, the original Karnak.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.160]   (laughing)
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.360]   Of course, Karnak has referenced,
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   won't mean anything to 95% of the space.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.840]   - Oh, isn't that sad?
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.880]   Only the old folks know that one.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.360]   - 4, there was a Jay Leno, I know.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.520]   So 4,150 is the number of related articles
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.120]   on Google News today about the iPad.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.280]   - Wow.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.480]   - And it does strike me, there's a serious point here,
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.720]   is that that's what's wrong with the architecture of news.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.520]   And that's not even blog posts, that's just articles.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.880]   It means that there's a lot of people
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.160]   who are rewriting the same stuff over and over and over again,
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.440]   and we can't afford that anymore.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.640]   And it's this magnificent hype.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.480]   Of course, I waited just an hour after the line was gone.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.440]   I went in and bought the thing.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.280]   We, you know, fine.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.320]   So we over did the Apple hype.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.600]   But it also says the architecture of the news business,
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.440]   the ecosystem is wildly wasteful,
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.160]   filled with ego and repetition.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.000]   So that's my happy moment for the day.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.640]   (laughing)
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.800]   - Well, that's, but news has always been that way.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.120]   Isn't it a pack mentality?
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.360]   - Yeah, get afforded anymore.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.760]   - Yeah, maybe, well, we don't need to do it anymore.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.600]   - No.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.440]   - Do what you do best, link to the rest.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.880]   I don't really have a tool, my tool is gonna be the iPad,
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.200]   but it has nothing to do with Google.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.040]   So.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:36.880]   (laughing)
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.520]   - And just all I'm going to play with
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520]   for the rest of my evening.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.360]   - I'll confess.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.600]   - Does Google have any iPad apps that are like notable
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.920]   or that aren't available on Android or the iPhone already?
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.840]   - No, not that I know of, no.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.880]   Although I was just playing with Google Earth, it works,
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.800]   but it doesn't scare, you know,
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.000]   they don't have an iPad specific version of it.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.920]   Gmail is the only thing that they,
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.880]   the only nod at all to the existence of the iPad.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.080]   - The web app.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.680]   - That's the one that I did take my iPad
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.840]   to the bathroom already.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.680]   - Yes.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.800]   - You?
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.520]   - Not yet, I just got it.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.720]   - Are you taking it to bed tonight?
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.320]   - I'm definitely taking it to bed, I warn my wife.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.160]   (laughing)
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.000]   - Oh man.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.320]   - Honey.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.160]   - Oh man.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.000]   - What about you?
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.200]   Any personal confessions here for your iPad relationship?
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.800]   - I think it will be unfortunately
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.040]   the best bathroom reader on the planet.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.240]   (laughing)
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.960]   Two months information, but man.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.360]   - Oh dear.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.320]   - I think I need to build a new little shelf just,
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.160]   you know, you need to build a dock.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.480]   That's the real key to do.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.320]   - Oh yeah.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.640]   - A dock into the wall.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.800]   - To hold your iPad.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.640]   - That's the bad.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.800]   - And the other thing I wonder is,
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.840]   I'm not sure yet whether,
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.680]   I read the New York Times on my iPhone on the subway.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.320]   I see other people reading it on the Kindle on the subway.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.920]   Is it too obnoxious to pull out the iPad on the subway?
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.560]   - Wait a couple of weeks and then--
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.760]   - Yeah, give it a few weeks.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.960]   - But you know everybody will.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.800]   You just want to let somebody spot it,
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.520]   spot somebody else doing it first.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.320]   - It's like a floating your bling.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.640]   - Yeah, you know, or you could just get a cover
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.840]   that really is, you know, kind of surreptitious,
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.000]   looks just like it's a notebook.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.280]   Put it inside a newspaper, something like that.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.960]   (laughing)
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.800]   - I'll say I like that play.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.600]   I'll put it inside Time Magazine.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.600]   - Time Magazine, they'll never know.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.640]   (laughing)
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.480]   They'll never know.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.960]   - I mean the new business model from New York Times.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.040]   - The more thing the reference earlier
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.440]   to the Yahoo research scientist who did great work
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.000]   on looking at Twitter and Biltley Stats
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.160]   to look at influence is Dunkin' Watts.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.400]   - Dunkin' Watts, there you go.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   - What are we gonna put it where we're at?
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.240]   - Where we're at?
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.600]   - Credit's in Dunkin'.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.000]   Well, it was a fun time Matt.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.360]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.320]   I know you probably had other things you could do
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.280]   like play with your iPad.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.720]   (laughing)
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.560]   - Thanks for having me, man.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.400]   - We really appreciate it.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.560]   Go to Metafilter to see the 30 gigabyte database
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.080]   of amazing things that have been collected
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.680]   over the last decade at Metafilter.com.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.520]   Really is a wonderful site.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.360]   I must visit.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.840]   It's what the web was made to do.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.640]   Jeff Jarvis is the author of,
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.240]   What Would Google Do?
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.080]   That's his book, Not Yet Available
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.240]   in the iBook Store any day now.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.080]   - Check that out.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.920]   - So Gina, I gotta ask you,
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.240]   after this last hour,
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.520]   did it change your odds at all of getting it?
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.920]   - No, I'm holding out.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.920]   I'm gonna wait.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.760]   - You're tough.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.600]   - I'm gonna wait.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.440]   - I'm so hungry.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.240]   - That's interesting.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.600]   - That's interesting.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.440]   - Wow.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.280]   - Very interesting.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.120]   Jeff's about--
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.040]   - You know, I'm a sock for geek.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.280]   I'm not so much of a hardware geek.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.920]   I will go to the Apple Store and check it out,
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.120]   but I'm not convinced yet.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.920]   - Well, you're tough.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.000]   - I appreciate all of you though,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   figuring out all the stuff.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.880]   - You own a Kindle though.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.280]   This is like a thousand times better than a Kindle.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.120]   - I do.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.360]   Well, this is the deal I made myself.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.360]   I'm gonna sell the Kindle and the iPod touch,
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.560]   and then I'm gonna get a tablet,
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.720]   and it could be the iPad.
