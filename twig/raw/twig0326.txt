[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.720]   Hi Gina
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.160]   Good to see you getting ready for winner number two in New York
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.760]   This one's gonna be better Leo. This is what I'm telling myself. Good be any worse
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   It's gonna be better a little more used to it a little more prepared. I'm ready. I'm stealing myself
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.160]   Holy cow
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   And I'm thrilled we had him in the chatroom
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   I think a couple of weeks ago, and I said is that is that Chris Michael get him on the show Chris Michael drove up
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.720]   He is now a venture capitalist an angel investor with nautilus ventures
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.920]   A photographer in fact I see you brought a pretty nice camera a couple of pretty nice cameras along with you
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   But it's really appropriate that you're here on Veterans Day because we met because you founded military.com a website very early website
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.600]   For the military we used to talk to you all the time on the news on the old screen savers loved it
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.800]   Yeah, 1999 did you sell it? I did to monster to monster remember that company. Are they still running it?
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   They are still around good 16 years. That's great
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.980]   And of course you were in the military yourself. Tell us about your service
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.440]   I flew p3 Orion sub hunters as an avigator and mission commander
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.000]   Cool seven years loved it worked in the Pentagon and we'll want to have to in the Navy the Air Force Navy you were naval aviator
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.320]   I naval flight officer flight up like goose in Maverick except. Yeah
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.560]   Anyway, it's really great to have Chris here
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.840]   We were just looking a little bit at the veterans the little tiny
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.280]   But I think still pretty moving veterans day parade we have near betaluma and we get the vets from you know going all the way back to
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.200]   WW2 and you have a lot of Coast Guard here
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.160]   I saw a lot of coast because there's a coast guard space nearby and so we get a lot of coasties and it's fun
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.040]   It's really it's a nice time of year and it's a great parade
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   But I think it's also I'm really thrilled that we can have you here to to
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.120]   Remember the men and women who served in the armed forces the United States. I'm psyched you bigger. I love this office. It's amazing. Is it great?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.120]   Yeah, it's incredible. Nice. I'm so excited to be here with Gina. I've been a fanboy forever. So she's the great
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360]   She's the greatest. She's the great. That's why I'm actually here
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.240]   Just as we begin where should people go if they want to see your photography because Chris is doing such great stuff
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.120]   Portraiture primarily although I mean your travel photos are amazing too
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.320]   So I just did a piece for outside magazine on the North Pole, which was pretty interesting
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.280]   But if you go to my name Christopher Michael
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.760]   My chgl comm you can see some of the photos or I post them on Twitter and yeah, I follow you on Instagram
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.320]   I see a lot of stuff on Instagram great portraiture. Yeah, that was my net geo picture
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.400]   That's the penguin jumping out of the water kind of near the the South Pole and that's a classic huh and
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.720]   By the way is that you in a flight suit there? Are you is that you in a you two it is? Yeah, that's that's
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.420]   That ass photo. Yeah, I'm basically like an astronaut
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:13.920]   You do do great astronaut pictures. Thank you. Yeah, I think you were you into photography back in the military calm days or is it just a little bit but
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.520]   After my second company said what is it? I really want to do and it's all stories with photos and it's really fun
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.280]   Isn't there's a problem with the you two flight though is it was a one-off thing
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.760]   So after my week of training and my flight up to the edge of space
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.400]   I realized that that might have been the greatest moment of my life and it was all downhill rat you know how buzz Aldrin felt
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.200]   It's tricky. That's it, baby. You're done now. Oh
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.480]   That is that is pretty cool. That's how it looks a little afraid though. I'm a little worried for you
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.600]   The space suit helps a lot makes everyone look epic. Yeah, you could probably get your ride. What yeah, really? Yeah, maybe I
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.860]   You know, we've had really possibly have a fan as a YouTube pilot. He was here
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.100]   We were talking that is a very tough assignment. You spend how long in that plane when you're on well
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.120]   They can spend like ten hours and it is and they're alone physically demanding. Yeah, cuz you're you're practically at the edge of the atmosphere
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.480]   This is me doing weightless training at the at Star City in Moscow
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.600]   So I went and did a shoot for Yahoo around one of the launches and I got to do some fun space training was pretty fun
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.860]   You're getting to live the the dream now
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.780]   Well, it's interesting
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.880]   You know, is it about the pictures or the experiences the camera brings you and sometimes it's about the experiences, you know
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.000]   And the photos are a byproduct. Yeah, I just use it as excuse to travel first
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.780]   If I were this good, I might take more may take it more seriously
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.720]   I'm usually taking more from all these interesting people here. Yeah, you know, that's one of the things you've been doing which I love is taking
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   beautiful black and white portraits of
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.480]   startups
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.320]   Startup founders in San Francisco. You kind of hang out at a blue bottle and just and just wait a little little
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.340]   Well, it's funny
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.320]   I go to board meetings and I'm the only person that in the heat of the moment of the most difficult like conversation
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.200]   I pull out my camera and take a few photos
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.600]   But you know the funny thing is we don't remember well
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.840]   We don't also don't remember those conversations because they go pie and right ten years later. What do you remember? Maybe somebody took a photo?
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.360]   Yeah
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   Really awesome. What's your preferred distribution?
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.720]   Method for your photos. This is your personal site that Leo's looking at. Yeah, it's my personal site
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.480]   So I mean I use I have a blog explorers calm and I tweet stuff. I put stuff up on smug mug flicker
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.560]   I'm liking the new Google photos. Really? Oh, yeah
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.360]   It's a you know, Bradley Horowitz was at the lobby and we've been talking for a long time
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   So I had like I don't know 1.8 million people following me on Google+ and it just wasn't working
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.280]   You know, you'd post a photo and you get all these people comment
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.080]   You didn't know them and I just knew there was a problem and you know, that's not Google's strength is social
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.100]   There's strength is sort of utility. So I think there is a bigger opportunity
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.680]   But honestly, I'm generally worried about all of our digital photos because you know if
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.760]   Flicker or Microsoft or even Google decides they don't want to give you that storage or something happens to these companies
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.080]   That would never happen. Why would somebody like Microsoft just turn off your storage? Well, you can count on them forever
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.880]   But I mean we could lose the photos, you know, it's a problem
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.280]   That's why I store them on all I do I use I use drop bucks. Yeah one drive Google photos
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.660]   Flicker and Amazon has a free upload service, too
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.080]   So I put them on all of my figure they're not gonna all go it's not bad at the same time. I have an opportunity
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.260]   Yeah, you're probably right. I probably once you do a book, you know blur book print a book print a book
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.000]   That's probably the safest way that's gonna last especially if they use good paper, right?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.880]   And you keep it and you store it well, it's kind of funny through all this technology what we're trying to do on this paper
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.280]   Oh, this is one of my I love this picture here. Oh, that was from
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.680]   These are we these are amazing. Yeah, I saw this in your Instagram Wow
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.120]   Yeah, I just want to set my Chromecast background to your photo
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.680]   I agree
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.960]   Gosh, these are really gorgeous
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   Well, I hope both of you are taking a lot of photos because you know you meet all these interesting people and there's an opportunity
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   We should meet Gina
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.920]   Yeah, it's true. Yeah, some stories. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:11.120]   Speaking of Google plus Vic Gundro tris found a job. Thank goodness. He's gainfully employed once again
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.400]   Remember Vic was the guy who pretty much put Google plus on the map
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.080]   Tells me his job search wasn't too onerous for him. I wasn't really looking
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.940]   But along comes a very interesting startup that allows you to do an E
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.000]   EKG on your smartphone and
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.600]   He's now the as of today the CEO
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.840]   But you I think you're exactly right
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:47.040]   He probably didn't need the job in fact if you look at this picture of Vic from recode it looks like he's on the beach
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:55.200]   By the way, I'm sorry if you're helicopters and planes going over the veterans days. There's some really cool sunglasses. He has yeah
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.400]   Yeah, I think there's Chanel. Yeah
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.920]   Vic has joined a live core
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   And this is one of the few
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.000]   Devices that has gone through the expense and trouble of FDA approval
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.280]   So it can do a full ECG. I always call the EKG
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.960]   I'm not sure if there's a difference that you get you get these
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.600]   Which I I gather you probably put on your chest
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   and EKG requires
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.320]   More than two electrodes, but maybe this is enough for them to do what they do kind of jumpstart you
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.880]   It looks like paddles. It does look it does look like it might be a defibrillator as well
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.520]   That's that's what you want to happen in the board meetings. Well, I just different rate myself
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   Yeah, who do you give the control to?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:49.680]   He said, you know, he was seven people don't remember he's 15 years at Microsoft then seven years at Google
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.000]   The story goes he he just badgered Larry Page until Larry said all right all right. We'll do social
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.200]   Google plus and then once Larry kind of moved upstairs to alphabet there was actually even before then once Larry kind of
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.160]   With through his patreon she was not much more for fit to do and he left
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.800]   In April of 2014 apparently Veenaut Koshla
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.080]   persuaded him
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.160]   to join the the team he would notice a well-known VC and
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.720]   He he has a stake in a life core a live core
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.160]   He's a CEO
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.040]   Bix the new CEO. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, you say probably not too on our so-good job search. Yeah
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.920]   On yes wandering around looking for things to do
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:43.120]   I get the new iPad pro we were talking about this before the show. I guess I should show this I haven't done
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.660]   I just got it this morning Apple put it on sale at
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.760]   Shortly after midnight this morning Pacific time
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.640]   And you know what gang it's a giant iPad
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.360]   That's what it is now. I've attached it to this is interesting Apple selling the keyboard that they mentioned
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.320]   When they did the the reveal but I decided not to get the Apple keyboard. It was a hundred sixty nine dollars
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   And Apple's also selling at the same time the Logitech creative keyboard for 20 bucks
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.160]   Has Logitech branding on it. Yeah, it's well
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:25.880]   It's a lot it's not an Apple product but Apple selling it at the Apple stores 20 bucks less and unlike the let me unlock this here
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.360]   unlike the
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.740]   Which finger did I I've just been setting this up unlike the Apple keyboard it has dedicated keys?
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:40.000]   for the iPad which is oddly something there's the lock key it's oddly something that the
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.800]   The Apple keyboard itself does not have this finger
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.360]   This has a lot of built-in keys just go to home screens search switch tab
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:59.200]   It's enormous. It is a giant. Yeah, let's talk about the iPad enough about the keyboard actually when you so you were smart because you brought a
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.120]   Nice small Mac book along with you Christopher you could fit like three of those inside of that one
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.680]   Maybe it could be a carrying case for the Mac for a little more expensive not much
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.400]   I bet it's not no actually this was nine hundred forty nine dollars for the one hundred twenty eight gig
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   plus
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   150 for the keyboard
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.280]   So roughly it's maybe a hundred bucks less than than the starting
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.320]   I mean, it's a cool device if you can forgive them for the charging port. It's heavy
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.960]   Much heavier than the Mac book and Apple's really trying to sell the new iPad
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.360]   Pro as a replacement for laptops Tim Cook told the telegraph
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.480]   Earlier this week. Oh, you don't you don't need a laptop anymore. You've got this
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.560]   I do everything on my Apple watch. I mean, it's basically a desktop replacement. Of course
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.380]   I just I have a Bluetooth keyboard for my
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:56.520]   I don't I don't I don't know really the reviews. They started to coming out last night
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:02.200]   Most people including Walt Mossberg and others said hey it's neat technology, but no it can't replace a laptop
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:08.360]   It's just a giant iPad Microsoft though. We were talking to windows weekly earlier today
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.360]   The whole office is on here. So obviously Microsoft thinks this is an opportunity or
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.640]   Somebody a Microsoft can use it as a phone
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.480]   No
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:27.000]   Please people people I beg of you do not take this to concerts. Yeah as a camera
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.320]   It's the I don't want to see people. Oh, that's great. Look at that. Look at that shot. That's terrible
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.320]   I don't want to see people doing that
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.600]   The thing that was most intriguing to me about the pro is the pen which isn't out yet. Yeah, that's also another thing
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.000]   Thank you Apple. You've been the pen is of course the most interesting part of this won't be out for a month
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.800]   A month so December December 7th they said a day that will live in infamy
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:04.080]   So I mean it feels like this is this like other this like light computing kind of category like where the surface it is and maybe even the chrome book
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.080]   This idea that there's like a cell be kind of a laptop, but not really
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:17.160]   That's a great. Yeah, I don't know. It's a high see I think if Apple was smart with
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.720]   I think if Apple was
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.080]   If Apple was skills man
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:29.720]   If Apple was smart, that's what they would say is this is a unique category because otherwise what happens is people go
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.400]   Well, wait a minute. How is this different from the surface pro and I think the surface pro is better because it's a full operating system
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:42.800]   I just I feel like this is not this is an interesting product, but I
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.200]   Know it remains to be seen whether it's gonna be
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:53.680]   Reinvent the world and and that's what Apple should be saying is this is a unique product not it's gonna replace your life
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.000]   I'm thumbs down right right. You haven't even held I don't need to handle it. I've seen everything I need to see
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   It's a great photo
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:10.040]   Can you window apps can you run app side by side on yeah, you can affect let me let me let me let me do that so
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:16.360]   Pro only or is that for it's iOS 9 can do it on on even on your on your phone
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.880]   I don't know if you'd really want to on a small screen, but let me see you could slide this over see I
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.400]   said
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:31.520]   There is a long way to go and for some reason I have no idea why I'm seeing unplayed episodes of
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.760]   Twit on here, but apparently that's what Apple thinks I want to do
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.520]   And then you can I think you can change that's the greatest photo of all time
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:47.240]   I'm not an expert on this so but yeah, the idea is you could you can't have half and half somehow
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.160]   I don't I haven't I just got it. So I don't I don't really know. That's the notification bar
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.000]   This is all the second you're gonna cut me out of your Facebook profile picture. I know that's just another photo. No, that's just another photo
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:08.440]   It is a beautiful scram a resolution wise it's a gorgeous high res screen, but you know I we shouldn't knock anybody who
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:15.520]   Wants to innovate in this space, right? I mean why not that's great. Let me look okay
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.600]   I'll tell you what I'll open I've got inbox open now
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.200]   If I look can I slide that we expect a little more from Apple though seems a bit linear
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.680]   Just harder
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.400]   harder yeah, I don't know I
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   I'm doing something wrong. This is not a review right
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.880]   This is just I got it. I haven't had a chance to play with it
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.900]   I do have to say this key if you're gonna get a case a keyboard. I guess this is a good idea
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.880]   Although it makes the thing damn bulky and very heavy and it keeps turning my
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:01.640]   Dollars down the tubes I
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:10.920]   Will I will learn and I will show at a later date. I haven't had a chance to do to do anything
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.680]   with that
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.760]   Google has acquired a new company called fly labs speaking of Google photos
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.520]   This is actually in fact. I have this on the iPad a really nice little video editor
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.440]   That's very easy
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.320]   That's really loud isn't it
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:42.440]   Staff members you can still buy you're actually download fly
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:52.080]   It's really kind of a cool editing app that lets you very simply create multi camera edits you can have picture in picture you can have
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.400]   Sorry inspiration videos not available. Okay. There's flaw number one
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.600]   Because of the acquisition I think fly labs is starting to take assets offline
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.560]   So if you want to get the fly labs at you might want to quickly get it
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.840]   All the plugins are free for the time being the clips video editor the tempo video editor and crops on the fly
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.400]   Those three add ins used to be paid add ins
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.600]   But it's a nice little video editor. It's interesting that they acquired this. I would imagine
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.760]   What that they will
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:30.200]   They say that they're gonna continue to make these apps available all for iOS for the next three months
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.560]   And you'll be able to continue to use them, but there won't be any more updates
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.200]   I'm impressed by the app. I had never heard of it until I till Google announced that they had a question though
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.000]   Are they gonna port over the features that they just want the team? That's always the question
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.920]   The team is good I would love to see Google does Google have any video editing shops?
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.480]   No, they got they have pretty good photo editing capabilities built into Google photos
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.520]   So it wouldn't this be smart to have a nice clean simple video editor
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.920]   Seems like it especially one that could take stills and videos
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.080]   Mix them you can add music to it and all of that
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.200]   So three more months if if you want to get it. It's a iOS product. I think it's great
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.280]   And I think it makes sense for Google photos to have a video editor. So I hope they keep the product alive
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.680]   Let's see are you using Google photos
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.920]   Yeah, I love it
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.840]   I'm actually surprised to hear you that you use it because I don't see it as a pro product
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.400]   I see it is very consumer focused product. Well, I'm back to your point
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.640]   I mean I I want to have like a multi-modal backup system because I'm worried about everything
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.680]   So this thing just operates in the background and right now I'm fine
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.960]   I mean I have I don't know a million photographs
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.920]   It's taking forever to get up there, which is one of their problems
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.560]   But one of the great things is they're doing a lot of sort of image analysis. So I can I do love that
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.360]   Yeah, so I can sort I can find your photos
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.240]   I can look back and you know you could see where this is going this this is playing to their strength
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.440]   So I think they will probably be the best online catalog available and you know, it's just it's free
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:09.320]   I don't I don't I don't send them up to you. You don't do the high-res so you do the free you have unlimited free
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.800]   low res images, right
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:18.560]   And it'll cost me a lot to do the high-res. Yeah, I'm using smug mug, which I love so which costs you 140 bucks a year
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.080]   So I'm like that's incredible. I love smug mug - I
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.400]   But smug mug doesn't have any of his back-end stuff and that is really
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.800]   Intense interesting to be able to tie them together and that you know that would actually be possible for a third party to do that
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.280]   Which is you know you do all the analysis on Google and then it finds you the most appropriate
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.200]   Right file right
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:46.280]   Yeah, but I think the categorization is interesting. You know what would be really great is
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:53.800]   If you could keep the raw original photos on a hard drive and somehow have them be linked to the Google online
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.000]   Thumb name and treat that as a way to find
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.880]   You're on the big idea the big idea is they're the catalog and it points to the original file wherever it is
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.000]   Right exactly it tells you it's also on Flickr or somebody else's mug mug
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.680]   Yeah, or anyone else who's picked it up it could even do that couldn't say hey by the way, you know that that picture is being stolen
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.800]   Or it's being used under creative comments, right? Yeah. Yeah, I use that on Flickr. Yeah. Yeah
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.080]   Creative comments I do
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.160]   Wow, wow, that's that's because you don't have to make a living. I don't
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.920]   You know I have this debate all the time with professional photographers
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.720]   Which you know a lot of pros hate the idea that if they put an image on the internet they lose control of it forever and
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.880]   They said but no, I mean this is how I make this is my product is how I make a living and I'm of the opinion that
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.760]   Whether you're a musician or a photographer or a writer
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:55.240]   It's not a bad thing to put your stuff out there. You have to find a way to monetize and some people still pay for a lot of the images
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.960]   But I could available and you know the main reason I make it available is for Wikipedia
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.320]   So my photos are many many of the Wikipedia pages
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.240]   Yeah
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   And people get in touch with me and they say they want the original image or whatever and then that there's an opportunity there
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.880]   But I make stuff pretty available and don't freak out about you don't worry about it. No, yeah
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   Trade is a citre rec lift is the same thing. I feel good about it more people use the photo. The better makes me feel yeah
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.880]   Gee know you've always been all about that. You don't hold hold back stuff
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.000]   Yeah, I mean, you know, but I'm go both ways
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.360]   I mean I thought about it mostly in terms of writing
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.480]   You know I've been approached by lots of websites that asked me to contribute and you know get paid in distribution
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.960]   You know that's a battle that that rages on I think people should get paid for that work
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:46.200]   But I also believe that you know it also makes me feel good when I have the chance to to you know reach people that I might not have
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.360]   reached otherwise
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.440]   So it's it's tricky business, but I tend to err on the side of generosity generosity
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.640]   I try to open source on my code when I can and
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.240]   It's usually paid back
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:04.080]   You know down the road and in lots of other ways that I didn't necessarily expect I just read an article
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.720]   Who was that that was complaining that the having paid written an article and maybe it was on
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.600]   Post is one of the examples and they said hey, we'll publish it how much oh nothing
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.760]   You should be happy. We're giving you the distribution. Yeah, like like you like you thank us for offering
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.720]   Yeah, that's not cool. Yeah, you know like
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.880]   Well, you know, I shouldn't say that because I'm not paying you to be here Christopher. You're not
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.840]   A lot of our don't try to give me that iPad
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.360]   a lot of our
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.440]   People who come on a come on for the publicity or for the fun
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.200]   I think you're not here publicity year for fun
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.240]   I want to get the photos and or to take pictures. Yeah, but but uh,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.720]   We pay regular hosts people on our right with paid Gina. We pay people are on a regular basis
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.040]   But a lot of the genius Jean is getting paid
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.120]   What? No, absolutely not
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:01.520]   We're gonna send her a Fez at the end of the year and call it even I get paid empezzes
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   Yeah, sweet. We have a new hat. It's called a chappo. You're gonna love it
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.200]   Um, so but I so I understand that there is not it's not unusual. I have some sort of tit for tat
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.560]   People come on Twitter all the time and don't get paid
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:21.440]   Well CNN has a giant business. I mean, that's talented. Yeah, CNN's not paying contributors and those people are working hard
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   They're showing up at seven in the morning
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.240]   Making stop on air paid by actually, you know what? I did get paid
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.880]   You know pays is live with Regis and Kelly are now Kelly and Michael
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.000]   They but they have to pay cuz after cuz they're not a news operation. Oh, so they pay a union scale
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.160]   Which doesn't cover you than I guess I'll accept their invitations 982 dollars last time I checked something like that
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.680]   But you're right CNN never paid me because they're a news operation and they don't they're not bound by the union rules
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.760]   And so yeah, you show up you put on makeup to get dressed
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.120]   Because it's good PR it's good publicity
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.560]   So I'm not sure that I blame the having a post for trying. I don't blame people for saying no either
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.400]   Well, right. I mean, that's a thing right Leo people say no if they've got you know, they can't do it
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   They say no or or not, you know
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.200]   It's funny
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.240]   It's a sensitive topic
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.760]   I was in Luxor two years ago and a balloon
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.880]   You maybe saw some of this and the balloon next to me blew up and it killed 20 people and I took all the photos
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.160]   And I tweeted it and all of a sudden they wanted the photos for the cover of like every newspaper, right?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.760]   And I was in the middle of this thing and I just didn't feel right about making money
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.920]   And so I said anyone could use the photo for free and I got a lot
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.200]   I mean a lot of people are thank you saying thank you, but a lot of people were saying that's not professional
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   You should have charged. Yeah. Oh
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.520]   Like you write your decision affected other photographers right?
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.880]   You know in the industry of your professional you need to charge because we don't want to start this cycle of people getting content for free
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:58.600]   I'm just glad I do a balloon right over Luxor. I didn't realize that oh, yeah, how's it? It's really hard
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:08.240]   Was that not not a good morning no must have been a horrible thing to see yeah, particularly with a yeah
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   And a tragedy like that yeah
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:17.200]   Are you all gonna run out and get the new togg-hoier Android wear watch I?
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.280]   Don't think on the target audience. There's some really hairy wrists in that
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:31.240]   It's the hairy wrist watch the hairy wrist watch yeah our friend Kevin Rose did a did an article in a review
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.960]   On his he's now a watch guy, you know, he's the CEO of Houdinkey
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:45.240]   What is what is Houdinkey a content Justin is that a comment? Yeah, so what it was it's a was a watch blog that's expanded and now mean
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.240]   You know Kevin told me once I don't think it means anything okay
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.640]   Last URL available. Yeah, yeah all the other names taken basically
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:01.080]   When I looked at the watch, you know, it's bait it is functionally
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.360]   No different than any other Android wear watch that's not surprising because that's how Android wear works
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.880]   But it doesn't even have a heart rate monitor
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.560]   So it's not from functional point of view as good as let's say the new Moto 360
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.900]   Which is one tenth the price or not quite one tenth, but one eighth the price
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.880]   But it is togg-hoier
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.480]   Right and it does have you know a nice titanium case and you know, but but that display
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:32.280]   That's that's the same as any other Android wear watch they come with the this is what Apple does too
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:40.440]   They come Apple with the Hermes Apple watch it's an Apple watch, but it has a different watch face and different band
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:46.920]   Talk who is doing something interesting though. They're offering an upgrade in two years. Oh
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.800]   So into you're purchasing two watches or watch
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.760]   Yeah, well, I don't think it's I have to look and see if it's a free upgrade
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.840]   The watch is 1500 bucks, which is pretty pretty pricey, but not Apple watch pricey
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.320]   I'm looking for more stuff to charge every day. Yeah. Yeah, you should see my bedside table
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.580]   I actually I went on vacation for a couple weeks of San Diego was really great vacation
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.360]   And I brought my Moto 360 which I which I love
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:26.900]   And I just I just didn't put it on one day and I think how I'm on vacation
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.460]   I'm just not gonna and I have it on since like I got home and just didn't put it on
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:37.180]   So I was like, you know, it's just a other thing to charge and the software to update and while like I liked it
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.660]   It wasn't like if I left the house in the morning and forgot it, you know that I would go back
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.780]   You know for my phone
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:48.140]   I would go back and I wouldn't go back for the watch and I finally thought you know all these wires in this plug and this
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.980]   What a charger and the software updates and then it would die and I would get really mad about that because that shouldn't happen
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:30:00.280]   And I found myself like whipped into an angry frenzy about a electric product device dropped to my wrist and I thought this is not
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   Drink some tea Gina. Maybe
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:11.520]   Well, that's fine because that's what Kevin Rose, you know, you'd say Kevin. Well, you know, he's into watches
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.920]   Of course, he's into very expensive, you know mechanical watches
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.200]   But you'd think he might be interested in Andrew where Apple watch and he hated the Apple watch
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.040]   He said that's the last thing I want to do when I go to why dinner with my wife
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.680]   I don't want to be pinged every five seconds by somebody who's sending me a notification
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.560]   I want to focus so the last thing I want to do is have something on my I mean really
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.160]   That's why you get a watch right smart watches for the notifications the health
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.240]   Monitoring things like that. I really like the steps monitoring
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.840]   Yeah, and I like the quick, you know, hey, you know set a timer for this long. I do that a lot
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:52.760]   But yeah, it just wasn't the notifications or a worker of mine got got the Apple watch and he's like talking to him is every three minutes
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.560]   He's yeah, it's just one more thing to pull you out of your reality
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.680]   When you're honestly if you have a phone why do you need it?
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.880]   I mean the phone works so well. It tells time at like if you want to look at notifications
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.040]   You got them. I mean the the a tag-huler deal is
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:14.800]   Get this in two years if you want to upgrade you can pay another fifteen hundred dollars and get a tag-huler
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.360]   Mechanical watch what a deal
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.600]   As you have to wait two years to get a real watch
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.000]   What where is gonna be like how long the upgrades will and then you can upgrade to a mic out?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   It's it's sort of like this path toward
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.400]   Incredible marketing team. Yeah, wow it's weird
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.760]   But you have to think it's somewhat of a response from Tag who were to air mezz which has an Apple watch, right?
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.120]   There's kind of like a race which watch did you get?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.000]   Which which watch would you make?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.280]   Tensor flow
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   This is Google's new
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.160]   Machine learning system and they've open sourced it which I think is really interesting
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:08.560]   So Google has a lot of stuff, you know, they use internally, right software and and so forth. It's a neural network
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.280]   That has been used internally
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.200]   That's the one that you you probably saw the demos of
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.400]   The computer figuring out
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.240]   Where cats were in YouTube videos?
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:32.600]   It's been used to improve speech recognition in the Google app by 25% and the Google Photos image search is based on
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.760]   It this is actually dist belief, which is their internal
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.120]   Project
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:46.280]   So they are now releasing the second generation of dist to believe I should have a better name for Google+
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.200]   Dist belief strange name. It's a strange. Well, yeah, it's an internal
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.720]   So they said we couldn't share this belief because it's so tightly tied to our infrastructure
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.520]   So we are now doing open source release of a second generation system that can be used by others
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.080]   It's flexible general portable easy to use open source. Would you would you I mean?
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.960]   Do you have a need for something like this? I would think think up could probably use
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:16.240]   Something like this, right? Oh, yeah, I looked at this and was like how long would it take me to spin up some AWS since this is running this
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.720]   Just to see just to see what it could learn
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:26.560]   Yeah, I this is something this is very very interesting and really cool really cool that they open sourced it. I mean it I
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.480]   Get that by you know
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:36.760]   Google makes this kind of thing open source so that other people can contribute and run different tests and have different uses and contribute back to it
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:43.880]   But it takes a lot of work to maintain an open source project to decouple it from your insight infrastructure to you know
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.200]   Kind of build up, you know separate modules and make it modular and so it that there's a lot of work that just goes into that
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.440]   So I've been you know sort of continually impressed with Google's
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:34:00.400]   Commitment to that to open sourcing things and you know and I think the idea is that you know
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.960]   Lots of people get the chance to use this and and that it'll improve for everyone which is great for the ecosystem
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.880]   Yeah, but you ultimately to succeed as an open source project you have to get others
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:17.160]   You know committed into it and and and working on it, right? Unless they can plan to keep it going internally
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.760]   Well, I mean, you know plenty of open source projects have a company, you know
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:27.120]   Who are the leaders of that open source? You know Android is is you know from we are you know all those and and so
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.120]   You know you're gonna have the lead committers and the most
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.320]   The most frequent committers are gonna be Googlers and Google is saying that they're committed to running their project
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.120]   So it's so it's unclear, you know how many outside can committers there will be
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.840]   But just the fact that you can watch the work happen in public and and look really into the way that Google gets some of its
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.520]   You know doesn't some of Google's technology is just is great is amazing and helpful for everyone it raises everybody up
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:57.840]   So it's a great thing, you know, it's amazing is also is that AI was a dead was a dead deal 10 years ago, right?
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   Everybody said oh we tried it failed
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.760]   We can't do it
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:08.200]   And now all of a sudden it's the talk of the town they're all networks and this kind of you sent that article ahead of time
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.320]   And I didn't know anything about it. So I talked to my friend
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.240]   Chavon Zillis at Bloomberg beta and she said well, there's nothing that new here
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.480]   She said there's other technologies that do something similar
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.960]   She said I wouldn't underestimate Google's ability to market it and there's actually an article out now
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:28.600]   And it's like get hub rankings. It's like the number of stars and they have like more stars in one day of release than all the
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.520]   Alternatives in you know months, but that's great. That means it a lot. I mean, yeah
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.280]   Okay, so it's not better than anything else out there
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.160]   But it does mean a lot of people will download that could be the big thing
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.720]   It's got a Python interface a lot of people know how to you know would know how to do that
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:46.480]   And I could see somebody like Gina saying well, let's let's apply
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.400]   We have a pretty big data set at think up, right? Let's see what we can do with it
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.200]   Yeah, I mean and this is just the kind of thing that you know
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.360]   University students who wanted a job at Google or was you know taking class in AI would would download and grab you know
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.800]   Data from from various sources and run and come up with some really neat, you know neat information and a cool project
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.440]   So I think I think it's great. I think people of course at Google's ability market is strong
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.760]   I mean that there's you know, there's lots of people who just just by the you know
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.280]   Just because of Google is behind it or will be interested in it
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.920]   8,865 stars in one day
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.640]   I just started
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.080]   I'm logging in so I can start
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.400]   No
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.360]   It is interesting when you see these companies take
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.120]   Kind of leadership and open source. We're I'm on the board of 3d robotics and Chris Anderson's doing drone code
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:47.640]   Which is open source community around drones. It's it's pretty exciting. I mean, you know, they have another advantage when you're leading the coalition
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.120]   You can sort of direct the vector of what people will be doing
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.320]   So it's probably playing into their longer-term interest
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.200]   Then in other words people will contribute back to it make this better and then they could take advantage of that as well
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.560]   Yeah, I think though. I think that's interesting the PR angle really is a big part of this
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.920]   We're we've got the more more scientists smarter people and we're coming up with the latest state-of-the-art stuff
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:18.480]   Who was it that is now? It's in videos now offering a drone module for?
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.000]   Makers
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.040]   It's called the Jetson, which is a I think a good name
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.120]   it is
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   the Jetson TX1
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.760]   GPU module for AI on drones and robots
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.240]   Now it's not cheap. I mean, it's not like Raspberry Pi cheap
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.040]   I think it's almost what was it? I saw the price of that was almost got to be sort of a response 599
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:49.400]   I Qualcomm's putting everything on the chipset snap-trag and they're gonna be basically right basically modern drones are flying cell phones
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.680]   Exactly. Yeah. Yeah
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.760]   So you're right. I think that's exactly right. It's interesting though that they branded as a GPU powered device
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   which is a kind of in
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:10.520]   Opposition to what Qualcomm's doing with arm and a CPU driven product comes with the Linux SDK
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.120]   It's about the size of a credit card
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.960]   It is a
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   Terra flop per second
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.760]   256 core Maxwell based GPU
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.720]   Wow ultimate gaming device
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.800]   Wow
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   the Jetson TX1
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:35.080]   And the developer kit will be 599 to 99 for education customers goes on sale
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:43.600]   Tomorrow and then the modules will be for sale by themselves for 299 early next year just in case you're building a robot
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:49.160]   It is amazing. Isn't it that the I'm blown away by the the fact that
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:55.080]   Since 2007, you know with Apple's iPhone and now Android phones and other smartphones
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.920]   We've kind of mastered manufacturing these systems on a chip. We've become very good at
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.040]   Interfacing them with accelerometers and all sorts of sensors
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.080]   And then that was what fostered the emergence of the quadcopter and and is
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.140]   Another industry has exploded out of it. I imagine robotics will do the same
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.160]   Well, you think about one of the reasons we want kind of the Apple watch to work or the Android watches to work is
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.440]   You know, that's the kind of form factor you want in a drone
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.800]   You want something that small that can fly for a long time. Yeah, a little bitty drone the size of an Apple watch
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.120]   What would you do with that?
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   swallow it
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.800]   That's a spy that's open ROV you're talking some rehearsals. You're talking to spy a spy
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.520]   I don't know. I mean, it's just dust flying in there. It's time and age
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.560]   Smart dust
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.960]   That's kind of terrifying is it
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.360]   well, I
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:55.040]   Guess I don't know you want the you want I mean, I guess if everybody's watching everybody else
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.000]   Then yeah, but it doesn't have to just be about watching well, what else would you use it for?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.300]   Huh singing listening yeah watch and listen together at last
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.280]   Well, you're right. I guess at the end of the day
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.640]   It's monitoring, but I mean you can imagine you're in the city of San Francisco
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.520]   You have a problem and you kind of wave and you got somebody and somebody comes yeah
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:25.320]   Yeah, that's why we're putting cameras up on every intersection. So people will come when you wave. Yeah, that's exactly that's protect
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.160]   exactly the point
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.800]   Love it we're gonna take a break. I'm having fun Christopher Michael is here for Veterans Day
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.640]   We should talk a little bit about Veterans Day and just a little bit he's found her military comm
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.920]   Seven years as a naval navigator flyer
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.440]   Gina Trapani is here as she is of course just Gina Trapani the superhero
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.520]   The woman of my dreams not in the Navy, but not in the Navy not in the Navy, but she's in Brooklyn
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:01.440]   Yeah, yeah, they're naval yards nearby. There's a blue bottle right there. Is there oh, yeah, you don't have to go through withdrawal
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.920]   There's a blue bottle in brook. Oh, I gotta map. Okay, you gotta go
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:12.880]   Really what is all right? Well, that's another I want to talk about that too when we come back
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.760]   Blue bottle I have never had a blue bottle
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.800]   Never never come to San Francisco. We should mention that Christopher is an investor so
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:28.000]   I invested as much as like one latte. Yeah, it's like paying for the whole thing
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.720]   I had dinner with Tony Conrad and that's all he could talk about. He loves blue bottle. He's like a blue bottle
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.600]   With him everywhere he goes
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.600]   He said that he said I'll make you some
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.160]   Said no, that's okay. I don't need any coffee right now

[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.000]   When I was going up to Canada to do a call for help in Toronto
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.120]   And it was such a pain
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.480]   I you know at the end of every month I had a not only they have to invoice them for my time
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:39.640]   But I also had to collect the all the travel receipts and the vouchers and you know
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.320]   It's file exp I we just not do it basically come to the 31st
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.000]   Sure, I wanted the money, but it was like I just can't bring myself to do it
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.520]   Then another month would go by and another month would go by pretty soon. I had like six months of unbuild
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:00.240]   Money do me and that did not work when I sent them that that invoice. They said you can't do that
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.920]   You can't do that you got a bill us every month dude
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.800]   Then Amber told me about fresh books and that changed my life

[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:21.040]   Don't they wear poppies on veterans days and that the thing to do or is that in England in England and Canada they do it too
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:28.920]   Commonwealth because of World War two planners field poppies. I like that though. It's wonderful. I wish we could do that here
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.880]   It's a great tradition. Yeah, and it's really wonderful thing everyone does it. Yeah
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   I'm sure you see it in Canada. Yeah, everybody's wearing a red poppy on their lapel. Usually they're kind of flannel. We were in
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.720]   London last year
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.680]   Just before veterans day or I guess they call it. What do they call it armistice?
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:53.320]   day, but they were putting ceramic poppies a million ceramic poppies around the Tower of London to
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.920]   memorialize all the UK citizens who died in
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.640]   World War two is quite beautiful
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   Remembrance Day. That's what they call it
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.920]   I was in Heathrow Airport and there was an announcement and they said at 12 noon
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.440]   We'll shutting everything at the airport down for two minutes
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.600]   just to
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:18.520]   Remember those who gave I think that wonderful thing. Wow. We were at JFK
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:25.120]   on 9/11 this year and they did the same thing that's all of a sudden they stopped the line at the TSA and
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.320]   everybody gathered and
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.520]   then
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.280]   one of the TSA
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.960]   Officers started seeing God bless America. I could I could I couldn't stop crying
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:42.560]   Yeah, and then they had a moment of silence for because to both the flights to two of the flights took off from JFK
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.240]   So they had a moment of silence for the two flights
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.160]   Boy, it was really it brought it home when you live in New York
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.280]   It's a big it's a whole different experience, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it's a big it's a big deal
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.280]   We we were actually in California this year
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.680]   But um, but yeah that that moment of silence that morning is a it's a big deal. Oh
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:09.560]   Well, let's maybe take a little time today on this Veterans Day Remembrance Day
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.280]   Remember all of those who gave so much
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   All over the world, but certainly here in the United States as well
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.400]   Did blue bottle buy Tonks they did I
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.840]   think they did
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.200]   Tartine Tartine they own Tartine. Yes. Oh
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.520]   Loved I have his cookbook
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.280]   Yeah
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.960]   Tox was an advertiser here. There was a it was a artisanal coffee
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.800]   Every month you'd get or every week you'd get some mailings and a blue bottle bottom last year
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.760]   so
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.720]   I wonder if talks was well loved. Yeah, we love we love that they're a great sponsor
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.760]   Well, James Freeman who's the founder and Brian me and who's my business school classmate?
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:03.240]   Are there they're the two that are really running it and they are incredibly nice carrying people in it to me the exciting thing about blue bottle
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.560]   Molly is a great coffee, but this is the first sort of major effort
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.920]   I've ever seen to kind of scale quality and authenticity, you know, usually when these things get big
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.760]   They become a little like Starbucks or you know, can they do it in a real way where I mean?
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:21.000]   I think the metric is do the people that work at the blue bottles in wherever Tokyo or New York
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.120]   Do they feel special do they feel like they're it's a cool job and right now they do and I I think they're gonna be able to keep that up
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.400]   But it's you know, those people are kind of coffee scientists. They carry notebooks
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.720]   They really love their jobs, and it's so fun talking to them. It's great when you go someplace where people are really proud of what they do
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.040]   you know I
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   Have to say though
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.680]   What a what a great business you're selling an addictive
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.040]   drug
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.840]   Looking for them to be a sponsor. This is working
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.800]   More people drink the more they need
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:58.040]   And they love and you make everybody happy doing it. It's not illegal
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.520]   It seems like just that's like that's like
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.800]   How could you not make money selling coffee?
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.160]   It's a and even people yeah, I talk to people all the time say Duncan donuts coffee, man
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.680]   That's the greatest coffee in the world, right?
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.720]   Yeah, you're right you're right, but I mean to me, you know some people are like I need the coffee and the New York
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.960]   New York is a little bit like this where the people get their coffee and go
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.360]   I need the coffee. Yeah, but in my experience. It's sort of like it's in how we're chill to this
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:28.520]   It's the third place you go there. It's cool people in a cool space. Yeah, you feel like you're part of something neat
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.600]   You know yeah, and it's addictive which is nice and it's a this is nice little side benefit
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   Watch out because here comes bulletproof coffee. You know about yeah, right? What's this guy's name? He's he invented this
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.040]   He's all right. It's coffee mixed with grass fed butter
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   You're not regular butter grass fed butter and a
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   Oil that is made Dave Asprey. That's his name. It's an oil that's made out of coconut oil and
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.240]   Asprey I just read a long article about him
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:07.280]   He he was hiking into bet and was woozy because of course of the altitude and they gave him yak butter tea
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.560]   Which is my favorite is it any good? It's actually not as bad as it sounds. It sounds kind of riffs
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.800]   It's sort of soupy salty. Yeah, doesn't smell like yak though. Everything smells a little like that
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.280]   You're immune to it by then right?
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:26.560]   So he felt apparently amazing after this yak butter tea, you know his altitude sickness went away
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   I had the same experience in
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:34.200]   Cusco with coca coca leaf. Yeah, yeah makes you feel fine
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.360]   That would be a good business to stay
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.400]   Anyway, Dave who is kind of a leader of the quantified health movement
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:50.720]   Apparently he's gonna do a chain of bulletproof coffee. So watch out. It's great name here. It comes great name. It is a good name
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   Um, I had some
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.920]   Ayersats bulletproof coffee in Boulder this week
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.960]   It's interesting when you have fat in your coffee
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:06.280]   It's interesting. Yeah, I've been people been doing that for a long time with cream and yeah
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.800]   I like I put it have you been to fills. It's basically that's their secret. It's a secret heavy cream sugar and sugar
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.040]   And that's what we love. Yeah, really. That's what fills with the
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:21.520]   You're just anti-competitive. No, I love those guys. Fudge you're spreading. I love them. I love cyclas
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:28.680]   For barrel, I know I'm going to blue bottle tomorrow. This one on Dean Street on there. Oh, yeah, no. Oh, you didn't know I
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:35.040]   Didn't realize we've been wanting to do a coffee show actually I want to expand it beyond coffee
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.560]   I want to do a vice show so coffee chocolate
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.560]   It's funny what you're including advice. Do you need me to send you an email with some guards?
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.840]   suggestions
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   It has to be legal vices
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.160]   Vice not vice isn't the wrong leisure time. What are video games vice? Yeah
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.720]   Do you play video games I do a little bit I'm I'm surprised
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.120]   I you know you've kind of lived the life that the video game is emulating
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.520]   You don't really need to do the video game. Yeah, I'm on the board of a video game company
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.160]   So they sometimes expect you to use the product games and they have amazing products
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.640]   What what company kicks I I don't know kicks I
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.520]   Tell me about yeah, take a look. Yeah, they're games do your duty as a board member K. I K. I X
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:21.160]   UIE, but you know some of their maybe some of their games like battle pirates or work man
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.960]   So these are these are well
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.200]   They started as Facebook games and then they evolved into mobile games battle pirates sounds good
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.160]   But you know the thing I really love about the company is just all these artists creating incredible things
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   You know, I mean in a way that maybe that's what I love about blue bottle and
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:40.880]   Entrepreneurship in general is just people who are into it like your staff that were showing me how your control room
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.400]   Where they're into it, you know, and like when you can like help people that are do the thing that they're into it feels good
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.720]   I'd be kind of I'd be kind of interested in
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.360]   I
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:52:00.440]   Don't know I feel like we should cover more of this kind of create because I think I think what a lot of people
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.360]   That's at least outside of the area probably in the area to
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:10.600]   Think of entrepreneurs is really just more about trying to get rich trying to become a billionaire, right trying to make a unicorn and
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:17.280]   The entrepreneurs I know Gina include Gina and anneal are really not about that at all
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.600]   Right, you're about making stuff
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:26.120]   Is that right? Yeah, like well the idea it sounds like you're getting out like being passionate about
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:33.160]   Either a hobby or a cause or a set of values, you know that you're trying that you're trying to kind of express
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:39.240]   Yeah, you know, it's when I watch these stupid reality shows like the bachelor and the bachelor at whenever they have like on the lower third
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.240]   Like this person's an entrepreneur
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.760]   It's the new consultant, right?
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:53.840]   I guess that's a word that's a word that I've never felt our title that I've never felt
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.440]   Comfort with because I don't consider myself that I consider myself someone who makes software
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.360]   And I'm trusting taking a risk with a business in that process
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.200]   Which I guess is really the definition of entrepreneurs somebody takes a financial risk
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.680]   I guess is the literal meaning with the business so
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.360]   And I'm not an entrepreneur because this isn't a
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:20.880]   Financial risk we need to look this up you guys are both entrepreneurs. Oh, right? It's good here. We're denying it. Yeah
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   You're like
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.160]   You're deniers
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:38.120]   I feel like I feel weird identifying with even though my definition
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.360]   According to Wikipedia anybody who starts a business is an entrepreneur
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:50.720]   Anyone who starts a business? It's the process of starting a business typically a startup company offering an innovative product process or service
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.040]   And I think nowadays we think of them mostly as tech entrepreneurs, right?
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.600]   Just because the people we hang out with right maybe that's us
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:03.200]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure Aspiri thinks of himself as an entrepreneur even though he's selling fat and coffee
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.960]   Right, so that's an entrepreneur. It's funny. I just wrote about
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.920]   You know what what's the objective of entrepreneurship and you're right?
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   I think probably a lot of people think it's money
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.600]   Some people have something to prove like when I was doing military.com
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.800]   I mean I came from a really non-traditional background and felt like I needed something to prove
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:24.560]   But I did you know I did another company after military called affinity labs. Oh, yeah, and I think I think back to
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.420]   What was the purpose for me and to me it was?
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:32.920]   Kind of the adventure of going on a mission with people you admire, you know at the end of you know
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.600]   We talk about the screensavers all of these people that were really inspired
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.360]   By that experience and they're all still friends and they're all still doing cool stuff and to me
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.240]   That's the big thing. It's like can you work with cool people on stuff?
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:49.560]   You love right and like the other stuff comes out of that and that's the thing that I love and that's the thing in a way
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.300]   That I miss the most about the company. Why did you start military.com?
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.720]   You had you just gotten out of the Navy when you started?
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.880]   I had so I was in the Navy and then I worked in the Pentagon
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.440]   I went to business school and I was kind of a computer nerd programming
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.880]   You know at my first computers Sinclair ZX 80 Wow to date myself
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.280]   All right, and I came out and I was at a reason
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:13.040]   And I really wanted to start a company in 1999 it was the thing to do and and it's a good timing one of those people that was like
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.160]   If you want to be before the bubble burst if you exactly if you want to be in it
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.640]   Well, you know, I got fired. Do you know this whole story? I got fired and my from military?
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.120]   Oh, yeah
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.600]   I got we raised a lot of we raised like thirty million dollars
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.520]   I got fired and the idea of the site was a
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:32.760]   Destination for military well, you know the idea of the site was Facebook for the military my small mistake was just keeping it focused on the military
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.320]   I was this close. Yeah, you could have done face. I mean was that close anyway?
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   I got to come back to shut up to Zuckerberg
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:44.120]   You should have all right, but I I got to come back and we come back to shut the company down
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:51.720]   To the board party so this in 2000 well in 2001. We were out of money people were unhappy. It was a great site
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:56.480]   Well, you were doing great, but you know, there's a lot of well think about what happened in March of 2000
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.720]   Yeah, I mean bubble burst well
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:02.080]   We had a million dollar a month burn rate. Oh, so there was no more capital and you know
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.880]   This is what you know, we think that that was a unique period in time
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:11.480]   This is happening again companies incredible burn rates and so they're reliant on outside financing and when stuff started to fall apart
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.960]   It really fell apart advertisers didn't want to advertise they were done with the internet, right?
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:20.200]   And basically they hired a gray-haired CEO to take my place. You're too young you can't possibly
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.360]   I was 30 which is vision. Yeah, and it's funny
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.120]   I remember sitting in my office and he's sitting across from me and he says he's in my seat
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:33.120]   He says hey, be better if you didn't come by the office anymore. Oh Lord. Oh, it was really oh Lord
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:38.280]   And then I but then he then it got worse and worse and they're about to shut the company down
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.600]   We're talking about concealers. I came back to shut it down and we turned it around good
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.960]   So is nice we took the 747 and scraped the tail against the ground and yeah learned a lot. Yeah
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.920]   So these say that explains because I keep looking at like companies like uber which
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.280]   valued it more than 50 billion dollars now, right?
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.600]   But they keep going back to the well and sink and we have some work and we have some more they're not profitable, right?
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:05.640]   They're running through this money, right, right? The theory being that if you keep pumping money into it at some point
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:11.040]   They take off and make money. Well, they probably like Amazon they could probably get profitable very quickly
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.360]   But they're using the capital for expansion globally. That's probably a pretty safe
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:19.120]   And Amazon proved that worked right by building distribution centers
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.560]   Reinvesting instead of taking the the profit out of it. They built a pretty powerful company, right?
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.640]   But some of these other companies, you know, they're gonna find themselves in a really big
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.520]   problematic situation a lot of it has to do with ratchets early investors aren't gonna be able to make money
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.080]   You know, there's like only one possible outcome for these companies with billion dollar valuations
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:44.680]   It raises a lot and that is an incredibly successful public offering or a big acquisition and that won't play out for at least
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.520]   So when you look at company like Square for instance
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.840]   Jack Dorsey's one of his two companies
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.320]   He's got the Twitter thing as well
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.760]   So he's got something to fall back on but you look at Square where they're planning an IPO
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:03.800]   But it's below the value that they were valued at the last time they went to borrow money. Is that a bad thing?
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.640]   Well, how would you feel if well depends on the
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.840]   Investor it's a bad thing. It'd be interesting to lie. I don't know the nature of the investment
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.520]   So one element is what's the valuation because if you if it's gone down you might not make money
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.760]   But sometimes they have protection in the investment so they might have a kind of protection so that they get covered no matter
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:27.240]   What right which is really problematic for other investors, but I don't know that I don't know. Yeah, we I learned about that on Silicon Valley
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:33.240]   Right the one where that it was Silicon Valley. I learned that on I can't remember
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:41.640]   Where it's where the I guess maybe it wasn't Silicon Valley, but where the investors have a guarantee against the first dollar so
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:49.760]   They get they get made whole no matter what or almost no matter what unless you go later investors oftentimes have something in there to protect themselves as well
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:55.960]   Yeah, Gina did you raise money for your companies? We did we did kind of maybe I can get in next time
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:03.660]   I would invest in I would too. I would absolutely I love all of our companies. I would absolutely do that company
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:08.380]   Very small a relatively small amount with the coolest people right
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:15.480]   Well, yeah, we actually someone from Bloomberg beta rote Roy Baja. Oh, yeah Roy is incredible. Yeah, Roy is fantastic
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.200]   Um, yeah, we had some we have some really great investors. We absolutely love them. We very much don't want to disappoint them
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:25.480]   Perfect answer she's gonna keep her job. I think forever. That's hard though, isn't it?
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:31.080]   I mean, that's one of the I have a friend of it a startup and tanked and then all those people do get disappointed
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:36.880]   But on the other hand, they're big boys right and big girls. They know what they're doing there. This is a high-risk game
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:40.680]   I think it was Jason Calicana's told me, you know, you can count on
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.200]   Something like 80% of your investments to lose money
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:49.560]   If you get one in five make money and if they make enough money, you're you're all right
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.080]   So it's a risky it's a risky business
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:57.520]   It is it is but it's you know, it's something like as a founder. I take it extremely seriously
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.320]   And you know and it's something that I'm you know
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.000]   working really hard
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.400]   Make sure that they're that they're glad in the end that they invested in me
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.800]   I mean, there's different kind of philosophies right there's some people are like trying to find that uber, right?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.760]   They want the unicorn company to return the fund and you know the data would say that that works
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.160]   So maybe like Ron Conway investing in a million companies is great
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160]   but I would rather work with somebody like Gina and
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.080]   You know really work on a small number of companies that you really feel great about that your part of the journey
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.320]   It isn't just a financial investment. It's a you know, it
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.160]   You know, you're part of a team doing something that matters
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:37.520]   How do you feel about bills like the Jobs Act that change the requirements for investors?
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:44.200]   You know, thanks to Dodd-Frank and others there are laws about how what income level you have to have you have to be
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.800]   presumption is you have to be savvy you have to be able to
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.920]   You presume to be able to lose the money and to know what you're doing
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.560]   And so as a result a lot of people are kept out of the investment market and the Jobs Act has kind of changed that it started to change
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.600]   Well Angelist has changed all these syndicates you doing this indicate you're in yeah
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.440]   I mean, I feel like people are gonna get taken advantage of by things like that that those
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.200]   Seems to me those protections are not a bad idea
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.200]   Well, do the protections really protect people?
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.680]   I mean you can invest in a lot of public equities and lose a lot of money you can find a way to lose money
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.680]   I mean, I do think that
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.560]   We're gonna find that the venture business is difficult right now it looks like everybody's a winner and
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.320]   That doesn't it that will that will change yeah
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.520]   Yeah, and you know
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:35.560]   It'll be interesting how people feel and react when they lose a lot of money in a syndicate or on Angelist or like we
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:41.200]   Seen we kick starter and some other things or even public some of these these venture companies the companies aren't what they appear to be
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   And that's usually when regulators get involved
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.600]   We're gonna take a break Christopher Michael is here for formerly a military comm. He's now an investor with Nautilus
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   And is a great photographer as you'll find if you go to his website Christopher Michael M. I C H E L
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:03.400]   Dot com also Gina, Japan II here from think up dot com. How are things going at maker base?
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.080]   Good good things are really good
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.200]   We just thought we also do feature called inspiration
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.120]   So you can you go on to make her base and you can find a maker like Leo for example that you who you love and who you admire
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120]   And you can say that they inspire you
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:24.320]   Yeah, which is really cool. It's really neat to see people say you know this person, you know really influenced me and and
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.840]   You know change my thinking or inspired me to to make something so that that's really that's really fun
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.920]   And I recognize there's an inspiration right there. Yeah, Marcus Sheridan inspires David G Johnson
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.960]   I recognize that gorgeous Gina Tarpani design. I love your stuff. I really do
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.000]   Not my design. We have an incredible designer that would that we
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.280]   Stuff though, I just feel like I know that that I could would look at that and say oh, yeah, that's a Gina company
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.480]   I think it's a Gina company
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.160]   We're take a break when we come back Apple has finally released Apple music for Android is it enough?
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:12.200]   We'll find out just a little bit but first a word from Blue Apron. I love this company. This is a great idea not blue bottle
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:20.280]   Blue Apron the blue Apron is what the apprentices were at the Cordon blue cooking school in Paris
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.380]   That's a sign that they're learning
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:29.480]   The the techniques of the masters and I think this is a really appropriate name for a company that does
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:35.720]   Something very special they deliver meals to you, but unlike other companies. They're not cooked
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.120]   They just give you all the ingredients you need to make an amazing dinner
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.640]   For just you in a loved one or for your whole family you get to pick for less than ten dollars a meal
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:51.800]   You don't have to do any shopping and you never have any waste because they give you exactly what you need and what's great is these amazing
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.280]   Recipes you get this nice recipe card with pictures
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:01.480]   There's videos on the site too if you need some instructions on how different techniques how to do things and then you have made an
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.720]   Incredible dish. This is a shawarma dish that Jason Howell made
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.120]   I think last month from his blue apron box and once you've made that meal
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.880]   Your family's gonna love you. It's a very impressive thing to make for date night
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.200]   But you'll also know how to make it again
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.960]   And I think it really broadens your repertoire
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.720]   They don't they don't say it's a cooking class in the box
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:25.720]   But I feel like it's both a great meal and a cooking class in the box every meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.480]   You don't have to worry about the grocery store. No more sad takeout
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.320]   No more fast food and they can make it easy no matter what your dietary preferences are
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.560]   You'll get dishes like Treteria style cheeseburgers with crispy rosemary garlic potatoes and aioli
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:48.640]   Or coconut curry braised cauliflower with aromatic basmati rice and cilantro chutney right in your own kitchen
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.800]   You'll be using new ingredients
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:56.960]   By the way those both were from this week's menu. That's what's neat the menu changes every week you pick the recipes you want
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.480]   You can arrange the delivery so they match your your your schedule
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.840]   They come in a nice refrigerated box all fresh never frozen and the produce comes from local farms
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.640]   peaked picked at the peak of perfection
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:18.360]   Just delicious stuff and you'll use ingredients. I learned I've been learning some really nice new ingredients that you'll want to use again
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.280]   Like watermelon radishes and pharaoh and purple potatoes

[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:46.240]   Twits this week in Google this week is it's kind of wide ranging anything you want to talk about because we got two great people here
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:52.480]   And I always want to give our our panelists the free reign Christopher Michael and the Gina Trapani
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.280]   Finally took them a while Apple finally released Apple music for Android and Gina. I think have you looked at it yet?
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   I
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.920]   Haven't looked at it. I actually now that it's on Android. I have a reason
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.720]   I have a device and a reason that to really look at it
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.760]   I you know I read a little bit about it when Apple music first came out people seemed to like it
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.800]   But you know with Spotify and play music. I don't feel like I have a need for it
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.680]   I don't I don't either I can I continue to subscribe to both Spotify and play music
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.940]   What I find interesting is Apple making what is clearly like a nice Android app, right?
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.360]   I mean, this is Android II isn't it yeah?
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:34.800]   Is it called beats music or is it different? This is it's asked called Apple music. It's not anything like the original beats app
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.800]   They did have a beats app for
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.300]   Android, but I think they went back to the drawing board it actually
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:48.680]   If you use Apple music on an Apple device well, you'll immediately recognize where you are the onboarding process is the same with the
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:55.160]   Red bubbles and stuff, but it's also native. I mean this hamburger menu. That's not on the Apple. That's a very Android
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:01.240]   Yeah, look and I think they I think this is nice. It's it's really Apple's first app
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.580]   They had another one called what it was it switched to iOS, which I don't think that counts
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:10.440]   But clearly they hired some good Android developers, and I think did a nice job of
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.900]   I have to take a moment to kavech about
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:19.340]   About the play stores search capabilities if you type in Apple music right now into this into the in play store
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:25.660]   Yeah, don't get the Apple music app. It's very weird. I think just search for I think what I did is I just search for Apple
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.940]   And and then you get the two Apple apps
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.800]   Yeah, Apple move to iOS forget beats pill plus
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.740]   Unless you have a beats pill
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:41.960]   And then they're okay Apple. I know but I agree with you. I mean it's really weird
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:47.660]   I think so are Google you're in the search business. I know this is their core competency. It's it's really strange
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.540]   But yeah, I'm down. I'm down letting it now
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.460]   I
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.060]   Apple music on
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:59.980]   On iOS devices and on on OS 10 that it works through iTunes, right?
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:06.900]   I've been avoiding iTunes like the play. Yeah, yeah, I think we should talk about iTunes iTunes is the canary in the coal mine
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:12.100]   Those Apple people have some problems. I know where is my music. Tell me where my music is. I can't find it
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.700]   Yeah, is it in the cloud is it in my me? Is it an Apple music?
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.660]   What do you where do you want it to be?
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:25.100]   Forever I need anywhere you want to be I'm with you on that. Um,
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:30.500]   Don't give me started on I see even even Apple rabbit Apple fans hate iTunes
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:38.100]   Right, it's no, it's true even the Apple vlogosphere. Yeah, you know, it's a blog. It's a we'll we'll rag on it. No excuse
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.980]   But yeah, no, this is an impressive somebody at Apple definitely read the the Android design
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:49.580]   Guidelines, so that's nice, but of course because it's an Apple product on the Android store. You've got
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.660]   2,831 star
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:56.460]   from just you know, I probably people who never even tried it just
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:01.100]   Garbage more garbage for Apple. Why would you ever use Apple?
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:06.060]   Lots of bugs buggy. I don't know. I've worked fine on my hey
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.340]   This is the 6p a geno would you have you did you decide what to do with your phone of you?
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:16.460]   Yeah, I got the the 5x I can't put my 6b order and I did the 5x. Yeah, I just want a smaller phone
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:20.300]   It's like he was a little too big for me. I know a lot of people are very happy with 5x
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:27.180]   I like it. I like a lot it feels it feels a little it felt a little flimsy at first because it's light. It's lighter than the
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:35.220]   Mt. It feels like the empty plastic shell. Yeah, it does it does but it's a nice phone. I've been really enjoying it good
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.940]   I'm glad you're happy with six be bin for you. You know at first. I was having problems effect
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:44.960]   I think people who watch regularly saw me just struggle with this thing because the camera was
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:52.080]   Unresponsive, but I think I was running an app that was was causing problems because once once now it's now
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   It's just fine. So
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.220]   What ideas I rebuilt it. I don't know if that was necessary
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:02.340]   But but it makes me want to rush out and buy one right now. No, it's good. It's good
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:07.100]   I just really don't think I just got a good face. No, no, I just
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:12.020]   I just refreshed it, but I don't think that that actually was necessary
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:17.620]   I think I had an app on here that was just notifying all the time and it was keeping everything else busy
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:21.860]   But I know I I am it's a beautiful screen
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:27.260]   The fingerprint reader is amazing. I mean, I don't know what your experiences on the 5x
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:31.500]   but you know on the 6p it's on just like the 5x is on the back here and
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.180]   It's just you don't even have to do the on button you just touch it and it's all you boom
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:41.900]   You're in and I just really like that. It's my first experience with it with a fingerprint sensor on any phone
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.980]   And it has been amazing. I'm not having to enter my last pass pass. Yeah, I'm being up unlock the phone
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.780]   And it's just it's it's really great. It's a huge
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:54.300]   Upgrade just in like, you know every time use I use the fingerprint
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:58.940]   We have the same camera in the 5x and the 6p. It's a great camera. I think yep great camera
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.020]   Is it fast enough to get out in motion?
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:09.700]   Yeah, yeah, it's been taking great photos. I'm on Instagram. I posted a few photos on Instagram and yeah, it's really really nice
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.780]   I'm still in the happy know I always take a bunch of her
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:17.700]   Once and then one of one of them well this has that that feature that burst mode where if you take a bunch of pictures
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.820]   You could it picks the but it thinks is the best one yep
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.460]   I wish it would throw out the rest, but yeah, I need to play with that a little bit more
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.580]   Yeah, yeah, I turned on HDR and it does that like processing progress
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:32.180]   Yeah, I could do without that. I probably turn off HDR, but
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:37.780]   On the other hand I need to understand a little bit more what I'm actually getting for all time that processing time
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.180]   And I'm not totally clear battery life's pretty good
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:45.820]   Still not great. I think the 5x is maybe even a little bit less. I think
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:52.060]   Yeah, it's okay by by 11 or 12 at night. It's on down to 5%
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.100]   Which is fine. I should be going to bed at that point anyway
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.860]   It hasn't quit on me in the middle of a day. That's right
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.300]   This seems surprising you that they haven't launched that as a feature like the two-day cell phone
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.500]   I mean when people rush out and buy that just make it a little bit thicker. Yeah, that's what I mean
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.500]   I think people would would be okay with that
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.060]   Yeah, surprise me crazy
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:15.820]   Everybody's decided except Apple Apple does that the success plus goes forever, but everybody else has decided well
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:21.620]   We just give you fast charging and just charge it and then you don't have to worry about that. That's not the solution. I agree
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.340]   I'm with you
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.620]   By the way notice I am using Firefox. I found out yesterday
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.520]   That you can run
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:37.120]   Firefox on Android and it supports all the Firefox desktop plugins including
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:44.700]   You block origin the ad blocker of choice and my ad blocker of choice and sorry Paul. We're blocking the ads. Sorry and
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:50.800]   Last pass as a plugin. Oh, yeah. Wow. Yeah
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.460]   That's nice. Yeah, so firefox
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:13:00.940]   So the it's a little slower because it loads a bunch of extensions but a lot faster because it blocks all the ads
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:09.020]   Yeah, and adds on mobile are a real problem. Yeah, I know Apple Apple really kind of stirred a hornet's nest by putting making ad blockers capable
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:13.260]   Possible on the iPhone, but I think that people have seen wow what a difference
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.660]   Yeah, yeah, cool. I'm gonna have to try that. Yeah
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:22.660]   Chrome support going away for XP I
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.740]   Feel bad about this first Microsoft pulls the plug in April and says we're not gonna update XP
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:32.340]   We're not gonna update IE. I think the last version of IE for XP was IE eight
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:40.900]   And so we I was telling everybody well if you insist on using XP at least use Chrome because that's gonna be kept up to date
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.660]   until April
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.820]   So one year after Microsoft pulled the plug on Windows XP
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.980]   Google's gonna do the same with Chrome. I don't you know just a word of warning
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.620]   reasonable, right prepare yourselves
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:59.700]   Who's using XP lots of people that right you want to see you want to see a shocking pie chart?
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.340]   windows usage
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.940]   By
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.940]   using windows 3.1 version
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.500]   I don't think there's a whole lot of 3.1
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:16.460]   XP still has 12 and a half percent market share. Let me see if I can find the
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:22.460]   The graph because it's really it's it's how many of those people are using AOL dial-up
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.340]   And my Yahoo right
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:30.860]   I wish I could this is this graph does not look real good
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:36.500]   I don't know. I've done a lot of users are kind of like my you know older relatives where it's like they had an ex-computer
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:43.420]   They just moved on to a smartphone and a tablet just never turned off or upgraded or changed the desktop computer
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:48.220]   And they're just kind of stuck there on XP because they just stopped buying new desktop computers
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:55.660]   Well, they think of it as furniture and it's not disposable like it is right. Yeah, right like oh the TV still works
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.180]   Right. They by the way probably still have a tube TV
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.340]   And you know and let's face it. I mean windows really lost its way with the investor, right?
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.940]   So I think people just kind of yeah, they didn't want to go to Vista
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:10.500]   Yeah, and by then it was like they're just stuck in it
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.420]   Good news. They're not gonna merge Chrome OS and Android. Are you relieved about that Gina?
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:24.180]   We didn't get to talk with you about that. Yeah, I imagine that you got that you all covered that last week. We were very upset
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:26.140]   Yeah
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.740]   Oh, you're very upset at the prospect of them merging. Yes
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.020]   I mean there's still this like question in my mind about it, right?
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:37.740]   Like there is this like there's two major products that are like really different and yet really similar
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:43.700]   But and so the outcome in the end just to make sure that I'm up to date that Google said that there's no merge happening
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.700]   We're committed to both still
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:49.540]   Exactly
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:54.900]   You know yeah, am I happy about that? Yes, it still feels like an unresolved issue though
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.340]   I mean it feels like they're reserving like we're moving towards something's gonna happen
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.340]   And I just don't know yeah
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:06.860]   You know what I'm very interested to see is what they do with the pixel C
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:10.220]   because I feel like this tablet is
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:17.060]   Potentially what they meant first of all, it's a pixel right up to now pixels have been
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:25.940]   Yeah, it has the kickstand kind of like you know, then that's the new thing all the kids are doing it
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.940]   But it's Android
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:32.020]   But I wonder and it's delayed right or it's just not gonna be out till next month
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.340]   I wonder if this is gonna be the first iteration of something that's a
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:40.580]   Little bit more like a desktop or like a well like Apple true
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:46.140]   And I don't why are these companies doing this is there is there a hue and cry to turn your tablet into a laptop?
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:53.860]   Because that's that's essentially what this is all about right is taking desktop OS is and making them touch and then making them more
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.700]   Tablity if you had to get out of keyboard
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:02.900]   Don't underestimate the revenue implications of having the additional things we can sell people it's just more stuff
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:08.020]   I don't think that this is about consumer demand. I mean I see these commercials about you know the laptop
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:11.380]   And then I don't know what device it was but it just feels like a manufacturer
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:16.900]   Like the companies came up with this thing to sell to people. I just don't know anyone who's like I really really want
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.620]   I don't know. I don't know
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:23.900]   Well, if you want that get a MacBook Air. I mean well, right
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.020]   Yeah, this is new which is better than an air. I think yeah
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.620]   You said you don't like the fact that only has one port the table. I don't like the yeah
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:35.660]   I'm upset with those guys probably about the $80 dongle though, right? I did I have the dongle
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.900]   But it's just one of those things you just don't remember to bring
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:43.340]   I find though like connect stuff to the computer lesson. I might have yeah a mad that I did and
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:49.140]   Not having you know having that simple form factors. It's not to be said it really works great. I'm a fan
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.140]   Yeah, I actually really like the Macbook
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:55.460]   Not that that matters on this show. This is a Google show
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.780]   Anything new about Facebook. They're doing they're launching this
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:02.740]   Probably today or tomorrow their new app for news
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:06.300]   What is it called
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.580]   Kali what is it?
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.260]   Thank you
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:12.900]   Facebook
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.100]   Notify is that a yes, is that messenger?
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.660]   It's not out yet
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:19.900]   so
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:26.900]   Who was it was telling me on Twitter that really the battleground now in mobile is used to be the front page
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:34.340]   Right they want you want to be the icon on the front page of your iPhone or Android device now the battleground is the notification
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:42.060]   Because the notifications get right in your face and say hey and if you can get in that notification space
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:46.700]   You can do so much better if you ever tried to turn off notifications. I messengers. It doesn't work
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.540]   It doesn't like that. No, it doesn't know face. It does is very well
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:55.940]   So notify is going to give you notifications from news outlets and other sources
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:02.580]   It's in effect Facebook's bid to own the notification space. Can you believe that? Do you want more notifications or less?
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.860]   Well, we just talking about that
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:10.340]   But I don't want them on our wrist. I don't want them in my pocket. I don't want I mean I want the right notifications
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.460]   Don't you want the right notification? Do you want?
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:16.860]   When your mom sends you an email when your wife calls
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:25.140]   When your ubers arrived when your ubers here when that package got delivered that you're waiting for I don't I guess
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.900]   a news I made the mistake once of installing some like CNN
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:37.620]   New York Times and Wall Street Journal and turning on breaking news notifications and all three seems like a good idea
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:41.260]   Right seems like I would never miss a thing. They sure let you know about everything
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.100]   Well, this is the thing
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:54.060]   Very there are very there are circumstances when I want breaking news alerts. They're very rare
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.660]   I mean, I want to know if a plane hits the world trade center
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:01.860]   I'd like to know right they over you they over use it. They over use it. Maybe bankle Jackson dies
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:05.180]   I found out about that on Twitter. I mean, you know, maybe but like really
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.440]   Most days I don't want there's no
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:16.240]   You don't want you don't want a notification for Vogue about the 10 best dressed people this week because that's one of the things you would
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.420]   That would just it would make me enraged your daily your daily meditation from headspace
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.580]   No, it shouldn't be in the notification. I'll do that one. It's time. I don't want to be notified
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:34.900]   Flashback station from getting a notification blocker software. That's what we need. We need the anti-notify app if they had that
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:38.260]   Notify me seriously. Hey, I know you got a run
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:38.500]   Gina

[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.260]   Or should I go ahead and do it now because I know you got to get out of here
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.900]   All right, cool. Thank you. Well quick tip this week and I just start to see this in my own app

[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:24.300]   You know see you later and so I open up this message in in inbox and underneath the message
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:28.860]   I get I got three choices for reply and they were like sounds good
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.060]   Appreciate it Roger that it was like three natural language
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:39.260]   Responses and I got to tell you those are responses that I would have like I would have absolutely responded
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:44.780]   Sounds good. So you tap on your response and the the one that you want to send and you get a chance to edit it
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.820]   If you want and you send it so this thing is basically
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:55.620]   Suggesting responses based on the content of your email. Is it on your Android or on your desktop? Where is it happening?
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:01.780]   It's in Android. I saw it. Yeah, so when I invite you for the blue bottle and you're like no way and I'm like
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:06.700]   Why did you say that you're like? I just push this automated. It wasn't me just a push to bow. That was me
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:11.100]   Yeah, this is okay sounds good. Thanks for the heads up copy that and sounds good
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.780]   Thanks, like these were these were some of the responses and you see the responses kind of that at the bottom
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:21.140]   Of the screen. Do you know doesn't look like it's learning or is are they like hand?
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:24.140]   It's take a wait a minute. I just got one
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:29.900]   Okay, yeah, it's working Chris Mike Christopher Michael says he won't be here because the traffic's terrible
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:35.060]   So I can do nice got it or thanks. Thanks. I mean they're very
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:40.700]   Appropriate I'm a senior got it got it and you can edit it you can add another
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:48.620]   Whatever, but it's using keywords, right? So it is gonna. Yeah, I guess it doesn't do it for every email
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.460]   Because I tried other emails
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:57.300]   Yeah, let me yeah, see it doesn't do it for every email and you don't have to say I reply you just it just does it
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:01.500]   It just does it. Oh wait a minute here it is Steve Gibson sent me a note saying holy crap
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500]   I pro bad pro tomorrow. Oh
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:06.900]   And I say oh look woohoo
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:14.780]   That is great news or awesome. It saw that there were all those exclamation marks in there. That's pretty good. Oh, well pretty good clearly
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:19.180]   Let's see woohoo. That's wow
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:22.020]   Yeah
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:28.900]   So it is looking at the it's again Google reading your mail setting that we can just have it automatically reply without it being looking at the email
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:33.180]   That's where we're going
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:38.220]   There should I should just be able to turn that out. I just it pretty soon it was be AI to AI
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:41.220]   Stand back random crap
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.260]   I'm not seeing it on every thread
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:48.020]   I'm looking at another thread which has been gone on kind of long and I said different tones at different times
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.260]   And there's just no suggestion
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:54.620]   So I think that it just it only shows you suggestions when it maybe that's your suggestion to not reply to that email
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:24:01.140]   About email archive. Yeah, yeah, so maybe like if a can understand stuff
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.140]   Hmm
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:08.340]   It doesn't answer it so that's cool. I don't suggest anything
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:15.140]   It's it is pretty cool by the way that was interesting. You just did I had your email up on my desktop
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:20.140]   I opened it and put got it into on Android here and it put it in the desktop - oh
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.420]   We're I didn't know that the desk
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:28.420]   A little bit of Google waves sneak it in there. Yeah, yeah, sorry
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.580]   That was painful. I shouldn't have brought that up. It was a little bit sad
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:38.540]   But I like that wave lives on wave in other ways through other apps and we now know that Gina Trapani lives on we're so glad

[01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:03.500]   Your company is the people you hire and that's why you can't take this lightly of course
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:08.780]   It's the worst time when you're short-handed to have to find new people
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:13.180]   So you know sometimes you might rush through that process don't use zip recruiter
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.420]   You'll post jobs in more than a hundred job sites
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:21.020]   Including Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn and Craigslist all the social networks
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:26.820]   You post once and candidates will start rolling in almost immediately. They also will match your needs with their
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:31.540]   Database of nearly six million current resumes and that's fantastic
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:36.380]   So you're gonna find a bunch of quality candidates. The nice thing is they're not gonna call you
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:42.900]   They're not gonna email you all of the candidates roll into your zipper critter interface. So it's very easy to screen them
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:48.580]   Get rid of the separate the wheat from the chaff and hire the right person
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:54.220]   fast, I think zipper critter is a bone to building a great company
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:29:00.180]   It's been used by over 400,000 businesses including twin and you can try it now absolutely free for the next four days
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:08.180]   At zipper cruder comm slash tweet. We got an email from Scott a happy zipper cruder client. He said the recruiting process
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:11.660]   Used to be so painful. You know how that feels don't you?
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:17.940]   For our I'd post to several places. I get a million resumes, but only a few responses from qualified candidates
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:23.980]   It was torture, but with zipper cruder we post once we get qualified candidates in one easy to review place
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.500]   We have hired some of our best employees
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.460]   using zip recruiter

[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:52.300]   So you were always a little bit of a photographer Chris or yeah, yeah
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.540]   Hey Leo can I ask you what I'm noticing the chap board here?
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:58.740]   These are people that are those are people watching the show I've been watching it the whole time and I just want to say
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:04.980]   mistake you have really incredible people watching the show very nice. No really sweet. It's funny
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:10.160]   We I started doing this in the like the early 90s when a door I can I were doing radio
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:15.260]   And it was this is IRC. I mean it was always IRC even a tech TV
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:19.700]   We had remember I don't know if you remember we had that like 3d chat going on, but having
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:23.340]   a live studio audience and a live chat audience I
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:28.100]   Think is a great way to kind of keep me honest is to focus us
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:32.980]   But also to give us good ideas and they get off target. Yeah, a lot of times you just having fun
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:37.380]   But that's fine too. It's not like discussion boards where people kind of go crazy. They're people are super nice
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:41.540]   They're like well we can Gina Mars worms like hey, so nice having you on the show. Yeah
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:48.180]   Yeah, yeah, there's some some of the best people I know are in the chat room. Who do you know some of those people?
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:53.660]   Some I've actually met yeah, and a lot of these a lot of people you're seeing they were always here right?
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:54.660]   I love that
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:57.500]   but then yeah, I've met a few of them and
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:04.220]   It they're really kind of fun people and they smell good says M and 7 yeah, but I don't like your thoughts for that
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:09.540]   I kind of not sure that but the other thing is they're all over the world. So that's kind of fun, too
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:14.380]   It's incredible. Yeah, the internet thanks thanks to the internet. Yeah, we're everywhere. It's really amazing
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:16.500]   so
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:22.540]   Cameras you have a roley which is making now is that a film camera? Oh, yeah, it's a film camera. That's a medium format film is
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:28.300]   That is a work of art and a beautiful thing, but why would you shoot film nowadays?
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:31.700]   Just because you like the hardware
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:36.520]   So you have a lot of old cameras around we do none of them functioning unfortunately
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.300]   Here's there's a camera. There's a shot as you can see right there
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:44.180]   You can actually position the camera where your laptop is yeah, and people can see it
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:49.700]   Yeah, that is it this is what a twin lens reflects right?
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:54.540]   So you shoots from the top it's what they call a belly shooter you shoot down from the top
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:59.760]   And then you're seeing through the top lens, but the camera shoots at the bottom one is that that how it works
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.860]   Yeah, exactly well
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:05.780]   So I've had some of these cameras around for display because I thought they were beautiful
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:12.380]   Did you see this movie this documentary finding Vivian Meyer? Do you know this movie? I didn't see the movie
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:15.180]   But I know the story that's an amazing story. She was a nanny
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.380]   and
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:23.820]   Never published her photos never shown anybody but took amazing street photos black and white street photos in the 50s
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:24.780]   I'm right in Chicago
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:30.720]   So basically they bought her storage facility when she passed away and in there was you know thousand guys
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:36.100]   Found only one one 20 film. Yeah, and I saw this movie and I couldn't recommend it more
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.740]   I mean her photos are not to see it incredible. She's got to be
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:45.660]   One of the most prolific and profound street photographers of all time and the photos are great and actually she used this camera
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:49.500]   She is the roller. Oh, you can see it in some of the images. Yeah, you're self-portrait
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.700]   Which is one of the first shots here, but there's a few unusual things about this camera
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:59.020]   Not only does it take incredible photos, but you're also shooting at a different angle. You're not shooting down
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.860]   You're standing up you're standing up and you're shooting and you're looking down there
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.860]   She is more subtle and so I like well have this camera
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:09.660]   So I'm gonna get some 120 film and started taking pictures and the quality is incredible
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:14.620]   Okay, but incredible you take 12 pictures at a time 10 10 10
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.620]   You can't review them right
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:19.820]   Until you develop them and oh by the way
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.940]   You have to develop them right there's no you go you take them to a lab
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.620]   Maybe we should talk about this because I get all these questions all the time
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:32.020]   So I shoot film 30% of the time. Okay, she's mostly 35 millimeter, but some 120
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:40.740]   I take the pictures and then I put them in a little mailer and send them to North Coast photographic services and say I want the scans back now
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:45.740]   Oh, okay, so they don't just develop they develop the film, but then they scan the negatives
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.940]   Yes, so you're gonna get a digital yes image, right?
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.420]   And now is it noticeably better though than a good quality?
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:59.180]   I see you also the Sony a yeah, yeah, should we do it on your computer? Yeah, yeah, yeah is it on your website?
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.180]   Yeah, go to my website. Okay
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.700]   Is this the secret entrance?
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:09.620]   This might be the secret entrance. Don't show anybody what we're seeing right now. Let's go to actually let your sights on smug mug
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:15.420]   Here why don't you log in and you could do it. Okay, right and the only reason is because my laptop is connected and you have some
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:19.740]   Weird funky type-c connector on yours. We can't do anything with well
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:23.180]   You don't even have like I have to know where actually I think we have the cables and everything
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.860]   Somewhere because I have a type-c as well
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:35.420]   So you know my friend Chris Markwort who's also a film part-time film photographer
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:41.700]   Says one of the benefits of doing this is you have to be very thoughtful. You don't have the luxury of shooting 50 images
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.100]   Checking them in between
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:51.300]   Resetting until you find the right shot you have to in your head get the shot right and and you and you have to really think about it
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.620]   These well what I'm doing is is very meditated
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:35:00.460]   Portraiture so like I'm light metering people you hit by the way. That's another thing these don't have light
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.580]   Yes, this one actually has an old light meter, but I don't trust it. Yeah, so
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.740]   You have to buy a light meter so you can remember when the photographers
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:10.260]   They come and they put a thing on your forehead and they go. Oh, yeah
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:16.760]   Let's check that yeah, and they're getting the little light reading and you have to translate that is this where you wanted to go
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.660]   so this is a unretouched scan or
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:25.620]   Yeah, I see these images on your Instagram all the time. I just love them these portraits you do
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:29.380]   There's a lot of pictures and which film do you shoot?
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:33.540]   I
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:38.700]   120 Kodak or Fuji and you can get all of it you'd shoot a plus X or
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:43.220]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, not triax. Do you shoot the I do I should try extra?
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.060]   It's a little grainier though, right?
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:50.260]   Because it's ISO 400. Yeah, but it's really I mean it's another thing for digital photographers
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:57.540]   You can't change the ISO you got you got whatever the film is that's the sensitivity of the film you're stuck with it
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:01.700]   These are beautiful images you mind if we show these as we scroll no no no no no no
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.700]   So each one of these is a gallery
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.220]   So you know some of these people care so sure right
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:14.860]   She must be fun to take portrait. So this is this is a shot that I'm not supposed to show anyone. Okay, Prince Charles
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:21.980]   What you can see him right there. Oh, I'm not supposed to show that what the what okay? Yeah, yeah, I don't know why
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:27.900]   I'm sorry, but the prince does not allow images of himself to be desired without a
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:33.180]   Let's try something like that. Let's try this. I mean here's my problem. You can already see it
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:37.060]   I have this is just the one of the reasons I would think you would want to do your own
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:43.500]   Processing developing is because then you at least can push the film
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.060]   I guess you could give the lab instructions. Yeah, but you don't necessarily
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.900]   I mean you do I guess you if you're gonna push the film you have to push the whole role
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:57.180]   That means developing it you know Kyra's doll from market. Oh, yeah, you know
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:02.300]   That's that okay. Let's but we want to pick an image and you can show me the difference why
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:07.880]   You're shooting film as opposed to digital. Can you find an example of that?
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:12.860]   I'm sorry didn't have all this setup for you. Let's see
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:23.660]   I'm distracting you of course by talking to you while you're doing this some people can do that some people can't so these are 35 millimeter
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:30.220]   film shots, so that's not the yeah, I'm not gonna shoot 35 if I'm gonna shoot I'm gonna shoot medium format or even
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:37.700]   Large format. I'm gonna shoot. Oh, I'm a more pixel in fact. You have a view camera - in fact, I'm glad you brought that up
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:43.740]   I just came back from the North Pole and brought a new format camera Wow and
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:47.340]   You can sort of see this is
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.540]   North Pole scans here we go
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:59.740]   So these are my this is a mama. These are yeah, yeah, and you can sort of get a sense of
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:08.580]   Is there more detail is it the more dynamic range what is it that you more detail more dynamic range?
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:14.340]   These are color shots. I normally shoot black and white and you've got a kind of cross processing here a little bit
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.340]   Yes, it looks a little different
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:20.740]   Yes, and then is that because of the film you choose? Yeah, it could be the film and that's Fuji. Yeah
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:23.580]   This is the the trip was a pretty incredible trip
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:30.060]   There's only one way to get there and this is on this Russian icebreaker the world's largest the most powerful icebreaker
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:34.740]   I had so much fun watching your pictures and I guess it was Instagram that I saw maybe Facebook
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:40.060]   Because I'm watching this process this progress of course you deep you posted those after you got back
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:44.180]   I'm sure check this guy. This is the captain captain. Raimus. He's not joking around
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:50.300]   He's talking like this is too much ice to get through here because you're done taking pictures
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:55.180]   You're done. There's no more pictures. Yeah, the prince is on the boat. Yeah, that's kind of yes
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:58.340]   Yeah, what he was saying, but you know, I mean this is look at this
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:04.580]   Wow, these old this is on a place called France Joseph lands, which is around 81 degrees north now
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:10.740]   It's this sort of abandoned island chain where all these Russian is climate an issue as well
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:14.580]   I mean the temperature on film. Don't you have to be careful there or no?
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:18.700]   You do you have to store the film kind of carefully, but I didn't have any problems
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.220]   I mean the bigger problem is there's only ten exposures per right, you know
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:28.060]   So I'm like constantly taking the back out of the now can you you don't have to put getting a bag to do that right?
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:32.180]   You can do that. No, no, no. No, it's no problem. Did you bring a bunch of backs with you or oh?
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:34.620]   Yeah, yeah, oh back's oh now. It's just the reels
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:40.500]   Nope, just film so I was like changing your roll and roll in the film on to the yeah real as you're going
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:45.420]   Yeah, okay, I'm gonna stick with digital because it seems like this is a lot more work it
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:51.460]   You think so you think so, but you know that the quality is really really you can tell the difference
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:55.140]   I think so. I mean this is all well. This is all digital
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:56.860]   You know it looks great
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:02.800]   I mean look if you need the shot digital is the way to go look at that now see I you know if you had said look at the
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:08.340]   Detail I'm getting in this great medium format film. I would have bought it, but that was digital
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:14.860]   And is that the a7r you know that a7 - oh well, what do I have here or what do I know you have an a7 here?
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.860]   Is that a Leica D810 oh?
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:21.540]   The icon the Nikon. Yeah, so you know if I have these are kind of interesting
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:24.500]   This is this is like a
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:30.700]   Now do when did you go up on the Golden Gate bridge? I'm not supposed to talk about that or even show these pictures ah
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:36.500]   I mean because they used to there used to be a way to get up there
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:42.540]   But I think since 9/11 nobody's allowed up there anymore. Well some people you have friends if in high places literally
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.900]   That is a great shit was a really
[01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:50.100]   Interest is it scary up there? You're wired in right? You're a little into that thing. It's a little scary
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:53.340]   Well, actually you take it there's an elevator that goes part of the way
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:58.660]   Yeah, and then you walk up a kind of ladder system and get real down that there's a spine and you walk along the spine
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.580]   And it's but are you clipped into like when you go on the Sydney Harbor?
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:07.980]   Bridge you're actually yeah, this isn't different you're walking up that that cable the cable. This isn't that
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:12.580]   Oh, okay, this is a little you're just looking at a door. This is a little more time. You're in the tower. You're in the tower
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:15.420]   Yeah, oh, yeah, I'll go back to that. What do you think this is?
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:19.020]   What is this it's a dinosaur?
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:21.540]   How is that?
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.540]   Is it a whale going on here?
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:28.260]   It's a whale that is a flying fish that is leapt from the sea what's going on here? Oh?
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:30.260]   Oh
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:36.740]   Who's ever to see the red nose? Yes genius? Yes, Ryan knows exactly
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:45.080]   This is the shot. So I did a magazine. It's underwater and I flipped the image because he looked like he was flying and it was really a cool thing but
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:51.020]   Very flip it. That's what that's the very few people get that. Yeah, Brian. You got good eyes
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.820]   How'd you know that Brian Brian Burnett our technical director?
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:56.340]   He picked right up on that he rotated it
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:02.740]   But anyway, this camera takes cool pictures and I like using it and you know what I'm gonna give you at the end of this
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.460]   Session is a beautiful print
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:10.700]   That you just wouldn't get anyplace else. Yeah, right and you know part of part of great photography is
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:16.780]   Things being kind of valuable and special right if I take a thousand makes a special
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:22.220]   I think for sure I think so for sure and you'll probably more likely to keep it if you like right, you know a thousand photos
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:26.420]   On your iPhone, you know the problem with that really is devalues a little bit
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:29.980]   Yeah, not a little bit. Yeah a lot. It's lost in the clutter
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:34.780]   But don't you find it frustrating that you have to kind of meter it and
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:40.740]   Think about it and you don't know if you got it till you get home. Isn't that difficult especially after using digital?
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:43.580]   For so long. There's a lot of non-obviously
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:48.780]   Wonderful things about it. One of them is I don't like normally I come home and I have to process all day long
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:50.740]   It's nice. You could pop it in an envelope. Yeah
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:55.900]   Well, I just let the film pile up and then I get 20 of them I mailed them in right you can't really post process them very effectively
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:43:01.460]   Oh, you can't oh that's interesting. So you don't pop them in a lightroom and make them much better. They're kind of done
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.940]   interesting
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:09.540]   And then the other camp I mean I basically have stopped using my SLR except for very specific
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.540]   photo
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:15.660]   Situations like you like them the mirrorless well this I'm a I'm a Sony a7 fan
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:22.900]   I have this is a 7 this is a 7 R2. Yeah, I love it. I mean it's it's the same. That's the same
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:28.740]   Sensor is in your d8 10 basically. Yeah, no better. It's a little bit better
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:33.860]   But it's a bit Sony sold and then if you really want to do something special. This is my nice lens on there
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:37.380]   This is my oh, this is the knock to look. This is my go-to killer
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:44.380]   So this is a point get this so you know that f2 is fast and f1.2 is really fast
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:46.980]   So this is f0.95
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:53.160]   Which means but you want to turn off the lights before you could take a picture well you get some size of that
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:57.420]   I don't move well, you know the depth of field is incredibly hard to focus
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:01.820]   Yeah, I have to look right at your eyes through and it's manual focus too, but you actually want that
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:05.420]   You look for a manual focus because you can't
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:11.340]   You can't you know plant you know yeah, I know it is been there done that oh, that's beautiful
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:13.340]   You know I love the creamy bokeh
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:18.080]   And the color is kind of muted. It's kind of interesting is well. There's some interesting lighting in here
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:23.780]   Yeah, I like that, but you know that pop. I mean that's a special kind of photo right it sort of pops
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:30.380]   Yeah, and well, you know this is what I hope for everybody who's getting into photography is that they don't worry about the
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:33.460]   10,000 shots they worry about the 20 shots that they love this year
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:38.020]   Yeah, that's my problem is I have too many shots. I don't know what to do with them all
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:43.980]   It's just it. I don't have time to sit down and go through them all you know the business that I would start if I was starting
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:48.500]   Another company would be to do an annual like you had in your high school like you got your your book
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:52.500]   Everybody should get a yearbook for their year. Yeah of the few photos that they really care about
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:57.860]   I mean not only for themselves, but like in future generations, you know, do you think we're gonna have Facebook photos?
[01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:00.860]   No, get them printed an acid-free paper
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:04.940]   I'm saying and put them in a book does blurb do archival prints?
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:09.260]   They do very very high quality. I can't tell you if it's archival right very high quality
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.860]   But that's what you'd want though if you're saying well
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.420]   I want this for you actually generation well somebody that was talking to yesterday
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:18.500]   They were saying that there should be a service where you mail it to like the National Archives right your family
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:22.540]   Album I'm gonna tell you the truth though Christopher. You don't have kids do you? No?
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:29.480]   My kids they don't care they care and when I'm dead they might there might be one or two pictures
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:37.420]   They're just as likely to look at my old Facebook postings as anything else and most of the stuff that I've taken over these years and carefully cultivated
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:39.300]   They're just gonna throw it out
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:45.460]   Let's be honest. You don't believe that I totally believe we we fool ourselves into thinking future generations
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:48.460]   Give it give it rats behind about what we're doing
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:50.260]   Only we care
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:56.460]   Do you don't have any relatives pictures you look at you go? Well, that's pretty cool. Yeah, but you know one of the things at school is there's like two
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.820]   right
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.260]   There's like two
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:08.580]   Daddy Leo had 85,000 pictures of every bit of his life meticulously documented in sort of movie
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:14.460]   Christopher Michael, I don't know if it's appropriate to say happy Veterans Day
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.900]   Happy Veterans Day
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.460]   and are you gonna do you do anything special do you
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:23.380]   remember comrades or anything well, it's funny all my
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:28.220]   Shipmates, you know comments and people comment and people thank me and you know I just tweeted about this
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:33.820]   I'm always embarrassed when people thank me for my service because honestly I loved every minute in the Navy
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:38.140]   Yeah, I mean I should be thanking everyone that's listening because it was super super fun
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:45.540]   You know really like every day it was like you can't me do do this. Yeah, that's great. Well, we still thank you for your service
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:51.860]   And every man and woman in the armed forces well a lot of people are sacrificing a lot more than I've there's some big sacrifices
[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:55.220]   But so even if they're having fun, that's fine that we appreciate what they've done
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:47:01.720]   And that's a good thing. I'm so glad you could be here on Veterans Day or Remembrance Day or Armistice Day or whatever you
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.720]   Coincidence? I don't know
