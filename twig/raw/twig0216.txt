[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400]   there's no Leo here this week. He's having a wonderful vacation on some
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.960]   gondola singing and having pizza. But we do have Gina Trapani, the wonderful
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   magnificent Gina. Hello Gina. Hey great to be here. That was a good intro Jeff. You
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720]   can tell we've been doing this for a while but that delivery was it was as if
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.520]   Leo were here. And we are both relieved and delighted to have Aaron Nukem in the
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.880]   studio so it doesn't look so strange. There is a real human being. You can
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.160]   pinch him. He's he's flesh's normal tone. He's real. He's all right. I'm a rose
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.360]   between two thorns. I mean a thorn between two roses. Now it's great to be here.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   Thanks for having me guys. And we have Chad of course in the control seat.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.000]   Thank goodness we only mess up. Good to see you Chad even though we don't see you.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.800]   Show yourself Chad. Oh there we go. There we go. Sorry. It's a little bit.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.360]   It's a good Christmas. Yeah it's good as Christmas Eve. Chad was going to show us
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.680]   Leo's environs. Yeah this is what Leo's up to. Lisa was taking pictures from
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.360]   that nice little chili though. We're clearly having way more fun here. Oh of
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.920]   course. Yeah who wants to be there? Look at those buildings. They're so beautiful
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.640]   and old and yeah not at all interesting. Yeah man camera is Lisa have that's a
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.400]   good that's a good shot. Yeah if you're on her cell phone I'm gonna be really
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.240]   impressed. I believe she's using the Olympus OMD camera. Very nice. Very
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.840]   very nice. So by Leo by Lisa we miss you but what the heck well life will go on
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.720]   without you. Here we are and this week I got some good news I thought. I got my
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.600]   Nexus 7 LTE. I've been waiting for it for weeks but way for it to go on sale. I
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.120]   finally got to order it last week. It didn't arrive before the show and here
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.800]   it came on Friday and I was. And all your dreams came true. Right Jeff? No.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.760]   Here we go. Watch out. All your dreams. Hey Jeff you waited so long for this
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.840]   for this tablet to buy it to get it. You have it now. This is it. This is
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.600]   this is what you've been hoping for. I know you're a picky guy. You have very
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   high standards. You've got specific things that you want and it now it's in
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.120]   your hands. What's wrong? How's that LTE working? Yo.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.040]   So so I am going psychotic on Verizon because Verizon will not hook up
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   my Nexus LTE. Now you remember when it was announced months ago Google said it was
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.800]   going to work. The first device that was going to work on AT&T T mobile and
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.040]   Verizon on LTE. Wow. There was a slide. See incoming weeks. Verizole right there.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.000]   And so I walk into the Verizon store on Saturday and I say hi. I want to give
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   you more money. I want to add this to my shared data collection there right.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.880]   Well one snolly little smart ass clerk came over and said you can't.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.680]   You can't. It doesn't work. You can't. I said no no no. You don't understand.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.000]   I looked up things on the line. I said look Verizon LTE this device.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.520]   Yes. Yes. Yes. So I got a nice clerk and I got a manager over as I glared at the
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.720]   other clerk and they tried to put in the IMEI for this device.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.120]   It wouldn't take it. It wouldn't take it. All around. So they said well maybe it's
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.560]   just not ready yet. They said they've had months how ridiculous. But this happened
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.120]   with my Chromebook Pixel too. Where I went in and tried to get the deal,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   the $10 a month deal that they had and it wasn't in the skew in there and I
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.960]   figured okay so they messed up big old Verizon. Well they're not rich enough but fine.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.440]   I have them call Verizon HQ. They try to do so they can't do it either.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.600]   I figure okay this is frustrating. I'm mad though I leave calmly. I leave with
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.960]   smile on my face. I say thanks for your help guys. I get back home and of course I go to Twitter.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.760]   And I say oh VZW support. I need your help again. Can you get my device hooked up because I want
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.960]   to be a happy customer. I wait until days and then I get this response. So you can put it back up
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.200]   again Chad. I'm excited you got your Nexus 7 but not all LTE tablets are created equal.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:08.240]   It's not part of our lineup and can't be activated. I'm letting it sit there like the turd it is.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.520]   So I have psychotic fits all around and then people remind me that Verizon got the LTE
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.760]   spectrum C block as it's called a block C rather in the 700 megahertz band on the condition
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:31.600]   which Google managed to push into the spectrum auction the condition that it be open. And Chad
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.560]   if you could go back to and you see that block first block quote that it must be offered
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   that no licensee quote shall. Sorry licensees quote shall not deny limit or restrict the ability of
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:52.960]   their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licensees C block network
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.920]   except in so far as there's technical problems or other regulations or statutes right. No problem.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:05.360]   Well this is a device that has been approved by the FCC. This is an LTE device. It works on
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.920]   AT&T. It works on T-Mobile and I have a SIM for T-Mobile by the way because it came with the device.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.440]   Nice deal one month free. Thank you very much. Everybody is saying why should you talk up to
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.600]   you now mobile. Well because number one I have a shared device account on Verizon thanks to my
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.680]   Chromebook Pixel Google how could you have made this a Verizon only device. My family has their
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.960]   iPads on Verizon. What can I do about that? And so it's going to cost me more if I use this on
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.400]   T-Mobile or something else. And plus there's just the justice of it. The justice of it.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:49.040]   By God Verizon you will connect my Nexus 7. So I go around and I'm about to end this here. I go
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.920]   around and around. I go a lot on Twitter. A lot of folks come in. Huge response on Google Plus
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.960]   and on Twitter to this. People saying yeah why don't you learn Verizon sucks. Verizon's awful.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.240]   Go to T-Mobile. T-Mobile's better and I keep on saying no I'm going to force them into it.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:09.920]   And then nice folks at Free Press sent me their complaints to the FCC more than a year ago.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.840]   And last July the FCC had a consent decree against Verizon for $1.25 million because Verizon at the
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.720]   time was forcing Google to take applications that had tethering out of the play store.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.800]   That's not open. And so Verizon was told you have to do this and Verizon said oh yes we will.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.720]   And when earlier when Google had complained about Verizon's behavior and said a very tough
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.360]   letter Verizon got back and said oh Google how can you you're just being catty no no no we are
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.640]   going to be open of course we're going to be open. Look at all the ways we're going to be open.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.720]   I tried to find that full post which has been quoted on our as technical but of course Verizon
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:49.520]   has erased it. So this goes on and on and on and around and around. I then get another tweet from
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:57.200]   Verizon saying once again or the technical equivalent thereof. And so today I wrote and sent a formal
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.280]   complaint to the Federal Communications Commission enforcement division saying go after ambassadors.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.680]   And so I'm not going to rest. I am not going to rest until we bring Verizon to justice because
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.240]   this was the whole point of the notion of openness is that we have the choice. We have the control.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:23.840]   And Verizon take that. Good for you Jeff. Good for you. I love that you wrote a formal letter
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.800]   complaint because you know you can go back and forth on Twitter but that's it's 2013 to El-Hel.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.440]   Yeah yeah I want to rename it Del-Hel to Tell-Hell now.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.120]   It's just absolutely ridiculous. It's galling and the attitude they have. So Verizon PR didn't
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.200]   respond to me for days and then finally after I posted it they came back and they sent me a link
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:53.120]   to their certification requirements. But the problem is if I go by a phone here that's unlocked and on
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.920]   GSM and I go to Europe all I have to do is put a CIM in it and it works. There's no certification.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.360]   There's no this. There's no that. I've taken my Nexus 40 Europe before it was sold there and no
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.560]   problem it just works. That's the point of having an open standard which is what GSM and LTE are.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.920]   Exactly. On Twitter have said. That's exactly right Jeff. I mean these are protocols right. I mean
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.480]   all you have to say is I adhere to the protocol right. So I've enabled the chip in my device
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.200]   adheres to whatever the standard is whatever the protocol is and it should just work. That's
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.760]   why these things exist. That's the whole reason people do these things come up with these protocols
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.360]   and there should be no there should be no question about it right. And I think that's why
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.760]   that's T-Mobile's whole value prop right is bring bring your own device just come and it should work
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.240]   and use us and don't worry about Verizon and all this crap that they send your way.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.080]   The other thing is I wonder how much of this is because they don't have crap where I loaded on
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.920]   on the Nexus 7. I wonder if they're trying to hold up to see if they can.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well that'll leave that in. The second tweet I got from Verizon support when they said no no no
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.360]   it can't be activated. They said here's a link to all the nice things will sell you instead of
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.680]   the thing that you brought. So that's consumer fraud that's bait and switch that's a big problem.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.920]   And by the way when they say it can't be activated that is a bald faced live
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.960]   horizon because I did take the sim out of my Chromebook Pixel. I did put it into the Nexus 7 LTE
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.640]   and guess what? BOMO it does work. So it's not a question of can't work can't work on the network.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.520]   It's a question of Verizon won't let it work on the network. And this is Verizon's control.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.240]   It looks like Verizon posted a statement about this today. Virgil just posted it in the chat
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.400]   room. I put it under your rant on the rundown of Jeff. "Staven of Verizon Wireless Device Certification.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.360]   The Google Nexus 7 is not yet a Verizon 4G LTE certified device though it entered our process
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.000]   in August and we expect it to be certified shortly. Once the device is certified we will work with
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.240]   Google to enable the device to be activated on a 4G LTE network." That's such a bald faced
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.880]   live right there because again it already works on the network because that's the standard.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.320]   Aaron just said you can put it in there. The Verizon won't do is give me a sim and put it on my account.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.760]   So there's no matter a certification here that's that's horse poopy. Yeah they're saying that
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.120]   their testing protocol is the most rigorous of any carrier and it's focused on guarding the
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.400]   safety and security of their network done by third party labs. It takes four to six weeks.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:29.360]   Interesting, interesting, pot thickens. Four to six weeks. So what did you guys say about it on
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.200]   Elle and Android last night? Oh we were just we were relishing the thought of your rant today.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.280]   I was promoting through it because I said you get to hear about Jeff's healthy experience and we
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.880]   we pulled up your post on the on the show. I thought I was rather reasonable. I kept
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:54.000]   a less than usual pink face. Yeah, that was a good one. It was a good one. I love the
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.760]   uphile the formal complaint with the FCC and I bet that this statement by Verizon,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.160]   it looks like it was published today in 18 that doesn't have a time. So absolutely prompted by that.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.320]   Did you guys look at the certification process that they take a look at it? It's ridiculous.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.040]   Well here's the thing I mean so they have if you go to that that link that you just put in there
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.640]   Gina and then click on and go down under the certification process. Yeah go to that open
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.520]   network of Verizon that guy and then under the little wrench there there's certification process.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.680]   That's what I'm looking at right now. Yes. View our certification. So they've got four steps right
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.960]   review pre certification which is conditional. What does that mean? Then they've got certification
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.560]   which they test rigorously in our labs but they say they can test the device live over our network
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.400]   and see if it works and then look at the last one. This is what I was getting at before. Go to
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.280]   market. Why do they need go to market in a technical certification? We build external and
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.040]   internal awareness of your device through joint public relations in the use of the
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.720]   Verizon certification logo training our sales teams and listing your device in the device showcase.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.040]   So what they're saying is all that stuff has to be done before it's technically certified. We
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.320]   have to train our sales teams and do all this stuff. I mean that's a bunch. I understand one,
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.880]   two and three. I understand review, pre certification and certification. I don't understand why they
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.560]   need go to market to say that this is technically certified. But why not people on me if it's if
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.680]   it's a CDMA device which is what Verizon normally is of course then it has someone explained to me
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.640]   in Twitter. I'm sorry I can't give you credit because I can't remember your silly Twitterer
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.400]   handle that has you know root access to the device. It is a security matter. But as you said a few
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.680]   minutes ago Aaron this is a protocol. This is an open standard protocol. So you know I could go
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.320]   make a phone at my workbench and as long as I do it to the standards and I put a sim in it's
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   going to work. Verizon can't stop that. And that's the irony of all this. Verizon doesn't
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.080]   understand that they've entered an open world. This is the first time they've really worked.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.360]   It is the first time they've faced I think an open GSM device on their network.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.200]   And this was the condition. I can't repeat this often enough. This was the condition of them
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:07.120]   winning the auction to get the LTE 700 megahertz C block spectrum that they got. And remember that
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:14.640]   Google entered into that auction not to win but to put the pressure on to have the assurance that
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.920]   open devices would work. Why? Because clearly Google saw this very day coming. And here's the
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.560]   day here. Now mind you there's another issue here. Google has been silent about this. I'm a little
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.360]   upset about that. I've emailed Google PR but of course the problem is that Google love them
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.600]   dearly. Have a show about them. Write a book about them. The one time they get in trouble is when
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.880]   they do deals with telecos. And they've done devils deals with Verizon and I'm sure they don't want
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.800]   to piss off Verizon too much. But what's happening here is Verizon and Google are tweaking each
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:51.200]   other and we are stuck in the middle. Yep. It puts the users in the pinch. Absolutely.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:58.800]   So well, can you you could pop in the T-Mobile sim and get your first free month. And in theory,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.720]   if what Verizon is saying is true, which I know you don't think it is true. But while you wait for
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.040]   response to your official complaint and while Verizon reportedly goes through its certification
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.480]   process, maybe by the time your your free month is up, it'll it'll work. Yeah. And I'm you know,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.240]   I thought of doing that. But right now I'm trying to stay true to the principle of this. I'm just
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.800]   going to keep on forcing Verizon to to do what they're supposed to do under the law. And other
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.680]   people said, well, if you just take a sim out of something else, but in there it works. But it's
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.480]   fine. But then my my. Then you know, the seminar, crypto pixel. Yeah. Yeah. Now they also the
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.160]   nice guy in the store said, well, the only workaround I can really do is I could try to get a sim going
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.720]   and a phone and put it in there. But then the problem is that in the billing system, I'd be
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.920]   paying $40 a month and send a $10 a month for adding it. Right. So this is all about business
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.280]   conditions and Verizon control. It has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with technology, certification,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   any of that AT&T and T-Mobile are not idiots. They have much experience with GSM much more than
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.240]   Verizon. They are happily running this. Now Google, by the way, when it came out with this device a
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.600]   week ago, they sold it with a T-Mobile sim that lasted about a week. And then they went, they took
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.280]   it down for a day or for part of a day and everybody got suspicious. Then it went back up and a bit
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:24.800]   later, they offer it now without a sim with the T-Mobile sim or with an AT&T sim. But notice not a
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.680]   Verizon sim. So here I am. I'm trying to give Verizon business that Google is promoting to go to
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.240]   others. I'm trying to give them money. And the only thing that's happening here is in some freakish
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.640]   horrible anal control game that this corporation has to not let customers ever win anything.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.200]   For Verizon, the truly evil company, the company that hands over all your metadata,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.280]   the company that by the way we found out this week from the Guardian, phone companies never even
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.760]   tried to protest handing all of our data over to the NSA. A Verizon executive this week also called
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:02.160]   Google and Microsoft and Yahoo and Company grandstanders for fighting the NSA for our rights.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.520]   This is a company that does not give a damn about us as customers. This is a company that
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.800]   still thinks it's mobile and has a monopoly and can tell us to go below. Well, guess what people,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.160]   we've got Twitter, we've got Facebook, we've got fax machines, yeah, I had to fax it to the FCC,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:27.440]   and we are not going to rest. Good for you, Jeff. Best of right there. All right. All right.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.640]   That's what anything else to say about that, Rant, anything in the chat room going?
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.840]   Well, I think the only thing in the chat room that I noticed is you were talking is there is a,
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.560]   you know, the only legal out they have from what you were saying is that there is a clause in there
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.600]   that says if a device could harm the network, then they can, then they can. So then that's their
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.960]   claim. Then there's a burden of proof on that. Yes. There's a burden of proof to show it
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   for harm is network. And it's not harm in AT&T. It's not harm in T-Mobile. It's not harm in GSM
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.920]   networks around the world where, of course, it was available before it was available here,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.160]   which was the subject of another Rant Y. France had it. We didn't. Maybe I now understand why.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.400]   Maybe this has been a behind the scenes thing. I don't know. I am eager for Google to say something
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.960]   about this in public. I have, I've gone to their public policy people and to their PR people,
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.280]   and we'll see what comes out and I'll report all of this.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.880]   Who's for you? Yeah, good for you. Yeah, forget that T-Mobile Sim. Stick for the principal. Let's,
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.760]   put the screws to him. Yeah. Yeah. Have you, has anyone else, have you found anyone else on
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.800]   Twitter or just sort of out and about complaining about the same thing? Have you been to sort of
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.920]   get? I've found a lot of people who get a few things. Some who just took a center from another
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.480]   device and before I did it showed to me that, "No, Jeff, this works." And they demonstrated it to me
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:48.640]   very quickly. Nice. In fact, while I was in the Verizon store, I went to Twitter immediately,
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.440]   while I was there and I said, "I'm having this problem and I don't have anything." And immediately
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.160]   someone came back and said, "Well, I just took this. I just got the device. I took the SIM out of
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.000]   it. I put it in there. Oh, it works, Jeff." So I got to be able to say to Verizon, "No, this works
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   on your network. Here's the proof." That's, that's amazing. That's the beauty, the beauty of all this,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.040]   which also, by the way, always comes back to the power of Leo, to the power of Leo.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.560]   Absolutely. Because I don't have those kind of followers there except for this wonderful show
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.120]   and network. So that worked. A lot of people on Google+ have been saying, "I was thinking about
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.240]   getting put on Verizon. I'm not doing that now." And a lot of surprising number of people, Gina.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.960]   This is a trend that I haven't seen. Leo's been talking about how, you know, T-Mobile's pretty
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.640]   good. T-Mobile's going to run here. You know, T-Mobile's fine. And what was happening on, on Google+ is
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.840]   that the number of people who said, "To heck with Verizon," not just because you have the SIM,
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.080]   T-Mobile's actually good. They have unlimited data plans. They care about people. I have a good
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.800]   customer service. It was like 90% in favor of T-Mobile in this whole discussion. 10% of people will
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.920]   complain. It's the opposite. Where it's 95% complaining about Verizon and a few hangouts
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.720]   trying to defend Verizon. Hmm. So were people saying, "I'm just going to switch because I can't,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.160]   I don't want to deal with these people at all." Because switch to T-Mobile in general. Yeah.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.080]   Yeah. Good. And that's where, I mean, you got to follow the money, right? I mean, that's what's
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.400]   going to eventually get Verizon to take notice of this as if people start leaving. I think that,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   thank goodness for Jeff in his reach, right? His virtual reach out through the ether,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.040]   so to speak, to people. Because if it were just like a normal person that had this problem,
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.200]   I mean, no one's going to notice, right? So thank goodness Jeff's making it. Because,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.640]   let's face it, I mean, how many customers are actually trying to do this? Probably not that
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.120]   many at this point, right? So it's not like someone pulled one of Verizon's key devices and says,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:39.040]   "Hey, this doesn't work." And it affects 80 million people, right? So this probably affects a small
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:45.120]   subset. And it's the small minority that doesn't have any voice really. So thank goodness for Jeff.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   Thank goodness you're raising this up. Well, it's a very small concern. It's a very small audience
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.640]   for this. But yeah, there's some level of responsibility that you have this platform like Twig and the
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.800]   blogs and such that rather than just surrendering, because people said, "I just give up." And I said,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:08.960]   "No, I can't. I won't do that." So on we go, "All right, I need a break. I need something happy.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.680]   I need positive change in the world." You know what I need? I need a change log.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:28.160]   The Google Change Log. We've got a few new things in the Google first this week. First,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.680]   we'll kick it off with Google Plus. It gets new photo editing tools with Snap Seed. So while
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.360]   you're viewing your own photos on Google Plus, click on the Edit button. You're going to get new
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.480]   features like Auto and Hands, which we've seen already, the Auto Awesome. Selective Adjust makes
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.040]   you let edits to specific parts of the image and filters like vintage and drama. You've got to
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.320]   have your filters. These are all powered by Snap Seed, which was originally a really cool iPad app
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.960]   and later an Android app. And now we're seeing it kind of on the desktop for the first time. And
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:03.840]   yeah, Chad is showing us some of the new features there in the video. They're selective adjust. Very
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:11.440]   nice. Very cool. You only draw back using all these features in Google Plus requires Chrome.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.280]   But everyone listening to this show probably already uses Chrome. So that won't be a big deal.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:22.080]   It's really neat. I've used it. One of the things that Charpe's asked is there's missing
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.440]   basic things. Like if I want to put a line on the photo or put some text on a photo or any of that,
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.360]   I couldn't find any of that. It was a bit on. There were some things missing.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.480]   Right. Right. Right. Right. So you can't actually like annotate something or draw on it.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.280]   Not that I could find unless the chatroom will correct me within 30 seconds.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.240]   If they don't, then I take it as victory. Yeah. You know, honestly, I haven't tried that.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.960]   I mean, most of the stuff on Google, I normally do that with screenshots. And I use like
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.400]   Skitch or something else like that for that. But I haven't tried to do a whole lot of annotation
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.200]   or text on top of images. And that seems like a very basic feature. It surprises me that's not
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.920]   available. Yeah, it's there. It's in Google Plus. I just thought I think it's a where and where.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.840]   If you go to Google Plus and click on one of your photos, because they they rolled this out
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:17.280]   a while back because people wanted to do memes. Yeah, exactly. Like memes and things like that.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.120]   Exactly. So I know, I know that I've done it before on Google Plus. Let me just.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.480]   I think it's gone now. That's what I'm trying to say. That's odd. I'm going to try it right
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   now. Go ahead, Jean. I'm going to I'm going to try this. I'll report back. Okay, cool, cool.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:37.520]   Google Voice made a little change to secure your voicemail access. So you can call your Google
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.920]   Voice in order to retrieve your Google Voice voicemail. But now you need to either do that from a phone
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.160]   number, which you have registered with Google Voice, or you need to provide that phone number
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.280]   or a pin number when you call from another phone. You can create a pin lock that's up to 10 digits
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:56.160]   long, or you'll have to type in one of your registered your registered phone numbers in when you when
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.560]   you check your voicemail. Google Wallet had got a really nice upgrade that makes it much more widely
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.680]   available across Android devices and versions. And you don't need NFC to use it anymore. So
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.760]   while it'll be available for all devices running Android two, three and up regardless whether
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.800]   or not they got NFC, that's because Google has kind of broadened what what wallet can do.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.240]   It's it's adding indirect money transfers. So with the new update, you can transfer cash to
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.320]   anyone with with an email address in the US. Once you've linked a bank account to the service,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.400]   that's makes a lot of sense. Of course, Google wants to get more more more accounts, more active
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.840]   Google Wallet accounts going on. So I've had pretty limited interactions with wallet. I mean, I use
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.880]   it to because I sell an app to the Play Store and some of the back end is there. But now that you
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   don't require NFC and it goes back to older Android versions, I'm sure we'll see while it
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.440]   become a little more a little more widely available. But it would be nice to have an alternative to
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:58.800]   PayPal, which you know, like does it go? Does it like PayPal goes into the PayPal account? In the
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.320]   case of this, does it go into a Google account or does it go straight into your bank?
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.960]   I set it up to go straight into my bank. It used to be Google checkout and then Google checkout
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.720]   wallet merge. So I have to go into wallet to see sort of transactions and purchases and refunds
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.160]   and that kind of thing. But I do have it set up and honestly I set it up so long ago. I don't
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.080]   even remember I don't remember the details, but it does it does do a direct deposit into my
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.640]   directly into my bank account. So I did link I did link my bank account and I've linked my credit
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.960]   card to Google wallet as well so that I can make purchases that's you know make purchases in the
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:38.160]   place door. Cool. Finally Google alerts which is one of those lesser known Google products,
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.640]   but something I really like. It's especially good for ego searches if you want to see when your name
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.600]   shows up on the web. It lost the option to deliver your search results for things that you you've
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:54.160]   set to get alerted about as an RSS feed. It lost that option when Google reader got shut down,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.480]   but that option has quietly gotten added back into into the product. So so when you go to Google
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.760]   alerts you can set up an alert for certain certain terms. So if I want to see every time somebody
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.000]   mentioned the word twig that's probably a bad example. Maybe this week in Google or twit on any
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.600]   web page I can get alerted via a feed and RSS feed that that features come back or you can do it via
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:22.400]   email as well. But that feed that feed option is back. So that's good news for those of us who are
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.280]   still still using RSS readers. What feed reader are you guys using nowadays?
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:33.920]   I've been using the old reader. I don't use it very often, but I use the old reader.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:40.240]   And actually for a while there it went away and then it came back. Yeah, it's it's it's still
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.160]   around. I don't use it very much though. I honestly get my news from social. Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:49.760]   Yeah. In fact, I've I used to use net vibes and I used to plug in all my RSS feeds into net vibes.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.400]   But I haven't used it much lately. I mean, ever since Google plus came out, I've been more and
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   more shifting towards getting my stuff on social in other ways like Reddit. So I use Reddit a lot
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.720]   more than I do RSS feeds from various sites. I just subscribe to a Reddit like, you know, r/android
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.400]   or r/opensource or Linux or whatever I'm interested in. And I find that that's a easier way to get
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.640]   that kind of information because it's filtered, right? It's not it's not just everything that a
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.480]   particular site wants to put up there. I do go to TechMem a lot, but for that I just go to the
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.920]   website. I don't so I I guess I don't use RSS feeds as much as I used to.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:30.080]   What are you using right now, Jeff? Feed these looking very good on on Android feed these beautiful.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.560]   It's really well designed, I think. And I'm it's actually so well designed to kind of come back to
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.880]   a little more RSS now. Mm hmm. Right. Aaron, did you have any success finding how I can
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.840]   photo I stand corrected you they did remove that feature. I guess I hadn't tried it since
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.000]   since the new photo editing stuff rolled out. So it is gone. In fact, I found a bunch of posts
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.880]   on Google groups and on the help forums and things like that people kind of ranting about,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.440]   you know, one person even said this is why I even use Google plus in the first place so I can
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.160]   add text to my photos, which I I don't know I kind of find hard to believe. But
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.800]   so yeah, people are upset about this and sure enough, it's gone. I couldn't find a way to get
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.160]   text back. So you're right, Jeff. How are memes going to survive? What are we to do? Oh, no,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:17.440]   we end up we end up the change log on the sad note after all. The confession confession bear
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.120]   will be awfully silent. There will be no confessions for confession, but I'll just be sitting next to
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:29.280]   a log. I really want to confess something, but I can't. I sometimes I feel like Google makes
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.880]   changes to things and just sort of just like, Oh, let's just take that out for now. And then it
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.480]   kind of, you know, it'll pop back in. It'll be a change log entry a few weeks. It's like, Oh,
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.920]   you know, text is back. I just feel like things change so much that they move stuff around,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.680]   half with the play store or two that they took out a bunch of features and then sort of slowly
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   about the add the Mac in. I don't know if that's about them just figuring out, you know, how many,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.320]   what people are using or what? I wonder if you can go into the Picasa web tools. Is that still
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.440]   around? Can I go into Picasa web tools and use? No, maybe use their tools to edit it and then it
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:04.240]   would show up on Google plus. I don't know how to try it. Well, Gina, life is an AB test.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.840]   Life is an AB test. Isn't it? Ain't that the truth?
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.560]   Is there anything else that changed log, Madam? That's all I got.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:24.640]   All right, on to Google news. I told Gina before the show that this was going to be
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.840]   explained this to me Lucy Week. This was some things I don't understand. For example, one thing
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.720]   I don't understand here is that Google swaps out my SQL and moves to Maria DB. What's that mean?
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.960]   Okay, so for what I understand and Aaron, you're going to have to help me out with this because
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   I know you're in the open source world as well. Maria DB, from what I understand, is a fork of
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:55.520]   MySQL, which is an open source database engine and that's managed by another group.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.080]   Actually, I've heard a lot about Maria DB. I've heard that it's very good.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.800]   So Google is migrating. It's MySQL systems over to Maria DB, the register reported,
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.240]   and this basically allows them to get away from Oracle backed open source databases. So MySQL is
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   maintained by Oracle. Yeah, exactly. But Maria DB, when I understand, is a fork of MySQL. So it is
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.920]   based on MySQL. Right. So what happened here is Sun bought MySQL back when I was before the Oracle
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.440]   acquisition. So when I was working for Sun, they bought MySQL, which was great. Everybody's like,
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:38.080]   yeah, this is okay. Some of the users were a little upset, but it wasn't Oracle yet. So it was like,
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.320]   okay, let's hope and trust that Sun's going to do the right thing with MySQL. And then Oracle
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.000]   stepped in and people just went, okay, that's it. So yeah, Maria DB is a fork of MySQL. It's
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.960]   compatible with MySQL. And I think that what's happened here is Maria DB is fine. And lots of
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.600]   people have been switching. Google's kind of, I think Google probably hasn't switched till now
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.120]   because they've been waiting for it to mature, waiting, make sure it's ready for prime time,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:08.160]   right? Because you can't just throw things at new software and hope it works. So I think that
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.360]   kind of data that Google deals with exactly. So I think that this is a huge boost for Maria DB.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.480]   I'm sure they're going to be talking about this all over the place because what it does is it
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.600]   sells people, Hey, look, if Google trusts Maria DB enough to use it, then you can feel free to go
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.680]   ahead and switch from MySQL to Maria DB to so, you know, this is a this is a and this isn't the
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.800]   only place where this is being done. The same thing happened with open office, right? Oracle said,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.640]   Hey, we got this from Sun and we don't really want to support it. We're not sure what's going to
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.120]   happen in the user community was really freaked out. And so Libra office came about. And now Libra
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   office is really the de facto, you know, open platform for documents and presentations and
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:53.040]   things like that. So, so this isn't without precedent. And yeah, Maria DB keeps getting
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.680]   more and more support. So I think users are going to continue to switch from MySQL to Maria DB.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.080]   And I can talk about that now because I don't work for Oracle anymore.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.480]   It's a huge, it's a huge YR one for Maria DB. That's a really good point. And Maria DB is
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.200]   is backed by Monty. Monty, we didn't. Sorry, Monty. I'm sure that I messed up your last name,
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.040]   but he he spearheaded the original development of MySQL. So you have sort of one of the original
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.000]   MySQL developers there. And Google has about five people working part time on Maria DB bug fixes
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.320]   right now, which is that's five people part time, five Googlers. There's more to get away from Oracle
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.480]   or is this that are there are some functional reasons why this is better? No, I think it's to
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.960]   I think it's mostly to get away from Oracle. I mean, there could be some functionality that
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.720]   they're looking forward to in Maria DB to implement. But I don't think Google wants to be tied to
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:46.240]   to licensing structure from another company. And plus it's just good community involvement.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.960]   I mean, five developers part time contributing patches to an open source platform like this.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.280]   I think it's awesome. Yeah, it seems like the reasons are probably more political than technical.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.600]   And I think that the version of MySQL that they were running was probably heavily modified for
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.440]   Google's purposes. I mean, Google's dealing with problems that mo you know, 99.9% of MySQL users
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.720]   probably aren't, you know, butting up against. But so I'm sure that they're sort of contributing
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.600]   some of those patches as well to Maria DB. But that's great for everyone. That's great for the
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.920]   community. But it does sound like they just wanted to get away from Oracle or just a
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:24.880]   better Crocker moment. Tell me there's a real Maria. I actually don't know more of the name.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:30.160]   That's a good question. I don't answer something. I'm sure there's no sure the chat room will
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.880]   tell us in a minute. I can't remember either what it stands for or why it was called Maria. I know
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:41.040]   that they had we had some folks from Maria DB on floss weekly. And I had thought that right
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.800]   around this timeframe that Leo might have done a triangulation. I don't know. I'm kind of looking
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.880]   around this. I don't know if anyone's here that knows there may have been a triangulation with
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.080]   Monty or someone in the chat room is yelling at us because it's not MySQL. It's MySQL. I know.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:01.280]   Maria DB is named after Monty's younger daughter Maria. There we go. That's cool. And I like this.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:08.720]   That's good. Yeah. I agree. It's so much better nerds to name your stuff after some, you know,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.280]   after a real human thing and not a crazy acronym. Well, that's not really there must be an operating
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.920]   system of the future named data. Oh, clearly. Or at least a web app. I don't know if I'm going
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:27.280]   to waste my time in an operating system. But sure. And every birthday could go up like a revision,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:34.240]   right? So 1.0, 2.0. Yes. Yes. And that is reached 1.0 today. She's one years old today. No way.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.320]   Why did you tell us that at the beginning of the show? What a happy note.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.520]   Yeah. So this this time last year it was a Tuesday. So it was the night before twig. And I
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.120]   hadn't told you guys that that there was that that my wife is pregnant. So I was at the hospital
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.080]   in the doctor saying this is going to happen tonight, which it wasn't supposed to. We were supposed to
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.440]   have another five weeks. And I was in a joyful panic. And then I think I emailed you guys like,
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.960]   I can't make the show tomorrow because I got some stuff going on. I'll let you all talk. I'll
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.760]   tell you more later. Yeah, I was on that episode as well. We were all like, Oh, congratulations.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:14.320]   Yeah. Cool. Well, congratulations again. At a 1.0. Thank you. I will tell me her birthday kick
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.600]   didn't say at a 1.0. Did it? Of course it's going to say that. Of course it is.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.440]   Of course, you know what happens then as the kid gets older and they realize what the version
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.160]   numbers mean, they're going to be looking for like minor revisions like, man, it's 1.5.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   It's 4.5.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.640]   Soon as you start some speaking full sentences, it'll be 1.2. Yeah.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.520]   Well, I'm going on. It's those moments where I'm five and a half. I'm five and three quarters.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.680]   Right. Exactly. Which lasts for quite a while. I was I was at an event some years ago. You can
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.480]   tell me years ago in a second. And it was a Murdoch corporate event that was brought into
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:57.120]   to moderate Nick Denton and Mark Zuckerberg. And one of the executives of news corp came up
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   afterwards and she was laughing. She said, I just asked Mark Zuckerberg how old he is and he said,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:09.680]   I'm going to be 23. I'm 22 and 7/8.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.360]   Oh, the Zach, you have to have a special birthday for Ed is pie birthday, I think.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:24.480]   Oh, definitely. Oh, we're yes. Pie day and her pie birthday are going to be right with pie.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.920]   Indeed. Well, since you mentioned mentioned contributing to open source, this is a minor
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:36.320]   note, but both Google and Samsung have soared into the top 10 Linux contributors. I don't think
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.680]   there's a much great surprise in there, but it's but it's about in the back for them, right?
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.320]   Yeah, that is nice. That made me feel good. I mean, yeah, it's good. It's good to see these
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.600]   companies with a lot of money and a lot of resources contributing back to something that
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.760]   everyone can use. I mean, I like that the number in this chart that ours Technica published here
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.080]   is a chart of the company and the rank of how many how many changes they've contributed and
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.040]   what the percentage is. I love that the first company is none. Like right, right? That like
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   people with no affiliation are making them most changes to Linux. That's awesome.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.720]   That's the community. That's the community, right? That's open. That's OSS at work. And
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:17.440]   Red Hat, of course, is the top one, but it was good to see Samsung and IBM appear, although IBM's
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:23.600]   above them, which is interesting. I think that Microsoft's contributions have definitely fallen off.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:32.080]   But yeah, a lot of these, the suspects you would expect Qualcomm and AMD and the Linux
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.800]   Foundation, of course, NVIDIA. Yeah, a lot of these companies are the ones that make the drivers
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   for either their products or somebody else's using their chips and other products and things like that.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.480]   A lot of these companies have committed to developing driver open firmware or
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   something that goes in the Linux kernel because they want people to use their products, including
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:00.080]   people that run Linux. And a lot of these are also in the embedded space, which a lot of the
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:04.800]   embedded products run Linux. So this really makes sense. And I think that's why Samsung and Google
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.560]   are a little bit different because these are device makers. They don't necessarily use the chips that
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.800]   all these other companies make. They don't necessarily make them themselves. Although Samsung,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.240]   you could argue that they do. But even inside a Samsung device, you're probably looking at a
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.040]   Broadcom chipset or something like that. And that's where typically those drivers get written. In
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.920]   fact, Broadcom's on the list as well. Also, I mean, just to play both sides of the fence,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.480]   Oracle is on this list as well down below Samsung and Google. And just above Broadcom.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.240]   So I don't want to completely bash Oracle if they're committing to open source Bravo.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:44.640]   Thank you very much. But yeah, so this is really interesting to see the device users,
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.760]   the software pure software writers, not necessarily for devices make it up this far in the list.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   So speaking of things, Google is changing. How's that for us for a slick segue? This is
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:05.600]   a big deal in my world. Google ad ID could replace the cookie. And I'm not sure I understand how
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.800]   this works. I haven't seen enough detail at all on this. But the idea is that it becomes a new
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:17.120]   identifier that becomes anonymous both ways. So it's anonymous. The user is better anonymized
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:23.200]   and given the assurance of anonymity in tracking for advertising. And then there's some reference
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.640]   in the story that the advertiser is also more anonymous, which wouldn't be so great because you
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:34.080]   want to know who the parties are who are doing this. I have no idea how this is going to work.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.480]   I don't know what the promise really is. But I think as I've often said on the show,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:44.640]   media technology and advertising companies all blew it by letting the cookie be demonized by
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   the Wall Street Journal. It's helped to get you. And so an improvement on tracking that gives
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.800]   greater assurance of consumer control would be a great thing. Do either of you guys have the idea
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:02.960]   how this could work? Unfortunately, the source of this and gadget article is USA Today, which I
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.520]   don't have very high expectations of tech. Like, you know, my first question is, what is the
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.280]   technical implementation of this? Is the implementation going to be similar to cookies? If not, is it
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:18.160]   going to be a browser standard? You know, it has to be. It has to be, right? But yeah, USA Today's
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:24.480]   I don't have a lot more information about how this is going to work. But you know, this might be
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.280]   more of a branding problem. Like the cookie has a huge branding problem, as you pointed out,
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:37.200]   Jeff, I don't know if I wonder if Google can make the ad ID, the anti cookie, like, you know,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.160]   this is an anonymous safe secure way for you to get better ads anonymously.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.120]   I don't know how many consumers are really concerned about getting better ads. But you know, I mean,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.680]   besides people who kind of think about it, like we do. But if the ad ID could be, you know, kind
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.800]   of positioned as the anti cookies, the anonymous secure way to do, to, you know, to track you or
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.120]   to watch you. I mean, that there's an opportunity there. And I wonder how different the technical
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:09.200]   implementation will be. And I do hope it's an open standard and not just an Android Chrome thing.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:15.120]   Yeah, in the there's a CNET article about this too. And they bill it as a proprietary identifier.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:20.560]   A proprietary identifier. So proprietary to Google.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:26.880]   Yeah. So so I guess they could make it a standard, but they would control the way it works.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   I mean, again, this is this is according to CNET, right? And maybe they got it. Maybe they don't. I
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.680]   don't know. Maybe they got the proprietary part wrong. But it seems like it would be in Google's
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.000]   interest to make it as open as possible to encourage adoption and not make something some part of
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.640]   it proprietary to Google. Right. Right. You both right. USA Today is not exactly our source for
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.440]   technology news. Yeah. But you know, and gadget did a post based on the USC today.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.840]   Of course, that's what we do in technology now is somebody reports that everybody writes about
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:05.120]   it is if it's the same, it's all back to the same source. So my fault, my fault for not noticing that.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.760]   By the way, USA Today, just to put throw this into the side parent that I'm going to USA Today
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:15.680]   is increasing its price to $2. And my smart ass tweet was that it wasn't worth the effort to
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.440]   bend over at the motel room door and pick it up. I'm not sure it's worth $2. But anyway,
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.920]   I just a joke. It's just a joke. Oh boy. Oh boy. A friend of mine is the publisher of it. So I'm
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:33.200]   just joking Larry. Just joking. He's so thin. I can I can I can shave myself with it.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:42.560]   Oh man. All right. I'm going to go get in trouble. So here's another explain it to me Lucy story.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:48.480]   Cyanogen mod who Gina often mentions and Leo talks about it. And I just want to talk about it.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.360]   I've never done it. I don't know how to do it. What's rude is you pull it out of the ground.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:57.520]   It's a potato. I don't know what it is. It now is a company with considerable venture capital
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:04.000]   backing. So what does this mean guys? What is this? What does this enable now? Cyanogen mod has money.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.440]   And one of the things I saw in the story is they are going to make it easy enough for idiots like me.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.880]   So what does this bring to the to the Android world and to say and I'm not itself. Do you think?
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.640]   This is really interesting. Like a team of Android rock star developers, including Steve
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:26.960]   Kondik and coach Duda are now they got $7 million in BC backing, which is a nice amount of money.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.680]   They've got small team. I think they're based in Seattle and they're going to be making cyanogen
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.800]   mod, which was a weekend project by hackers and enthusiasts for power users who are willing to
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.160]   to root and mod their phones. They're making this into a consumer product. This is really,
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.240]   really interesting. And I'm interested to hear what you think. I mean, for me, it's hard to say.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.160]   I haven't I haven't I haven't used cyanogen mod in a while. I've been kind of committed to running
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.960]   the vanilla Google version of Android because I'm interested in Google's direction for Android
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.520]   because Google has been such a clear leader on the development of Android. But what's interesting
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:08.640]   to me is that we see now flavors of Android getting developed based off the open source project,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.960]   which are kind of separate separate from Google. So we're seeing, you know, we saw that sort of
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.920]   sort of with Amazon and the Kindle, right? That was very Kindle specific. But now it's an Amazon,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   you know, creating this other mobile operating system that's based on Android, you have
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:27.840]   Hugo Barra at Xiaomi that the Chinese manufacturer, which also has has its own flavor of Android.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:34.160]   Now we're starting to see operating systems based on open source Android and customized in
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.880]   different ways. This isn't just like Google Android, you know, the Google version of Android with
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:46.800]   like an extra skin on top. This is like a different build of Android. And is that a problem of
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.520]   fragmentation, as they always say, is this mean that the world could get too confusing?
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:59.040]   Yeah, that's that's the new devices and things. Yeah, I mean, that's possible. I mean, it could
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.760]   mean that it could mean just just more choice in the way that Android and Android works.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.840]   It means that I think it means that that Google's competitive advantage actually is in Google Play
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.240]   Services and not in the, you know, the bottom layer OS code, right? Google Play Services and
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   the Google suite of services that live on top of Android is really where Google's competitive
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.040]   edges. So you open up a situation where other companies are going to start their own app stores
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.880]   like Xiaomi has and like Amazon has. And you know, maybe Cyanogen mod. Actually, there is there
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:37.040]   is a Cyanogen have its own. Cyanogen does have its own app store, doesn't it? Or its own way to
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.560]   get apps. So I mean, so again, you know, you have the black and white, right? There's more choice.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.120]   And yet there's sort of the the downsides of fragmentation. I don't know, Aaron, what do you
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.280]   think about this? So personally, I think it's about time, right? Like, I've always wondered why these
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.360]   guys aren't working for Google. And I think they've, they've, you know, kind of talked about that in
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.520]   the past. And they're actually doing a, or they did an AMA on, on Reddit this morning, the chat room,
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.880]   got that link up there. I mean, we can get it up for after the show. But, you know, it's,
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.320]   I think they've just reached critical mass, right? It's like, look what we can do, right? So when
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.960]   Kuz did that, I always say his name wrong, am I saying it wrong? It's coach. Coach, thank you.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.720]   I always do that. It's just the way it looks. So when Kuz wrote that app for
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.800]   Chromecast. Chromecast. That was like in less than a day or something. I mean, he had something up
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.520]   and working. And it's like that, I mean, that's gold, right? If you've got that kind of talent and
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.800]   you can do those kinds of things, then you need to be looking at ways to bring in more funding
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:43.040]   and market it. I mean, I mean, I, I, I really like the community aspect of C&D. And there's
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.400]   lots of other, if you go to XCA developers, I mean, there's lots of other people in communities
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.760]   working on this kind of stuff. They're not the only name in the game, but they are probably the
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.440]   biggest name in the game. And they've got a lot to offer. And I think people would be willing to pay
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:59.040]   for some of the services that they could offer. You know, you could, you could put their specific
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.000]   OS, you know, if they can make it really easy to put their specific OS on your device and offer
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.160]   support for that. So hey, I can't make something work. I'm willing to pay $5 a month to be able to
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.960]   call somebody and get it to work. Or, you know, particular apps that help you do something unique
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.920]   on your device that Google's not really doing and the, and all the other manufacturers
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.480]   with their specific OS's aren't doing. They did say as far as monetization, I'll just read this.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.680]   It's the number one question right now on the, on the AMA on Reddit. And they asked about monetization.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:32.480]   And, and they said, monetization is not an immediate concern. And our investors agree.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.880]   Sanja Mona has the potential to become an enormous platform play. And to do that,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.120]   we need to foster and grow the ecosystem. Right now, we just want to build something compelling
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.200]   and grow the user base. Eventually, there are innumerable paths to monetization.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.720]   Once we once we reach economic, sorry, economics of scale, licensing our software services to OEMs,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.080]   building hardware, creating secure enterprise solutions, etc. Creating disruption in a multi-billion
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:01.600]   dollar market is enough to make any investor raise their eyebrow. So, and I agree with them. I think
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.680]   that's where they're at. It's just like, Hey, we've got this really cool thing. Let's pick it up and
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.480]   run with it. And the fact that they were able to get $7 million, what seems like fairly quickly,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.640]   I think is evidence that investors would agree with them. Wow, good explanation guys.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.840]   And then what I'm going to, I just decided, when I finally do get my Nexus 7 on to Verizon,
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.840]   I'm going to root it and put on the worst bad new OS I can.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:30.240]   Good for you. My first bit of advice for cyanogen change the name.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.600]   Yeah, yes. Yeah. Pick a better name. Sounds like a poison that's fertilizer.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:44.080]   And, and, and just position, it has to be positioned as it's still, I still can't explain what
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.600]   cyanogen is in simple terms. I mean, is this going to be like Android for advanced users?
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.720]   It sounds like it, right? It sounds like this is going to be kind of the build for
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.560]   advanced users, but it needs a better name and it needs, it needs a better explanation than
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:02.080]   modified firmware. I just, not a lot of people know what that is. I think that they can do really
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.080]   well targeting the power user market. But if they want to extend their reach, even more than
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.960]   they already have, and I think what 8 million, 8 million people are running cyanogen, which is
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.560]   great. I mean, that's incredible for something that these guys have done that, from what I
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.320]   understand, kind of in their spare time. And they are, there are lots of people doing this, but they
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.600]   are, they have so many years of experience and they spend so much time doing this there,
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   the premier kind of developers. So use me again as a proxy for the idiots of the world.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:31.360]   And, and give me the three or four tweets and explain why someone would want to use a cyanogen
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:38.240]   one. So, so the first thing is, so the reason you want to use cyanogen,
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:43.360]   is to do things that, well, okay, number one, you don't want to be locked into what a particular
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:50.720]   vendor says you can do. So you say, well, I don't like sense. I don't like whatever Samsung's is.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.560]   I don't like this. I don't like that. I want something that looks like Google that works
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:00.080]   and that I can, that I can do things with and I'm not locked into what the vendor says or the
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.080]   manufacturer says, I can or can't do. So that's reason number one. And that's usually where people
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.680]   end up is like, I really want to do this on my phone and it says there's a way, but I can't run
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.440]   it because I don't have root. And so then they unlock their phone and they, and they root their
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.040]   phone and they can do what they want to do. That's where that's where most people come to it.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:21.440]   I think secondly, it used to be not so much with if you're running a stock Google device,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.560]   but if you're running one of the other carriers operating systems that they put on their phones,
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.680]   you want new features right away. So if Google comes out with a new feature or somebody comes
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:36.080]   out with a new feature, you don't want to wait for Samsung or HTC or LG or whoever it is to
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.840]   implement it. You want to run it right away. And theoretically, you can do that quicker on
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:46.480]   Sanogen Mod or with a stock Google phone now, then you could otherwise. Now that picture is
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.120]   somewhat turning around because now some like Samsung especially is developing their own software
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.480]   that's really cool that people might you might not be able to get that on Sanogen Mod. So we'll
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.880]   see where that goes. What else, Gina? What other reasons? Yeah, I mean, I think that you hit it
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.280]   while getting getting new releases, a new Android release is sooner, but also just I mean, from
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:12.160]   what I understand, Sanogen Mod just gets more new features more quickly, right? Like power
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.000]   kind of power user features. Like I just want a quick short talk to do this that other thing.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.280]   So not only just getting a whole new build, but like in general, it sounds like the Sanogen team
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:27.280]   listens to power users particularly more closely and is quicker to implement stuff that would suit
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.480]   a more advanced user than Google. Yeah, I mean, even simple things like being able to reboot your
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.320]   phone like a lot of phones, even my phone, I'm running a variant of stock Google on here.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:42.400]   When I hold down the power button, I get airport or whatever it is airplane mode and
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.000]   shut down. There's no reboot option. And sometimes what I want to do is I just want to reboot.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.720]   And so things like that, Sanogen Mod puts in by default, just nice power user. I wouldn't even
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.680]   say it's a power user. It's really just a it should be in every phone, right? Just hit the
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:00.000]   reboot. It's right disadvantage. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, you know, there's things like that. And
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.400]   I think that just with their expertise, this is going to be really interesting to see where they go.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.040]   But again, they're going to run into some troubles, I think, with the carriers because the carriers
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:15.360]   are, I would assume as they do now, they say, look, this isn't this isn't supported. Some devices,
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.840]   very few devices support unlocking. I'm sure they'll say, you know, look, if you run this, it voids
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.760]   your warranty. So there's going to be some roadblocks ahead for Sanogen Mod. We'll see where it goes.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.360]   Yes. I'm going to in the chat room says old hardware was the reason to run the mod. I mean,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:34.160]   it sounds like this is a way to sort of get around limitations. This is why this is sort of a thing
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.120]   that you did kind of an extra it's just interesting to watch. It'll be interesting to watch them
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.960]   make turn this into a legitimate consumer product and how they're going to negotiate.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.200]   And all those things are going to be small, whereas if it really becomes the parallel to
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.640]   Android development that will build things that Google doesn't feel like building company.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.160]   And so if you come along, you know, the next time Amazon can just hire them to write the OS.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.560]   Maybe maybe because they do mention OEMs in here in their response on monetization. So that may be
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.000]   that might be an angle that wants to have, you know, corporate devices that work a certain way.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.720]   You know, they can they can customize across a whole bunch of devices. Right. Right.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.280]   Yeah. Yep.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:25.520]   All right. A few other quick things on Google before we move on. This story struck me as
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:31.840]   it smelled the sweet smell of BS. Google or panic, I should say Google knows many of the world's
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:38.400]   Wi-Fi passwords thanks to backup defaults on Android devices. Well, yeah. So obviously when I
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.240]   when I store passwords for Wi-Fi on my device, whether that's a laptop or whether that's a device
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:49.760]   a phone, then there they are. And I guess there's some controversy that Google backs those things
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.120]   up the cloud. Well, that's a good thing for me because when I change devices, it's still there.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.400]   No big is this just a kind of am I missing something here? It just strikes me as your random
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.760]   hey, let's panic the world for this week. Yeah, I had the same reaction when I read this story.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:09.280]   It's like really like you didn't realize this already. And maybe that's who this is targeted to
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.400]   is the people that wouldn't wouldn't normally realize this, but it's not like they're not
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:16.720]   protecting the data. It's not like they're collecting. Google's collecting the Wi-Fi passwords and
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.600]   putting them up on some website somewhere for everyone to use. So also knows how many times I
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.080]   use the F word and email. I mean, I know they have that too. Yeah, exactly. I'm with you, Jeff. I
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.480]   didn't really understand why this was such a big deal and why why why the article made such a big
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:38.080]   deal out of it without explaining that, you know, all this information is still still protected. And,
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.760]   you know, it's really for the convenience of our users and people can turn off the backup function
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:47.360]   really easily with one click and settings. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, I kind of didn't get
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.320]   either. It smelled like the Oh my God, Chrome saves my passwords. And if I click on the show me
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.480]   what the password is, it'll show it to me story, which also seemed like
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:03.040]   seemed really, really strange. I assume that these backups are encrypted in some way so that
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:10.080]   they don't travel over the wire unencrypted Google can decrypt it on their end, I assume. I don't
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:17.120]   know. It just didn't seem like that big a deal to me. Good. I'm glad we erased that one.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:23.440]   Enough of that. You know, one more thing in here that I don't appreciate is they seem to be playing
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:29.200]   on people's fears and specifically, there's a there's like a bunch of stuff at the end of the
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.480]   article. There's like 10 facts or 12 facts or something. And they say here does NSA know your
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:40.560]   Wi-Fi password and right backups may give it to them. And it's like, come on, really, you're I mean,
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:44.960]   to me, this this really strikes of of someone just trying to
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.040]   dredge something up and make it a bigger deal than it is because I think we've got to call them on
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.240]   it. I think that's kind of techno panic stuff. We have to call them on it because it's easy and
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.400]   it's going to end up on the here's your tech minute on the morning, you know, network news.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:02.240]   Exactly. I exactly. We don't want fear mongering going on here. But it does happen.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.960]   Right. All right. Google has the keys to everything everywhere.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.840]   And fine, fine. I welcome my new master.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:15.680]   If only the master would tell me more and more often. So I went through this is my I'm getting my
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.840]   my day. So I went through weeks of complaining to you and boring you waiting for my Nexus
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:24.960]   seven LT, of course, you've now heard the latest chapter at the beginning of the show today.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.200]   What's the next thing I'm waiting for? The Nexus five. And the Nexus four, as everyone knows,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.920]   the price has reduced drastically a hundred bucks. And now they have sold out and they're not going
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.560]   to be back. So now we have the Nexus five rumors going hot and heavy. Any new insight from
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:49.760]   Android land, Gina? Tons of rumors. We got like 3D rendering that fans have put together based on
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   that, you know, that that snapshot from that video that Google put up and and the FCC documents.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.840]   Everyone's decided that that this LG Nexus five is going to happen. There's a rumored date,
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:05.600]   October 14, which is less than a month away from now. Yeah, I got to tell you, it sounds like
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.840]   I believe it. We're talking about last night on all, but Android, there's so many rumors and
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.480]   so much speculation and so many sort of morsels being released. And it's going to run KitKat,
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.680]   you know, that's going to have a few different upgrades. It's going to look like that that that
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:23.280]   shot in the video. It seems like given that this week is the iPhone release week that these are very
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:28.400]   well timed rumors and speculation. So it would have folks on that plastic phone.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:33.760]   Yeah, yeah, exactly. Look what's coming. Look what's coming. It makes a ton of sense. The Moto X was
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.920]   not the latest Nexus right there. They're going to the fact that they reduced the prices Nexus
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.720]   for the Nexus 4 is now sold out and they're not they're not going to restock according to sources
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.360]   close to Google. I've heard of course they're going to they're going to launch a new Nexus and
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   it wouldn't surprise me if it was exactly on the date that that is rumored, which is October
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.080]   October 14th and there you can see chat us up on the screen. This is a 3D rendering. This is
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.640]   this is based only on rumors and speculation. This was made by a fan. It was posted on Reddit.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.960]   But yeah, I mean, there it is, folks. I mean, it looks just like the one in the picture that we
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.520]   saw in the KitKat video, which I think was one of the sources and pretty believable, huh?
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:16.000]   I can't wait. I can't wait. And I'm not going to use it on Verizon. I was just going to ask that.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:23.200]   Not going to happen. All right. Here's a weird story before we leave Google Land.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:30.000]   Google surprises. You know, the the moonshot world that it is. Two things happen today.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.200]   One is that Google announced an investment in Calico, a health and well-being company. At the
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:41.840]   same time, there's a time magazine covered just out in which they asked the question, can Google
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:49.040]   solve death? I think the next time made the perfect time magazine cover is is Google God.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.240]   But Chad, if you point that up, you'll see the the cover on that one, right? Can Google solve death?
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:03.120]   And so there's a lot about about Sergey and the health concerns of the company and this and that.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.200]   It would be, you know, remember they got rid of Google Health, what about a year ago,
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:12.720]   when Larry took over or about that, I think. And it was never a well-formed concept. It was going
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.040]   to be able to share data. And that's pretty much it. Store your data and then share it with your
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.840]   doctors. But you know, where could Google go with health? That becomes a really interesting piece.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.560]   Yeah, it makes sense to me. I mean, if you think about, I'm a big proponent of clinical studies.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.720]   When people say, oh, such and such is related to something else, you know, because we looked at this
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.680]   and, you know, if you buy a pig, you're more likely to smoke cigarettes. It's like, what? So,
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.880]   a big proponent of clinical studies, but before you get there, right, and you can actually run
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.280]   tests on people, you have to form a hypothesis. And I think Google is uniquely positioned to
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.640]   provide and to mine some of this data that they're collecting from all of us to give to healthcare
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   professionals or to the healthcare industry to say, hey, look, we're noticing these trends between,
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.560]   you know, people that wear Google Glass and, you know, people that have improved vision or
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.920]   something, you know, I don't think that would happen to probably be the opposite. But, you know,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.120]   something like that, I think they're just uniquely positioned in the industry to be able to serve
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.760]   up some of this data. I don't think they're going to solve death. That's a good headline to.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.640]   That's a terrible headline. I mean, it catches your eye, but I mean, that's, I don't know,
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.600]   I think that's a little far time magazine becomes a parody of itself. Yeah, exactly. But, you know,
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.320]   but I mean, I think that I think the subtitle to that is good, which is the search giant is
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.120]   launching a venture to extend the human lifespan. How do you do that? You make people healthier.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:39.600]   That's really what it's all about. So it's about using data to identify trends, to do research,
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.960]   to allow people to understand what's really interesting. Aaron, yeah, I mean, I've talked
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.280]   about this before where if we knew all the instances of breast cancer and could thus perhaps find
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:58.640]   correlations in an open way and explore that with privacy protected, but with generosity feeding it,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:04.160]   then, you know, who knows what information we could get? And interestingly, I think it was
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.440]   University of Pennsylvania faculty or in a revolt. I saw a story last week because the university is
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.160]   went into a new system for healthcare, trying to reduce their costs. One of the things they're
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.480]   doing is they're putting out what really do seem like pretty invasive questionnaires to people,
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.000]   like, you know, are you having fights with your spouse and are you in high debt and this kind of
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.920]   stuff, which you say, why should you know this? But the company they hired without kind of looking
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.440]   at the questionnaire in detail is trying to find the correlations and express the correlations for
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.840]   things like high stress and thus health problems and thus the money that goes behind it. And if we
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.120]   can get past some of this nervousness about about the privacy and actually get to the value of that
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.040]   data, which is something that Google engineers will understand, there really could be lifesaving
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:54.640]   value there. Absolutely. Go ahead. I really like the focus on long-term thinking. Like, I think
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.840]   the media kind of struggles with the tension between Google's kind of spring cleaning, short-term
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:06.800]   focus, or rather, lower pages. And then the Google X kind of long-term moonshot kind of thinking,
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   there's a great quote in this article, which I might misquote. But basically, Larry said,
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.200]   we talk about curing cancer as this huge, incredible goal, and cancer is this tragic thing,
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.720]   and everyone knows someone who we've lost to cancer. But if we cure cancer, that basically
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.800]   extends the average lifespan. I think it's by three years, which honestly seemed low to me,
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.040]   but OK, let's say it's three years. He's like, we can do so much better than that. We can add
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:44.080]   10, 20 years to people's lives if we think bigger. And there's another part of the piece where he
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:49.280]   says, driverless cars, if we had taken the time to put the money and the vision into driverless
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.520]   cars 10 years ago, they'd be ready right now, but we didn't. And so we're doing it now, but we're
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:01.040]   behind. So it's this constant focus on long-term thinking and putting resources and money into
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:07.040]   things that matter. Out of focus on short-term monetary gain. And I think that this is Google
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.200]   setting a really good example for the rest of our industry. Of course, Google has more money in
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.080]   their bank than pretty much any other company in our industry. So there are very many companies
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:25.040]   that can make this kind of long-term commitment. But I think it's a great example. And if we see,
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.080]   if we start to reap the rewards of this kind of long-term thinking and long-term
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:34.720]   R&D, then I think that investors will be more likely to take a bet on it on smaller companies
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.440]   as well in the future. So I think this is a good thing for our industry.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.320]   I think it's a really, really important and good point. And the essence of this show and the
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.360]   essence of what we talk about is why do we admire Google and what makes them different.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.040]   And I think Aaron's point too is the value of data. If somebody in the chatroom just pointed
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.680]   out that I didn't mention the thing that Penn was that people who didn't answer the question
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:58.560]   would pay, I think, $100 more a month in premiums as a result.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:06.240]   But there's an economic value to this data and to acting on it. And we've got to grapple with
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.800]   that. It's a society. We've got to grapple with ways to not only increase lifespan,
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.160]   but then deal with the costs that are going to come along with that in health care, which are
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:20.640]   crippling. So I talked to the reporter, Harry McCracken, who did the story for a half an hour.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.400]   And this is the great thing about a timing content machine. So we went through all kinds of stuff,
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.920]   all about the moon shots and this and that. And all that ends up in the article is
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:34.960]   what a case, because this is some rewrite guy who does this. When it came to Larry killing off
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.280]   stuff, he was quote ruthless, end quote said Jeff Jarvis, this whole long thing.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.800]   He didn't even say it. He could just call it ruthless himself. But that's not what I had to say
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.320]   about Larry, but fine. That's time. That's what it is. There was a new editor of time this week.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.880]   And she was asked whether time would ever not appear in print. And she said, no, it'll always be in
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:01.280]   print. There was a, I just want to just want to point out there was a, if you listen to the TED,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:06.000]   I think it's called the TED radio hour or something like that NPR's been doing this series on TED
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.600]   Talks. And then they, they bring in the person that did the TED talk and do an interview.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:15.200]   So they did an interview with Sebastian Thrun on this topic. He's the one that kind of done a lot
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.480]   of work with autonomous vehicles. And of course, works at Google and now it is doing Udacity and
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.040]   all this stuff. But there's a great article, if you, if you have, or interview, if you want to listen
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.240]   to it, he talks about this exact point, like, you know, 10 years from now, it could be that we,
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.640]   you know, I forget how many, like, how many people die on a highway accidents, but it's like 80
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:41.120]   million or something crazy. And he said that, you know, 10 years from now, we could maybe not wipe
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.560]   that out, but certainly reduce it down to a lot less than it is now, if we have autonomous vehicles
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.040]   making these decision for us and avoid a lot of the distractions that we have when we're on the road.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.840]   And also avoid, you know, problems that other people are making. So it's not, you could be a
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.640]   great driver. Somebody else causes a problem and you get killed, right? So anyway, if you want to
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.160]   hear that, I would highly recommend it. It was very interesting. And it was exactly on this topic
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.960]   about, about Google solving death. Yeah, there's, there's another great part in the, in that time
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.440]   piece where they were talking about Google Glass and, you know, they were talking about how,
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.520]   how one of, one of the complaints about Google Glass is that there's this fear that people around
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.200]   you are being recorded and it doesn't really look good on your face. And I think it was page,
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.440]   it said something like, you know, we're not going to not develop a product because of
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.280]   social norms. That's not a good enough reason, right? Like, if we have a good, a good reason to
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.640]   make a product, like we have to think beyond, you know, the, the initial sort of discomfort
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.720]   around social norms, the fact that social norms don't exist around this thing and see where it goes.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.040]   He's like, I'm not proposing that Google creates or dictates new social norms. I'm just saying that
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.560]   that's not a good enough reason not to try something. And I was like, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.480]   Although, you know, it goes back to the whole Google island thing where back at IO, I don't
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.200]   know if you remember him saying that, you know, he wishes there was a, there was a safe space,
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.520]   like a, like a burning man type situation where you could try things that were, would be completely
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.480]   socially unacceptable or maybe even illegal in, in sort of real society, but that, that there
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:13.840]   should be a testing ground for that kind of thing. But I, I was really wacky at the time, but it was
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:22.160]   like, yeah, I mean, it makes sense. Right? I would certainly visit. I would visit in my,
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.960]   in my self driving car. In your self driving car. Yeah, you just program your car to take,
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:32.400]   take you there, take me, take me to Google island, take me to Larry's safe place. And then I'll,
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.360]   and then I'll lay back and take a nap till I get there. Yeah. There was, there was a story that
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.320]   I didn't put the rundown today of a, of a Google Street view car, different, of course, in some
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.240]   place like Indonesia, I forget where that hit three cars in one day. I was just, it was a sad case
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.000]   of the guy hit one car and they took the person to the, to the garage and he was afraid it was
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.880]   going to cost too much. So he left, he was too upset. So then he hit another car and they got a
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.520]   more of something, he hit another car and I'm waiting for somebody to say, ah, this is what
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.960]   Google will do to us. But it's just some poor schmuck. All right. On words to Twitter.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.200]   Twitter, we didn't discuss this last week. I don't think a Twitter. Oh, I'm sorry. There was
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.200]   one more Google thing. Well, I forgot this. We didn't mention this last week. Google plus
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.680]   hangouts. Now that because Leo is away this week, I'm using Google plus. Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:25.120]   Don't say anything. But, but hangouts have now added new features. So you can do things like run
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.960]   auditoriums on them and have questions posed and all kinds of neat new stuff. So I perhaps
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:35.600]   mentioned that before. Anyway, Twitter also in the meantime, since last week, um, filed for its
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:43.040]   confidential IPO under the new jobs act or part of this, you can file for an IPO secretly without
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.000]   revealing all the data yet. If you have revenue under a billion dollars and so everybody's guessing
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.480]   that they've done that also speculation about the value of the IPO to the various VCs like Union
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.480]   Square Ventures and Fred Wilson and also to have Williams, Bizstone and Jack Dorsey. I saw one
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.080]   estimate that Ev at the end of this end blogger sale and everything else would be worth $8 billion.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:15.360]   Wow. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Yeah. Good for him. For a guy, you know, if I hope so, because you know,
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:23.200]   Ev ran blogger literally in his kitchen. Everybody was gone. He was down to his last dime, trying to
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.320]   keep it going, believing there was something there. And if he gets a payoff like that, he's going to
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.680]   get a payoff like that. And I think he's changed the world twice and I'm all delighted for it.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.040]   I agree. Would you buy Twitter stock?
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:45.680]   I don't buy stock in the companies. I mean, if you're your rich uncle, uncle Louis comes to you
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.520]   and says, "Jana, you know all about this technology stuff. Do you think that the Twitter has a big
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.160]   growth potential in the future? Or have we already seen it? You know, is this a stock worth betting
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:07.440]   on in any case?" For the long, long term, yes. I think so. But not, I mean, not in the next five years.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.360]   Aaron? But you shouldn't take investing advice from me.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.640]   No, for me. No, for me, it'd be very quick. I mean, I think this is one of those risky purchases,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.480]   right? For a stock. I mean, if you're into the, if you have some money and you want to take a risk,
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.200]   then this might be something I would do. But I think it is a risk if you look at what's happened to
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:36.560]   things like MySpace and other companies that I think group on and some of the other ones. I just
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.600]   don't, I don't know. I think it's a risky bet, but I know there are people out there that like to
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:47.120]   take risks. And I think that this signifies a huge change for Twitter. Right now they're going to have
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.080]   to tell shareholders what they're doing and prove their value to shareholders and attract investors.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.280]   So, I mean, it's just a big company shift, right? First, you're doing all these things and that
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.640]   are really cool, technically cool. And we're making these decisions for a private company.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.440]   And now all of a sudden, oh, we've got other conditions we got to worry about. We got to worry
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.280]   about shareholders. We got to worry about trying to get people to buy stock. And I think that it
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.520]   could be a diversion for them much in the way it was a diversion for Facebook.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:21.040]   Here's a question to brought up to you. So I'm an avid addicted,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.240]   help me please Twitter user, right? And I go through all this stuff. I use a cost. I use Twitter on
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:34.960]   Android. I use tweet deck on my Chromebook. I don't know that I've ever, ever, ever see Twitter ads.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.400]   Do you? Oh, you don't see like promoted tweets or suggested people to follow?
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.840]   But I don't go to that. I look at my list. I look at my, you look at your whole timeline.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.800]   Somewhat, but more I look at the list. I certainly look at my ego feed of what people are saying
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.440]   about me. Yep. Me, me, me.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:13:00.160]   I've actually seen quite a few ads for like the Chromebook. I've seen Google promoted tweets about,
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.520]   you know, when the Chromebook launch or when the next, the next seven launched. But mostly on the
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.960]   web, it's funny because sometimes I'll see tweets that, you know, that say promoted by such and such,
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.240]   but I just kind of scroll by them. They're not that distracting, but I definitely do see them.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   You don't see them at all, Jeff? I don't. And in any case, it's hard to imagine how they're even
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.520]   getting a billion dollars revenue. I mean, ever they are, I believe in that they're getting
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.760]   somewhere near that that obviously this is the right time and the right time for an IPO. That
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.840]   means the business is growing and it's doing well. There's a lot more growth potential.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:37.280]   I just, it's funny. You know, when you saw Google's ad strategy, you really sensed what it was. You
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.960]   saw it all the time. You understood the wisdom of it and the ways it was new and smart. Facebook
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.640]   has struggled a couple of times to figure one out, but you certainly saw visibly what their ad
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:51.440]   strategy was as it went. YouTube, same question. How are they going to put on pre-rolls? How are
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.600]   they going to put ads around it? There was very, very visible Twitter for whatever. And Twitter
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.680]   is just always a mysterious company to me. You know, I think they're always good guys and maybe
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.240]   they purposely make advertising as subtle as they can. Maybe they don't have as much as I think.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.680]   I don't know, but it's just not right in front of me when I use Twitter.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.400]   I see promoted tweets. I don't use Twitter very often, to be honest. I publish everything to
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:20.080]   Twitter, but I don't go there as a source of information very often. I saw promoted tweet
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.960]   by this guy complaining about British Airways recently. Did you guys cover that last week?
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.280]   Oh, yeah, we did. We did cover that. The guy that complained about the way his bag was handled.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.960]   It's interesting. I mean, I've seen a promoted tweet by a friend of mine who was promoting his
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:40.320]   ebook. He'd clearly purchased a way to promote his tweet. I mean, I get emails from Twitter
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:46.080]   saying, "Hey, promote your brand on Twitter. My blog has a Twitter feed." And it's like,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.600]   "You purchased advertising here on Twitter." I mean, it could be that Twitter is trying to be the
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:56.160]   way to advertise for not being companies before individuals. I agree with Jeff. It's not nearly
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.680]   a little word. It's the very clear sort of blue sponsored links in Google search results.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.800]   And it doesn't happen very often. In fact, I'm not signed into Twitter at the moment,
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.360]   and I just did a search for the next seven of the Chromebooks. I recall seeing some of those promoted,
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.840]   and I'm not seeing promoted tweets in those. I have definitely seen Starbucks promoted tweets,
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:21.680]   and I'm not seeing them now. Jeff, you're saying that because their business model is still
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:28.160]   really questionable or at least just not visible, that makes you hesitant about an investment,
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.200]   because their revenue model does the smobius. It's more than I just can't figure it out sometimes.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.240]   I used to joke about it not having a business model. I used to joke Fred Wilson about this,
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.240]   and clearly it does have one now. And it is an advertising. They are figuring out new advertising
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.360]   models. It's more than I'm puzzled that it's either so subtle I don't see it or there's less of
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.880]   it that I don't see it. Neither is necessarily bad at all. Maybe it's good that it's not constantly
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.040]   in my face. Maybe they're making money and I don't even know it, except that I don't think
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.960]   I've discovered any products through Twitter ads. I don't think I've discovered any, you know,
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.120]   anybody's advertised to me successfully through Twitter. So I just find that interesting.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.320]   It's confusing to me too, and I think they're going to really have to make this case, obviously.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.960]   Right. This is going to have to be something that they get much. They've been a little bit
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.640]   private about this in the past, and I think obviously now it's going to have to be a lot
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.920]   more public, especially with investors. But yeah, I mean, maybe you can help them out, Jeff,
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.200]   with the promoted tweets by taking your case against Verizon and purchasing a promoted tweet
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.320]   against Verizon LTE or asking them to support the Nexus 7. I want to get a
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:38.240]   Kickstarter for March on Verizon. There you go. Yeah, if you contribute $10, Jeff will buy a
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:44.160]   promoted tweet to a million people talking about this. Pretty sure Verizon's US headquarters
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.960]   are about three miles from my house, by the way. Oh, get out the eggs. Get out the eggs.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:56.640]   And knock on the guard shack. You need a case of toilet paper. Yeah, virtual toilet paper.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.160]   Well, you were your writer and you raised another point. What's going to happen with this IPO is
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.360]   that there's going to be more probing into Twitter, and there's going to be data that's going to come
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.680]   out the very interesting. One story said that there, and this is a rumor. We don't know if it's true.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.600]   Twitter's internal 2013 growth target was 400 million users and says these sources unnamed,
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.720]   but it's now at 240 million. People are saying, oh, who knows? The other thing I saw yesterday was
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:28.560]   the number of fake counts will be a question mark. And I've long said that when I tweet stuff,
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:36.080]   you think that 122,000 people see every tweet. And of course, the proportion of actually seen
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.680]   tweets, even just seen, is small because so kinds of stuff goes by my feet, I don't see. So,
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.880]   it's kind of counted. Oh, I've got this many followers. I've got this much stuff. It kind of goes back
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:50.560]   to the days of hits on the web. And there's real stats to come out. Now, none of that takes away
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:56.880]   from the power of Twitter, nor that it's still pretty niche as a product. It's changed the world.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:03.200]   It's a big deal. It's on every network TV show. It's all over. It's clearly a success. It's clearly
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.040]   part of the culture. But there's going to be some really interesting studies, I think,
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.680]   being able to come out now about the numbers behind Twitter.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.000]   Yeah, agreed. And in fact, they just made a recent change for verified Twitter users.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.560]   I'm verified. Jeff, I think you're verified as well. So we get to see this. In your mentions tab,
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.720]   and I actually found this, I have mixed feelings about this. In your mentions tab, you can say,
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:33.280]   just show me interactions or replies or mentions that I've gotten from other verified users. So,
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:40.000]   only verified users can filter their mentions by discussions with other verified users, which
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.680]   I really don't like because it feels like you're creating this elite layer of special people
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:55.200]   on Twitter. It's Studio 54. Yes. Very much. There's this very, there's this
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.040]   development rope thing. And the reason why I don't like it is mostly because Twitter has been
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.400]   extremely opaque about why or who gets to be verified, right? For a while there, it was,
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:10.000]   this is for people who have a big enough profile that they have that have to deal with fake accounts
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.960]   being created for them. I've never had a problem with a fake account. I don't know why or how I got
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.240]   verified. There are people who are certainly much more well-known than me and more deserving
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.800]   and have more followers who I know who are not verified. That verification blue checkmark has
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.600]   become some signifier of something or other. I know people who desperately want it, even though
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.320]   it really doesn't give you anything special, but that this changes that, right? So now,
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.880]   I've got access to something that other people don't. And the fact that I'd want to filter my
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   mentions, I mean, the whole point of Twitter is that you can address someone and assume that
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.120]   they're going to see it in their mentions, right? But this idea that you filter just, I mean,
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.360]   of course, people use different clients and not everyone is reading every single thing,
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.880]   but it's this idea that only the people on the list can access me. I don't love that.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.760]   Yeah, I agree with you, Jay.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:04.240]   I don't love that. But I wonder if this turning verified users into this elite club of people
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.360]   who, I don't know, Twitter, the Twitter gods decided to touch with the blue checkmark.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:15.040]   You know, if this is going to be their answer to the question about fake accounts or fake follows.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.600]   Yeah, yes. And I mean, this goes back to their whole celebrity. I mean, Twitter's always
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.560]   catered to celebrity. It's part of the reason why they've been so popular and why hashtags are on TV.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.120]   I mean, celebrities use it and the verified checkmark having started for them, but now is kind of
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:34.560]   filtered down to kind of random, you know, other random people that for whatever reason get it.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:39.840]   So I looked at my verified filtered mentions and there were very few there.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:45.920]   I mean, I'm friends a lot of verified people, but I'd much rather look at my regular connect mentions.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   Is there anything else on Twitter here? No, back to Eve Williams for a minute. Just to mention
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:59.920]   him before and changing the world is that Eve is not a secretive guy, but he's a quiet guy.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:03.520]   Ironic considering what he's done in life is to create all these ways that people can
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:09.120]   can scream to the world. But he did talk in a fascinating interview, I thought, about his plans
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:16.240]   for medium and the future of medium. And his big notion was that we are too addicted to news
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.720]   and we need to be more addicted to ideas and that that's what he thinks medium does.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.320]   Whether it succeeds or not, you know, we'll have to see over time, but it's an interesting and
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:30.480]   I'm not sure I fully understand how the various elements of medium act up to that or add up to that.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.760]   I'd love to hear his rationale about that, but I think it's an important idea that we get so
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.640]   tied up and it's funny. Twitter caused a lot of this. Twitter clearly made it worse where we're
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.360]   constantly, you know, what's new, what's new, what's new, what's latest, what's latest. It can be all
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.320]   the latest and it doesn't really inform us. It doesn't really get us anywhere. And instead,
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.920]   we'd be better off if we spend a little time with an idea and scratched our heads about that,
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.360]   then that's what he's trying to do with medium. So maybe he's trying to make up for Twitter in a way,
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:04.400]   but it's an interesting view. Yeah, it's interesting. Medium is really this sort of, it's the opposite
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.200]   of Twitter and then it's long form writing. You know, it's more fully baked ideas. Maybe this is
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.760]   this is Ev's way, you know, it's kind of really the opposite of Twitter. I think that medium is
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.680]   very much a product in progress. I think that there's a lot of iterating going on there.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.160]   Um, I think that we were involved in a Twitter conversation that Ev kind of responded to and
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:27.120]   we were talking about, um, yeah, there have been a few essays published on medium, which has
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.760]   turned out to be kind of, kind of Silicon Valley focused a lot. You write for medium,
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.480]   but you know, there's some people who get paid the right of medium, some people don't, there's
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.040]   some, some editors of collections who get paid and some people who don't. And yeah, that one guy
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.680]   who was a total tool who wrote this essay that was just sort of, I don't know, it was sort of
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.880]   sort of sexist and just kind of dumb. And there was this kind of firestorm about it.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:52.800]   There's this weird sort of like Silicon Valley bro thing going on on medium. And then, and, and
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.880]   we were, it was me and Anil, we were saying to Ed, like, why don't you disclose, why does a
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.520]   medium disclose who gets paid and who doesn't? And he said, well, why is that, you know, why is that
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.360]   important? And it's like, well, medium is this weird thing where it's like, it's not clear that
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.720]   it's user generated content. It seems like there's an overarching editorial voice, um, in that there
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.600]   are collections, but you know, it would be useful to know, you know, who's speaking and he's, you know,
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.760]   I don't like it. I think you made the point, Jeff, that it's surprising, right? That people are
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.520]   surprised. They don't, they don't really know what to expect. And I think he said, well, I'd like
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.240]   to surprise people. Yeah, he's always, that was exactly what I wish I loved that. What's fascinating
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.480]   about medium to me, and this is, this is really wall-cushion, the media world, but, but it's the
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.760]   first attempt I've really seen to, to, to, I've always said, I say that my students, you're either
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.160]   B2B or B2C. You're either a platform or you're a product. And if you're a platform, you
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.920]   enable products. If you're a product, you use platforms. And medium is trying to be both.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:51.440]   Medium is trying to be a platform where lots of people can come in and can use it in various
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.880]   ways. And Ev is quick to say there's crap on medium, just like there's crap on Twitter and
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.560]   there's crap on TV. I'm not cleaning up all the crap, but I'm trying to encourage good stuff there.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:05.280]   And so, though she's trying to create a brand around, I guess, ideas. And so at the same time,
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.640]   he's a product. But he's a product he doesn't fully control. He encourages in some way. And
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:15.440]   that's, that's, I think that part of the, you know, if you're looking for that Ev, little,
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.360]   little light bulb in there and trying to see where the inside is, that may not be it. But I'm,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.720]   I'm starting to think that maybe that's it, that he's trying to, trying to bridge that gap
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:28.000]   between platform and product. What do you think? Yeah, I mean, that's interesting. It's a tough,
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.040]   it's a tough line at toe. You know, part of me is like, well, be one, you know, be one of the
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.000]   other because those are the two models that we've had. But I'm also a big believer, particularly
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.120]   around community management, that anyone can contribute. But you have, you have leaders,
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:48.320]   or you see the community with, with good actors, right, to, to set the tone and to set an example,
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.560]   right? So if, if medium is paying certain writers or, or is commissioning certain writers or is
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.560]   asking certain writers like you, Jeff, to contribute, and they're creating a platform,
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.680]   which is clearly, it's beautiful and it's easy to use. And it's really, it is kind of a, I mean,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.280]   even though you can write for it for free, I mean, it's a nice sort of, you know,
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.680]   byline to have their kind of, they're setting, they're setting a tone of like, this is the kind
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.000]   of content that we want. This is the kind of thing that we're looking for. And even just the whole
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   look and feel. It's very clean. The topography is beautiful and, and layout. So yeah, I mean,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.680]   that's, it's interesting. I like that, I like that, I like that setting that tone, you know,
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:29.200]   setting example and seeing what happens. And trying to build something there.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.040]   Hagrid Aaron says in the chat room that perhaps Reddit is trying to do something similar. I think
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:39.760]   it's a good point. Oh, how so? Well, because it wants to be a platform and some Reddit people can
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.080]   use it however they want, including some pretty yucky, awful ways. But yet it also has a brand
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:51.680]   and Reddit stands for some things. And it's caused them problems. It's caused them some grief
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.600]   because of people putting up scuzzy pictures of young girls and that kind of stuff on Reddit.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.960]   Right. How can you allow this if you have a brand what's there? Well, no, we're a platform. Well,
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.600]   are your breath been or a kennymet, dammit? Yeah, no, it's true. And the whole creep shots thing
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.880]   happened. I think that it was, it was really difficult for people to understand, you know,
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.640]   why wasn't Reddit moderating this? Oh, well, Reddit just like kind of like the internet and
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.800]   anybody could do anything on it. Well, but not really right. Because it's all Reddit. And you
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.560]   know, they do moderate something. They do take down spam, you know, that there's, there was
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.400]   uncertainty around it. And I got to tell you, I really, after that whole creep shots thing in
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:28.400]   particular, I was like, they gave this guy a trophy for what he was doing in this community. Like,
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.520]   this is not, this is not activity that we should encourage and enable, you know,
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.280]   thought please and censorship and blah, blah, blah. But that was definitely the problem there.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.760]   You know, what is, what is Reddit? Is it a platform or is it a product? And it kind of is both. And I
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.840]   think mediums kind of facing the same thing with this guy that wrote this, you know, annoying essay
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:51.120]   that was just kind of crap. So it's, that's a tough, tough line to tell. But I like that, I like
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:55.840]   that, especially like that, is, is playing around with it. Because I, I agree, I think he's, he's kind
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:59.680]   of one of the good guys. He's done. He's had two, two big hips. I think, I think that he really
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.440]   believes I think that he really cares about the web. And so I'm actually not annoyed that he's
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.680]   going to be a billionaire. I'm not at all. I'm, I'm delighted. I'm not saying, if you're watching,
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.160]   which I don't think you are, but if you were, I'm not saying that just to suck up. You know,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:17.040]   you deserve it. I saw you when you were starving. I saw you when you cared about your company.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.840]   You've, you've done great things for the world. So, and I, and I also think that he'll spend it well.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.320]   That's the other thing. There was somebody said, I think it was a guardian coming to his free
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.640]   pieces. The, the Forbes richest person list came out, I think, and somebody said, oh, it's just a,
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.560]   nothing but a list of greed and exploitation, which may well be the case. But, but it was
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:39.520]   interesting to look at that, that way, who on that list is there because A, they did something
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.200]   that improved the world and B, that they'll use that wealth to in turn improve the world,
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.480]   versus people who do just exploit us like, oh, I don't know, Verizon.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:28:00.160]   Different topic. Box, I have not dug into box yet. Box is a new competitor to Google Docs.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.080]   Have you got, and also Microsoft, have you guys played with it all yet? Do you have any idea what
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.560]   it is yet? I haven't. This is different than box.net. Right. Or is it box.net?
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.760]   I thought it was the same as box.net, but maybe it's not. It's box.net.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.920]   Oh, it is. It is box.com. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So it's okay. So my,
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.720]   I thought this was sort of like Dropbox.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.880]   But it also evidently has content creation tools and more added. So there's an interesting,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.240]   you know, fight going on there. The, the, you know, I'm now, I'm, because I live
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:41.360]   love you to Google and because I'm on Chrome, I now live in Google Docs. I'm not really using
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.560]   Dropbox as much as I used to because I have that. But I love to Dropbox
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:52.160]   because it changed my mind about the cloud. So I don't, you know, there must be more
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.920]   opportunities in the cloud and better cloud services and more specific cloud services.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:01.120]   You know, that's the other thing about, about once again about medium medium, you know,
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.920]   just on the blogging tool, but it adds value. There's another one called you mentioned
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.640]   last week. I think Gino draft in draft. Yeah. Drafting in dot com draft. Yeah, which is
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.600]   what they were delighted. They came on Twitter and were delighted that you had
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.440]   plugged them by the way. So yeah, yeah, giving his positive feedback loop works.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:25.040]   Trying to add better elegance to the tools that exist, kind of moving past the Microsoft
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.840]   agent, you know, Microsoft and Google and that says, aren't that different? Google's simpler,
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:33.120]   but Google's pretty ugly. Microsoft has always been ugly and adding elegance into creation
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.760]   tools would be a nice thing. Yeah, well, they must there must be a business case behind this.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:43.840]   Right. Otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. I know that I can testify as someone who just joined
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.880]   a new company and is stuck in a Microsoft world. Like, I'm sure there's ways to do this. I apologize
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:53.200]   to those. I'm not a SharePoint person, but I can't stand SharePoint after using Google Docs because
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:56.720]   I want to be in a document with like we're doing right now in the show notes, right?
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:03.200]   Editing things together at the same time. And, you know, maybe, maybe my company's just not up to the
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.840]   latest addition of SharePoint or whatever they're supposed to be using, but it's very frustrating
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.680]   to have someone. Oh, someone else has this document out and it's locked for editing and you can't
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.360]   update it. And I'm pulling my hair out going, why can't we use Google Docs around here?
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.240]   So I think there is a lot of space. I think you hit on it, Jeff, when you said that there's a
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.720]   lot of space for innovation here in the cloud, the cloud document space. Obviously, Microsoft has
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:31.360]   gone there with a 365 platform, Office 365, Google's been there for a while. And I think that, you know,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:36.000]   it's one of those areas where it's ripe for innovation. And this is an example of companies
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.160]   trying to jump on the bandwagon and make something work. So, let's look at the list and see what
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:46.880]   else we want to throw in here. So Hugo Barra talked about his life. And one of the things that I
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.720]   found most fascinating about the story is that he pronounced the company. He said, it's like,
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.640]   show me, but it's shower me. Shower me, shower me. There was an R sound in there.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:03.600]   Did you guys talk about that last night on Android, Gina? We did. We did. So Hugo Barra,
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:11.040]   former VP at Android, Google now, and Chinese handset manufacturer Xiaomi, shower me.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:19.440]   Yeah, very ambitious plans. He wants to, he wants Xiaomi to be as big a company as Apple and Google
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.520]   in the next 10 or 20 years. He says, if I do my job right, it'll be talking about Xiaomi in the
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:30.240]   same way. And this is pretty interesting, especially because I think Xiaomi has its own kind of Android
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:37.440]   build going on with me UI, which is a new UI on top of Android. So it's like, it's almost as if Barra
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:42.000]   is building on top of Android, but also sort of competing with Google on it at the same time.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.400]   And I don't know if they're going to focus their growth on emerging markets or if they're going
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.600]   to be a challenge of international, right? Not China, but international.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.160]   Right. Right. So he is, I believe he is going to live in Asia and I think that he's going to focus on
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:04.560]   emerging markets. So this is going to be interesting to see what he brings, what he brings to the table.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:10.160]   I went to this company and we'll compete with Google, actually.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.000]   Well, exactly. I went to Amazon too, and I looked, you know, you can buy the phones now.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.960]   There are Amazon, they're Android 4.1, most of them. Quite a price range from very inexpensive to,
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:25.520]   I think about 400 bucks. I'm sure that Verizon will take none of them.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:36.720]   But interesting to see what could happen there. And also Hugo says I didn't leave because of the whole
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.720]   personal issue and all that that he's been talking about for quite some time.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.400]   I think he actually addressed that. He addressed it. Yes, he did. He did. Which, you know, fine.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:51.600]   And I think that, you know, I read between the lines and I think that the
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.960]   Ruben Levy and Sundar coming in, I think it was just kind of the time. He accomplished a great deal
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:02.000]   and he saw a new opportunity and, you know, he wasn't going to be Sundar in the short term
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.960]   at least. And so he went off to do something else. He has a lot of respect. People really like Hugo.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.080]   He's done a lot of good work. So I'm rooting for him to surprise us and do some amazing things there.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:18.320]   It isn't shower me. It's show me. Just show me. There's no Yara in there.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.720]   Oh, it's show. Why is he so it's the shower without the Yara? Yeah, exactly. Yes.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.280]   Thank you, Jim. Yeah, X, X, A, I, O, in opinion is show.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:32.640]   Show me. Okay, you were on the whole time, Gina. Okay. So I think it's interesting that he addressed
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.600]   this controversy. I don't want to go into it. I don't want to be rude.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:40.640]   I don't want to go to it. But I'm sure that when you're at a point where it's like,
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.720]   okay, I'm ready for a change. And then something like that happens as well.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.120]   It's kind of like icing on the cake. It's like, okay, this is done. I'm very happy
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.280]   making this change in my life right now, right? So, yeah, I mean, of course, this is a Chinese
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.400]   company concerned, you know, the first, the first, the lead of the article is him explaining how to
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:06.400]   pronounce the name, speaking of names. Anyway, but we have a
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.600]   time. Shouldn't I seem strange to us? No, that's true. Good point.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.880]   You know, but I think an X might be a little more
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.360]   frightful, too many vowels and an X, you know, could add up too much for us. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.120]   It's it's the show me phone.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:28.560]   Anything else to run down before we get to our our stuff and money?
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:36.160]   All right. Well, I just got word from Chad that Leo is crawling off a gondola right now.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.720]   He's he's gone through a lot of wine. He's got a pizza in his hand. He's got a funny shirt on,
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:46.400]   and he's going to lead us into a message from our sponsors. I Jeff, yes, I'm back.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.840]   No, I'm not really. I recorded this before I left. But I first of all want to thank you for
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.920]   doing the show for me. I really appreciate it. And they asked me to mention legal zoom since
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:59.360]   I have used it. In fact, I used legal zoom to set up twit way back when that's how we got our LLC.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:03.040]   You know, it's interesting. I didn't need a lawyer. I just needed legal zoom.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:08.400]   Didn't cost me much 99 bucks plus filing fees. And we're still today. We're still using I have
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:13.760]   a lawyer now a lot of them and a lot of money out of the door. We're still using that LLC that
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.480]   legal zoom set up way back in 2005. You know, I'm not I'm not alone over the last 12 years.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.000]   A million business owners have trusted legal zoom to help start their business, whether it's a
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:30.320]   LLC, a chapter, S or C incorporation. If it's a trademark, a patent, they do it all DBAs.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:36.880]   You can even form a nonprofit starting in 99 bucks at legal zoom.com. You don't need a lawyer
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.440]   for this stuff. They're not a law firm. Although they have this new legal plan, I really like this
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:46.080]   where they'll hook you up with the lawyer at a pre negotiated, very affordable flat rate.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:50.640]   I love that. You can check out the lawyers in your state, read the reviews, the profiles,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.200]   on that review, though. So you know exactly what customers are saying about those lawyers.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.760]   You get the right lawyer for you. You know, everything from he was no nonsense. He got
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:03.280]   right to the point to he took the time to explain. You know, what do you need? He took the time to
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:09.680]   explain it. I love legal zoom.com. And I think you will too save time and money. And don't forget,
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:15.040]   make a will. If you haven't done that yet, make a trust, a durable power of attorney health care,
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.160]   all of that legal zoom.com. All I ask if you use legal zoom and I think you'll want to
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.800]   use the offer code TWIG in the checkout box to get 10 bucks off and let them know you heard
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:32.640]   it about it on twig. Legal zoom.com. Please use twig as the offer code. Thanks back to you, Jeff.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   So I love that in the pre recorded commercial, Leo is wearing his little Moto X magnet thing
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:44.000]   on a shirt. I'm betting that's lost by now somewhere in a Venetian canal.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:52.240]   It is. That's why we love him that Leo. That is. All right. So let's get to our end to our
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.880]   things. Aaron, you want to lead off this time with with your thing, your thing? Yeah, sure. I
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.840]   can absolutely. So I think you guys have talked about this a little bit before, but I wanted to
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.680]   give everyone kind of a preview of Google device manager. So if you haven't seen this or you haven't
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:14.560]   used it before, or I started as Android device manager. This is something that can help you track
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:20.160]   your phone or phones. In my case, I have a bunch of my phones for my family all registered under
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:24.880]   my name. And so I can actually track like if I want to know, hey, my son said he was going over
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:31.040]   somebody else's house. Is he really there? I don't do that. But I could do that if I wanted to
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.280]   with Android device manager. And so I thought I'd do a little demo of this in case you haven't
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:42.320]   seen it or in case you don't know what this is. So if you look at my if you take my screen here,
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:47.120]   you can see, whoops, where am I? Here we go. So the way that you get to this, there's a couple
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:53.040]   things you need to do to make this work. Number one, you go to google.com/androids/devicemanager.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:58.240]   And then on your device, you need to actually approve this in your in your device settings.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.480]   So if you go into your security screen, let me back up so you can see here's your settings,
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:08.560]   your typical Android settings. And if you go into security, and then down below, there'll be a
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:14.240]   section for device administrators. And you'll see Android device manager is listed there.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.800]   And so you just click on the button to enable that. And you'll see what it gives you. Now,
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.120]   this is something that this is something new that you may or may not be able to read my screen there.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.040]   But something new is change the screen unlock password. This just came out
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:34.000]   recently. In fact, Gina pointed this out today that you can actually now Google is making it
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.880]   possible for you to change the screen screen unlock password remotely. And if you're unless
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.400]   your device is powered off, as long as it's on somewhere, you can turn it on remotely. And if it's
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:51.520]   not powered on, you can go into the web browser and actually don't have this. Let me see if I can do
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:57.280]   this on the fly. How's that? Can you get that, Chad?
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.200]   >> Yeah. >> Whoop. Is there a better way to -- I don't know if you can see that. Can you see that?
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.360]   >> Yeah. >> So I see it. So this is the UI on the website. You just go to, like I said,
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:16.000]   the URL is Google.com/angylize/devicemanager. It'll pull up a list of all of your phones that
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.680]   are registered to your account. And you can actually go in, you can ring the phone, you can
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.480]   erase the phone remotely. And so in the case that your device is powered off, if you hit erase,
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:28.400]   as soon as the device powers back up and connects to the network, it'll actually go ahead and erase
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.160]   the device, which is pretty awesome. And if you hit ring, in fact, I'll do this with my phone now,
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:39.440]   since this is my S4, you can see on my screen the map, you can see that I'm actually at the
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.400]   brick house. So, you know, there's no trickery going on here. I'm actually here. I can hit ring,
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:50.400]   and it'll say, "Do you want to ring your device?" Yes, I do. And it should -- come on, there we go.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:54.080]   It should go out, and it says, "Device was wrong." And there goes my phone.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.960]   With a really irritating ringtone, I might add. It really loud, irritating ringtone. It is.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.640]   And so you have to hit the power button in order to turn that off. But that's really helpful,
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:10.400]   because I don't know about you guys, but for example, like my wife is always losing her phone
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.440]   all the time, and then she goes back to whatever she was, and she's like, "I don't know what I
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.520]   do with it. It was here when I left. It's around here somewhere." And so I can actually go in and
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:23.360]   remotely ring her phone, and she can go over and find it. It's stuck in the couch cushions or
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.160]   something like that. So it's a really, really cool feature. And I used to use Prey. I don't
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.440]   know if you guys know about Prey. It's an application that does similar things to this, and I'm thinking
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:39.600]   about getting rid of Prey, because this is so fully functioned and works so well. I don't think I
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.240]   need Prey anymore. I think this will work just fine. So have you guys played with Device Manager at all?
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.160]   No, I just pulled that. Yeah, I enabled this kind of right away. As soon as I heard that it was available,
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.960]   I feel like this is one of those things. I mean, it shouldn't be on by default, because of course,
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.920]   you're giving Google the ability to erase your device and tracking your device and all that.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.720]   I mean, Google already knows rear devices anyway. But this is really, really useful,
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.040]   because if your phone gets stolen, or like you said, if you just misplaced it, or somewhere in
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.480]   the house, you can't find it. That happens to me all the time, especially now that I got a baby
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.760]   and all her stuff. It's just so convenient. And it just gives me peace of mind. Like, oh, if I
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.080]   did drop the phone or leave the phone, or if I think the phone's been stolen, I don't have to start
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.160]   to think, oh, I wish I should have, I don't have to rush to a computer and change my Google password.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:31.680]   I can just say, just wipe it or won't wipe it. It's a good feeling.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.800]   Absolutely.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.960]   Hina.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.720]   My tip this week is a little Android tip that we talked about last night on all about Android,
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:47.200]   but I have that so useful. I had to bring it up again. In Google Maps on Android, there's a quicker way
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.920]   to get to navigation for driving navigation, which is usually what I use it for the most.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:57.120]   So in Google Maps on Android, if you search for a location, so I've gotten into Google Maps and
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.000]   I've searched for for Twit up in Petaluma, then you'll see that you'll see the name of the place,
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.680]   the bottom of the screen, and there's a route button. So normally we'd have to do is you tap the route
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:10.960]   button and then it would give you this other screen. My location best buy, you choose cycling,
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:17.120]   bus, walking, car, and then you can just long press, long press on the route button,
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:22.960]   and it will drop you directly into navigation, which by the way, it would take me eight hours
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:28.800]   and 44 minutes to drive up to Petaluma right now. But just just just quick tip, long press on the
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:33.520]   route button and you'll go straight into navigation and you can skip a step, which is especially handy
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.120]   when you're in the car or you're, of course, you shouldn't be doing this while you're driving,
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.200]   but if you're parked in your car and you're ready to go and you just want to get direct
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:45.360]   to direction. So long press on that route button when you're in Google Maps and you'll go directly
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:50.480]   into navigation. One of the things I love about Android is when I was in a dress in my calendar
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.840]   or an email or something and I click on it, I then get the choice of whether to go into maps or
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.920]   ways or something else. And each time it's a little bit different. Last Sunday, I was trying to find
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:05.920]   some place obscure in New Jersey and I thought Google Maps had the better route. So I used that,
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.200]   but then then turns out they didn't know about a dead end and ways did. And ways got me around.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.360]   I mean, they were to go back and forth between the two. I'm such a fan of ways and soon that I
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:20.320]   don't know if the two will merge, but it's great. All right, I have a very quick number, which is
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.320]   GigaOM reports from a conference going on right now in the UK and somewhere in Europe, I don't
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:32.240]   know where Felix Baumgartner's jump causing my, you know, if I don't like bridges, you can imagine
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.360]   how much I love that jump, watching that, but I did because you could not watch it. Well, it turns
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.600]   out that it consumed a quarter of the world's bandwidth. Wow. With people watching that off
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.480]   YouTube, that's just mind blowing. Hey, that's how many people came to one thing and B the Google
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.680]   could handle it, that it could handle a quarter of the world's bandwidth in one way or another. I
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:02.880]   just find that amazing. That's crazy. That is crazy. I had no idea. Yeah, amazing.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.120]   So I think we have come to the end of our week. We miss we miss Leo. We miss Lisa. We hope they're
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.680]   having a wonderful, wonderful time in Italy. They're probably just finishing a lovely pizza right
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:21.840]   now and a nice red wine, I hope for them. And so that's it. So Aaron Nukem, thank you very much.
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:26.640]   As Jane has said at the top, it was so great to have not only a human being, but this human being,
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:33.360]   you human being. It's just great. Anything you want to plug from your life? Yeah. So definitely,
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.840]   people should follow me on Google+. If you haven't heard that already, add me to your circles on
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.360]   Google+. That's where I actually have conversations with people post some rather humorous things,
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.720]   or at least I think they're funny. So if you share my sense of humor, you'll laugh hysterically.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.600]   And talk about Google and Android and open source and all that kind of stuff,
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.640]   which goes along with a lot of the shows. I'm also on Twitter and Facebook, by the way, so
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.520]   everything gets reposted there. So you can follow me there if you want to. And then I'm also involved
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:07.680]   in Floss Weekly. I did Floss Weekly this morning talking about OpenWRT, which is open source firmware
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:11.920]   for a lot of routers and other embedded devices that you can use instead of the manufacturer's
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:17.440]   firmware. Very cool stuff. And occasionally on all about Android with Gina and Jason and Ron,
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.880]   so I want to mention them too. Also, as long as you gave me the opportunity to plug, I would say,
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.920]   if you're going to be in San Francisco for Oracle Open World next week, huge show, 45,000
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.040]   people are there. If you're going to be there and you want to meet me, come down to the NetApp booth
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:39.360]   in Moscone South. I'll be there. I'll be wearing a NFL referee uniform. So you'll have to ask me
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.120]   about that when you get there while I'm wearing that. But I should be easy to pick out of the crowd.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:47.120]   Just come to the NetApp booth in Moscone South, introduce yourself, say, "Hey, I'm a fan. I like
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.640]   you know, watching what you do on the Twit Network or otherwise." And I'd love to meet people and
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.640]   say hi and shake hands and stuff like that. So definitely come look me up next week at Oracle
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:05.920]   Open World. Yay, Gina. All right. So there's only one thing worth plugging this week. One thing we
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:14.160]   must plug this week. Happy birthday, Etta. Oh, thank you. I will pass on all of Twig Watchers
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.320]   birthday wishes. Yeah, I can't believe it's been a year. It's crazy. I was when I was thinking about
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:23.280]   this, I was going to have us all start singing. But then I realized we'd probably get pulled from
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.520]   YouTube if we did because it's the right thing to do. So I think you could hum it.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:34.640]   I'm very excited to give her a hand, her a cake and see what she does with it.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.680]   That's the best. That's the best for one year old. They're like,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:45.040]   first, my kids were tentative at first. And then they're like, oh, I can do this. No one's
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:50.560]   going to stop me. Yeah. I'm a little worried about what she's going to do when she puts the
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.880]   icing in her mouth because I think that it'll be the sweetest, richest, sugrest thing that she's
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:00.800]   eaten in her entire life. So he might be complete in utter sugar shock. I get the perfect. So we'll
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:05.520]   see. I'll get a good, a good mom award for that one. But thank you, John.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.080]   Who freak out with it. What is all this happening here? It's not my normal life. What are you
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:15.440]   being in the birdie thing in front of me? What are you doing? So yeah. Oh, yeah. I know you'll have
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:21.200]   a little better than I did. So happy birthday, Edda. Happy, happy birthday by connection moms.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.560]   And that's it. That's as I used to say on Twitter. That's a wrap. Thank you very much. Thank you
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.320]   for being here. I know it's not the same without Leo, but I'm glad you're here. Glad you're watching
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:35.520]   this. You can watch us online anytime. You can come on live and see the fun beforehand.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.200]   Leo would tell you right now what time it's on UTC. But I haven't the faintest idea with it.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:44.480]   It is. I can't deal with West Coast versus East Coast. So all I'll say is goodbye. That's it for
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.040]   Twigmas.
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:54.880]   [Music]
