[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   Good to see you Jeff also joining me here on the set and
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.120]   Pruitt
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.840]   Solo twitch yes fellow twitch. Yeah, how does that happen? I you know?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.320]   It just one day you wake up and you realize you just flew on the trip you drove your family across the country
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.640]   2017 miles that's that's amazing
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.360]   917 miles and that took you to an e-spectacular tourist
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.480]   Tacky tourist things all the way none none. The only thing I really did was the Grand Canyon. That was the only thing
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.040]   Okay, that's a big one, but the other might you mentioned in my palms sweat because if you're not fear that you're looking over the edge
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.660]   It was great. I did it was just beautiful now first time
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.160]   When you were at the Grand Canyon, did you do they have rules against drones?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.720]   Sending drones out and getting footage allegedly to have rules, okay?
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.440]   No, but I didn't I didn't fly to drone this time. Okay, I did take the dogs and let the dogs run around and they enjoyed
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.920]   Oh, so you let the dogs out. I did okay
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.000]   I've been wondering to let the dogs out of it now. I know I did
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.680]   And it's great to have you here both sitting on set and working at Twitter and sitting behind me
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.580]   Right over my shoulder. That's right. So everything that I enter on my computer in our office
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.600]   I am you have yeah, you have the ability to say that out loud dinner
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   Now I know
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.440]   It's great to have you on today. Thank you and yeah, so
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.720]   I mean, I was gonna say right up front yesterday was this thing you may have heard of it
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.800]   It was an apple announcement and I feel like as every year it happens apple announced apple
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.120]   Sucked like a vacuum the news out of the world
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.640]   Power for some reason how does a company have that much power?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.480]   You know, I don't know but they did it, but we do have some news that we can talk about
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.880]   We'll probably get a little bit later get into things that might touch a little bit on what Apple talked about
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.880]   But we should probably start with
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.960]   This whole antitrust thing because there's a bunch of threads happening right now as I was looking at the rundown
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.120]   There's all these different pieces moving
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.800]   The Justice Department of course is already probing Google and you can add to that an antitrust
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.720]   investigation that was just announced 50 states and territories
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.560]   Announce this investigation on Monday. They say Google dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.320]   That's according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. They're focusing on the online
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:30.040]   Advertising aspects to start. They also have complaints on search result rankings protecting personal information a whole smorgasbord of everything that we
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.280]   You know read about in the news lately as far as what Google's doing badly
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   They say Google poses an
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.680]   Allegedly very very good. That's important. Google poses a quote existential threat to our virtual marketplace
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:53.640]   Now what's interesting here? Yes, is that every state is included and except Alabama and
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.560]   California
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.640]   But it's at 50 states 50 states and territories they had to throw in two territories to make up for the states, right?
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   Yes, so exactly
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.560]   Which I mean in and of itself though, that's a whole lot of involvement from all directions
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.840]   But you know obviously Alabama California out on that
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.400]   They don't want a piece piece of the flesh they get piece of the pie piece of the Android pie
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:27.000]   What do you think Jeff? I mean this is just a yet another pile on happening right now. Well, I'm of two minds
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.120]   Yeah, so Facebook is also under this kind of of a ledge scrutiny. There's another story there about about Amazon
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.800]   We have the far right going after the tech platforms because they think they're being not nice to them
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.720]   We have the left going after them because they're big capitalistic companies
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.200]   We have a general wise media
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.720]   Techlash going on with
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.480]   Newspaper and magazine publishers suddenly becoming lobbyists, which makes me very uncomfortable as a journalist
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.160]   Trying to get protectionist legislation and regulation going on. So that's the atmosphere at which the time this happens
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.400]   I'll come back to that in a second, but
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.560]   Having said all that and I'm I always get worried about
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.360]   Regulators going after the internet and our freedoms there
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.160]   I have long said and long said on this show that the one area where Google is
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.760]   vulnerable is in advertising they do control tremendous
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.160]   part of the advertising market they
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.960]   Have a kingmakers role there. They bought double click years ago and were perfectly allowed to do so
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.680]   though some said at the time it shouldn't have happened and so
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:43.080]   Yeah, there is some weakness when it comes to advertising and the question is what evidence is there of Google using his power in Europe?
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.600]   They went after Google and they're still going after Google for its placement of shopping ads
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.080]   That's ridiculous because shopping means hardly nothing in this you know, they're way off the mark as far as I'm concerned
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.640]   But but an investigation of advertising. We'll see what it yields
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.920]   So that's that's part one
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.880]   Part two is another piece in here that says
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   From Yahoo finance. We need more monopolies like Google, right?
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.280]   Mmm
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.160]   And I really liked this piece by by Rick Newman a senior columnist at Yahoo finance
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   Who just talked about how
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.720]   Yes, they're going after him. Yes, Elizabeth Warren was to break up all the all the big tech companies
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.120]   Yes, Trump has attacked them
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.520]   But he says if Google is an abusive monopoly then we need more abusive monopolies
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.800]   Consumers clearly love being ripped off by Google ranking it constantly consistently near the top among consumer brands
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.320]   Consumers don't seem to have a problem with Google's business model, but regulators sure do
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.640]   Yeah, and and goes on then a little later after the story continues button and says that you know
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   If you're gonna go after
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:00.400]   Companies, maybe you should go after Equifax which just today told everybody who thought they were gonna get a hundred twenty five bucks from them for their for their
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.640]   illegal horrible acts no no no no we're gonna make you walk through glass and
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.000]   steamy love it to get that money I walked
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.160]   I
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.040]   Clicked through there are many many many things that they made you made you clip click through to to to get the money
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.120]   I don't expect that I will get any of the money no, but you did wait to $125 worth of your labor
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.960]   What is it worth? Well the way you're paid there no probably up to a little more
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.280]   Right so so why are you evil companies like that and Wells Fargo?
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:39.080]   And companies that really do abuse their employees like in this column dollar tree and dollar general and flower foods and extended say and so on
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   so forth and and
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.280]   You know, they're almost treating the companies as if they're tobacco companies
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.000]   But show me the harm and that's that's my final point here is that is that I am among consumers
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.800]   I see no harm. I see nothing but benefit from these companies and especially Google
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.400]   We can argue about Facebook. We can argue about what you think about Facebook
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:09.440]   But Google straight out is a service company provides tremendous services for free without harm to consumers
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.200]   benefiting consumers what's really going on is all the old institutions of society economic and government are threatened by the internet and
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.920]   Now they're fighting back against them and now I fear what's gonna happen to our freedoms and their spiel
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:31.400]   Do you think is more of an ignorance about the internet or threat because every time we saw something in the court system would have you?
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.600]   Those leaders at like they knew nothing about the internet at all
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.320]   It's an important point and I think you're right. That's kind of the beginning point
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   But I think basically that ignorance
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.060]   leads them to get used as
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.240]   Tools of those who want to fight down the net and its freedoms that includes
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.400]   Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say my colleagues in the newspaper business and magazine business. It includes politicians
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.720]   Fear that movements can now rise up against them and they can and and and campaigns can rise up against them
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   It includes
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.140]   But but here's one thing I don't hear the advertisers
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.320]   Complaining I can be wrong. Maybe I'm listening to the right places
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.200]   But I don't hear them screaming bloody murderer about being abused by Google
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.400]   And that's really if they're going after an anti-trust and advertising that should be the victim
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   Consumers are not the victim
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.120]   advertisers
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.440]   All at all aren't the victim there and they're in open marketplaces with with open bidding
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:42.800]   And they're getting a hell of a lot better deal than ever did media who's complaining our media because media were too damn stupid
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.340]   So in the one sense you're right aunt. It's the politicians were stupid
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:53.540]   But then that stupidity gets exploited by my stupid colleagues and media who didn't know how to
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.040]   Create a new business and a new reality and are now are resorting to this
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.840]   Yeah, I think
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.400]   Reading through that that Yahoo the finance to Yahoo piece
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:12.320]   I realized that is the conundrum that I have found myself in when I kind of go back and forth as far as how I feel
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.880]   About all this stuff and and I feel very hypocritical at times because on one hand like of course
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.600]   I don't want a company to abuse this power and a competitive behavior is you know
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.440]   I would I would not say well
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.800]   That's a very good thing to be any competitive like I want things to be fair
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.040]   And so I would push for that at the same time and and so when I look at Google
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.760]   You know, it's very easy for me to see why someone might get that feeling
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.760]   Lacking any solid evidence like there's a lot of feeling going on right now when it comes to technology
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:46.800]   And I just feel like they're bad. I just feel like they're doing bad things and so therefore we need to crack down it on the other side of it
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.400]   I am a very loyal Google user
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.600]   Yeah, and I enjoy all of these services and obviously I enjoy it enough to stick with Google
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.360]   Otherwise, I would have left
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.680]   Left Google for something else and so it isn't it hasn't hit that tipping point to where I'm like well
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.240]   It's serious enough where I've seen the evidence that I need in order to pull that
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.320]   I believe it or not people or some people are happy with Facebook
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:16.640]   There are yeah with the with the results that they get for a lot of advertising on their own Facebook with their business and things like that
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.480]   Or yeah, you know, there are some people that are happy with it regardless of some of the
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:28.360]   Interesting practices that they may have in place. I think you know, I think all these big companies all of them have interesting practices
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.200]   Facebook for and that's where I begin to also feel more hypocritical, right?
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.720]   Like I did step away from Facebook
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.760]   I don't have a Facebook account anymore for whatever reason in the in the field of Facebook
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.200]   That was motivating enough for me to step away and and close my account
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.480]   But if I really compare what these services are doing, there's there's a lot of overlap
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.200]   All right a lot of similarity why why would I as a user give Google a pass and not Facebook?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.220]   It's kind of hard to put my finger on it. You can gem. Yeah, what why why yeah?
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.400]   I was gonna try to do the logic. I'd buy my lost my logic there
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.000]   But yeah, what's what's so awful Facebook's rep got awful in
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.320]   Media and they screwed something up royally
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   But I've also saw a piece recently that said that the whole Cambridge Analytica affair was way overblown
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.600]   There was no real harm there Cambridge Analytica was a bunch of flin flammen who weren't really doing anything
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.000]   And the there was an abuse of Facebook's rules and that's gotten blown out to the point that Facebook is now considered evil
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.920]   What would have full disclosure? I raised money for my school from Facebook
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.400]   I'm independent of Facebook received don't put money personally from any of the platforms and the disclosure. Yeah
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.840]   Anytime algorithms are involved it's you might as well just assume
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:55.320]   That you're a number and don't really count and and there's gonna be some shady stuff here and there
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.680]   I mean Amazon is just this bad. Yeah. Well, yeah
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.600]   And in fact the people don't talk about that Amazon is in the news for this very thing
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.840]   They're being investigated by the FTC for an a competitive behavior
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.280]   As well, you know, apparently merchants are being interviewed about, you know
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.200]   The percentage of business revenue from Amazon versus other marketplace is the extent of Amazon's power over suppliers
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:24.720]   Which is all early stages, but like and I feel like in all of these cases the feeling that I get is
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:33.400]   over the overarching feeling is I'm afraid of what this may lead to I'm not quite sure what it may lead to but
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.440]   I'm afraid of how big these companies are therefore we have to do something and
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:45.160]   The same time aren't you afraid of what regulation would mean? No, no, no, and I'm not saying like that I buy into that
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.200]   I'm entirely because I think a part of me might you know just out of straight fear
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:57.000]   I think it's just driven by fear. It's like we haven't seen companies of this side and this magnitude with so much direct
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.480]   influence and kind of control over how people
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:07.720]   Connect with each other and live and live their lives in an integrated way so that uncertainty just can be scary in and of itself
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.780]   Not not but it be scary. Let me calm you down Jason
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:22.120]   I don't think there that much of control of our lives that presumes you don't have agency
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.840]   You're not making decisions on your own. Absolutely, right? Yeah
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.000]   - you think maybe the Facebook
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.760]   Investigation could be politically motivated by a certain person who hates that
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:41.000]   Washington Post maybe who also likes to get Air Force jets to land near his resorts so they can make money
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.920]   I'm not proposing, but maybe yeah, yeah, I think you're on to something there maybe
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:52.360]   Your point about being a number I'm actually gonna gonna push back a little bit on that one because as you said that it was an interesting point
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.040]   but
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   Google big giant Google
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.000]   Knows me as an individual serves me as an individual knows my preferences serves those preferences
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.680]   Throwing my own field under the bus again big old mass media still treats me as a mass
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.600]   Still treats me as as in fact a number only one of millions and giving me no
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.240]   a
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.880]   Sense of individuality and personhood and instead so in a sense. It's the algorithm is the tool that enables
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.560]   about the the personalization
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:32.720]   Individualization let's call it of these services to give me greater value and relevance as opposed to
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.640]   Big old mass media where you're just the same as everybody else. I
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.200]   buy that about
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.480]   Yeah
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.240]   So yeah, I don't know I know where this where this leads to
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.400]   Other than any many many months of discussing the progress
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.640]   cases so
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.200]   So sick of them we probably are going to get very sick of them
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.440]   The EU you know and everything that happened in the EU as far as antitrust you think that's a template here
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.480]   Do you think we're gonna see similar outcomes the wall is different?
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.040]   What you have to prove the EU could just go after you because you're just too darn big big
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.440]   Yeah, and the US you can't do that you've got to show that there was
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.500]   a proper use of a market
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.920]   Monopoly there was a monopoly be there was there was an improper use of it and see that there was harm to
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.760]   Consumers in that Europeans don't require that harm test
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.080]   Europeans you can just harm competitors and
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.140]   US you have to actually harm consumers. Okay. All right, so then maybe not as much of a template
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:52.000]   But but but Carson in this case in the Google case the consumer could be the advertiser rather than the shopper
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.280]   Yes, correct correct. Yeah
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:00.200]   Right at the wait and see gonna have the wait and see
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:06.280]   Yep, and in the meantime we need more monopoly monopolies like Google yeah
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:13.400]   Thought about that I was really you know as far as I go trying to defend the internet from from these scourge
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.320]   I thought that was a really gutsy way to put it. Yeah, it was just was to buy into it and say okay
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:27.840]   Fine monopoly good. What comes of it? Let's have more. I kind of like that. I think it was gutsy lean into the monopoly
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.920]   Lean in to monopoly you look at China
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:38.000]   How can a way ball and we chat do all the miraculous things they're dudes because they're their government?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.120]   enabled monopolies and they get enough
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.760]   consistency across the marketplace they offer phenomenal services
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:52.600]   Phenomenal yeah, it's kind of crazy what they can do absolutely
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.960]   Let's take a break when we come back. We'll talk about something that
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:03.040]   Well, I is near and dear to my heart and I think probably all of us we can talk a little bit about some of the pixel
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.920]   Leaks that are happening
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   Very similar now as they did a yes a year ago when suddenly we knew literally everything there was to know and that's kind of where
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:20.200]   We're at right now. So there's a lot of fun to be had I'm very upset. There's no Chromebook pixel leaks
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   I'm very upset. Yes
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.860]   One I'm sick. What yeah, I haven't seen anything on a pixel book
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.920]   Not not lately and I don't know I don't know I kind of assumed there was gonna be something
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.200]   I have seen anything we will talk about that and a whole lot more first
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.520]   Let's take a break. Thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in Google and that is worldwide
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.000]   Technology
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.720]   WWT began building their advanced technology center ten years ago
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.560]   It has grown exponentially ever since it's like no other testing and research lab
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.640]   The lab contains more than a half billion dollars in equipment
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:02.840]   From hundreds of OEMs and key partners ranging from heavyweights like NetApp Cisco and VMware to a emerging disruptors like Tanium
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.940]   Equinix and expanse
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:12.120]   WWT is a trusted partner who stays with you over the years many of their customers have been with them for over a decade because they know
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.680]   WWT is where they can go to get the answers. They need to make their business run right
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:23.280]   Their ATC is an incubator for IT innovation offers a number of things on demand and scheduleable
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:30.080]   Labs like NetApp cloud volumes on tap on tap on flash NetApp disaster recovery as a service
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.880]   Along with hundreds of other labs representing newest advanced advances in flash storage
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.880]   Multi-cloud hyperconverged infrastructure cloud data management and a whole lot more you learn about products before you launch
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.920]   WWT's engineers use these environments to quickly spin up proofs of concept and
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   Pilots using the sandbox so customers can confidently select the best solutions in many cases
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:58.000]   This will reduce concept time from months to weeks which increases speed to market in the end
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.280]   They offer lab as a service
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:08.480]   Which is a dedicated lab space within the ATC and this is where customers can perform programmatic testing using the vast technology ecosystem that
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:15.640]   WWT has already built and it's virtual so you can take full advantage of ATC's unique benefits anywhere in the world
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.800]   24/7
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.880]   WWT engineers work in these labs every day. They're beta testing new equipment. They're building reference architectures
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.400]   and custom integrations to help their customers make decisions and
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.440]   see results faster and with much less investment and
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.880]   The time is now
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:39.560]   WWT has finally launched their new digital platform encompassing the ATC ecosystem
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.440]   This ecosystem creates a multiplier effective knowledge speed and agility anytime
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:54.240]   Anywhere around the world for their customers so you can get access to articles case studies hands-on labs and other tools that make the difference in today's fast-paced world
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   You can learn more about
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:03.680]   WWT the ATC and sign up for access to their new on-demand lab platform by going to
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.760]   WWT.com/twit
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:13.040]   WWT simplifies the complex that's WWT.com/twit
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:20.320]   WWT is delivering business and technology outcomes around the world and we thank them for their support of this week in Google
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   All right, so we got the the big antitrust scary
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.120]   Topic out of the way. Let's get to a little bit of fun stuff here. Let's get it to all the rumors and leaks
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.640]   Yes rumors leaks and my goodness. There are many rumors and leaks actually last night and then this morning
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.200]   I've seen two full like 4k videos. Do you remember a
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.840]   Year ago before the pixel 3 we started like a month in advance ahead of the announcement
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.600]   I don't even know if the the announcement was announced yet
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.840]   You know that there would be an announcement and suddenly we started seeing these these highly produced
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.960]   Reviews of the pixel 3 that had not even been announced yet, right?
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.840]   And I think there were Ukrainian based in many in many cases
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.480]   I was thinking European but you may be right. Yeah somewhere. I can't remember exactly where I was thinking the Ukraine back
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   The Russians
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.680]   Stony and something like stony. That's right. That's right. It's like difference, but yeah, there we go. Thank you
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.400]   And it was just kind of crazy was like everybody was like well
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:31.480]   This can't possibly be real like they must be just working off a prototype or or they've created a fabrication based on rumors blah blah
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:38.840]   No, they were on Google's mailing list. Yes, something something happened there and a number of them got it because they all had content to share on YouTube
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.800]   Well now we're there again and it's happening with the pixel 4 this time
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.160]   It seems to be happening with Vietnamese youtubers
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:53.920]   At least the the two videos that have appeared in the last 24 hours are so you can find one of them by the channel and
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.400]   MTV it's a six minute video full 4k resolution. I mean it's pretty much gives you everything
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.120]   Everything you need to know about the the new pixel for
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.280]   Excel and you know kind of goes into some of the
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.960]   Features like you know the the full body design the software features the redesigned camera app
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.840]   It shows the smooth display which is a toggle so you can turn on 90 Hertz refresh instead of 60 Hertz
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.480]   Screen attention which knows when you're looking at the display to keep it on versus when you look away
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.600]   Then it will actually allow it to time out that sort of stuff
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:37.040]   I wonder about that that ambient control and you know how much juice is going to be used with that as well as with the
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.080]   Refresh rate. Yeah, I kind of the battery aspects of something like that because I know with this layer
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.640]   Yeah, I can't speak. I know with this last update to my old pixel
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:54.800]   Battery life is just going up exponentially. Okay, but I don't have all of these extra sensors and yeah
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.520]   features like this that the pixel 4 allegedly will have right the soul the solely radar
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:07.280]   How much is that gonna require are we gonna go back to bad battery life now? I hope not
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.640]   I don't I don't yeah
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:16.520]   I don't think you can go back to bad battery life like nowadays people are very used to a certain level of battery
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.520]   Performance and if you don't get it, that's going to or you're right handicapped
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:26.960]   What's that just so I so I normally drive my horribly long commute so I have the phone plugged in
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.120]   So I don't really get a sense of battery
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.520]   So I updated today. So today I've been home working working at home. I just like I call this work by the way
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.800]   and
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.720]   man they barely took a took a
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.640]   Molecule off the battery chart amazing. It's amazing
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.540]   I've forgotten to charge my battery at night a few times and you wake up and you're like
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.920]   I know it's fine and then I get to noon the next day. I'm like oh I didn't charge last night
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.880]   You know, yeah, it's it's really a big difference my 3a has gotten through two days nice
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.360]   That's fantastic. That's awesome. That's that's really good to hear and you and like you said
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:14.280]   You've noticed a difference based on what it was on pie versus where it is on Android 10 like a noticeable difference totally different
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:22.840]   That is awesome. I just I feel like battery is so important like we've all gotten somewhat more accustomed to good battery
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:28.680]   Or you know battery that that lasts long enough for that fast charge or whatever that it's really hard to go backwards on that
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.740]   It's just one of the most important key feet. We know what what caused the most of the improvement in
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.160]   10
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.120]   battery life well, that's a good question actually
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:50.000]   Would be a component I'm not running dark mode. I want it. You know that yeah, I
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.800]   Don't know, you know, I
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.040]   Nothing comes to mind as far as like and this this is the one thing that is going to improve your battery on your device
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.440]   I just think they're always improving it. You know, they're always coming up with ways to
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.680]   Wisely throttle down certain aspects of the phone there is not using certain things if it happens to be you know
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.880]   The dose mode from a couple of years ago, which maybe is not even called those
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.840]   That's right. I don't even know if it's still called those but you know that I think has improved over the last couple of years
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.160]   So that when it's sitting on a table, it's just sipping right on on your battery
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   So is your fear that that now that the pixel 4 is going to be always awake looking for your your gestures and stuff
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:36.880]   You just keep using more juice now. That's my opinion. Yeah, I mean I would I would hope especially with the solely
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:47.040]   Sensor like I I'm hoping that they've done enough with that to kind of dial in a very nice kind of low-energy
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.020]   Mode that to go along with that, but I don't know how realistic that is. I think it's a radar. I don't eat how how battery
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:59.720]   Yeah thirsty is a radar. You know, that's that's that's part of your phone. I have no idea to be honest
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.280]   I noticed just this morning with 10
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:09.800]   Is when I pull down my notification screen it actually says one day
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.560]   Three hours on my battery. Oh wow
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.720]   When you pull down your note like it says when I when I pull down the notifications
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.320]   Uh-huh it says at the at the top right hand. It says one day
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.040]   Three hours so it's actually and and this morning. It said one day when I when I woke up
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:34.240]   It said one day six hours and that was so it's like that was eight at six hours ago
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   So okay, I'm gaining time
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:43.440]   Beautiful. Yeah, I wonder what's going on there. That's interesting
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.760]   Um
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:55.660]   So yeah, so we so we see the devices leaking entirely and I imagine you know Google at some point here very soon has to announce their event, right?
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:02.120]   Like it would help us out. They did a really guy would help us. All right. We want to know we just schedule it for sure
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.680]   but
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.000]   It just it just it's interesting to me that a couple of months ago
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.800]   We started seeing some of these major leaks and immediately Google comes out and says yep
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.880]   That's it, you know, it's like they embraced the leak and they were like yes
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.960]   Let's not you know try and pretend like it didn't happen
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.600]   Let's embrace it and they were applauded for that like people were like yeah, that's doing it right
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.040]   We're but I'm the cynic. I still say that they're sending it you think that you think that this is all intentional
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.920]   It's all yeah, that's that's the next level of marketing. Yeah, okay
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:41.000]   So you're saying that Google is sending out things to rabbit TV
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   Yes, Thailand yes
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:50.080]   Because you guess that's that's the station that just next year me Peru you go totally totally
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   Rabbit TV 50 subscribers by the way, I think this is tie. Yeah, it looks totally obscure. Yes
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.720]   So yeah, I think this I think this is stuff sneaking out of their new factory in Vietnam
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   Yeah, oh
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:17.480]   They're moving stuff out of China and and so now they've got whole new security issues to deal with
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.520]   And so they got phones walking out of walking out of their head and think about Vietnam. Okay. Do you think do you think Google?
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.320]   enjoys this sort of press oh
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   Yeah, any press is good press, right? Yeah
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:36.160]   Maybe oh yeah like I'm always kind of curious like obviously people are talking about it everything
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.680]   But it but then again like I'm not inside the company orchestrating this grand like release schedule
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.160]   I think I mean at this point you just kind of assume if you're in that position that something's going to leak or that this is going to happen
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.200]   I think they would enjoy this especially when you have a huge competitor
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.400]   Just up the road
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.240]   That's you know what that's a really good point when you talk about timing all right to full money videos
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:09.240]   Hitting YouTube literally a day after Apple's huge event time. There's some interesting timing there
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.360]   I hadn't even considered that and that's not the first time this happened. They did that last you totally
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:20.480]   It's I think you might be right actually there's some really kind of interesting time when marketing
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.420]   Yeah, that's what they're teaching at Stanford. That's
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.080]   You'd learn a thing or two from the Ukrainian leakers from last year
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.880]   And then other things that we know now as far as what's going to be
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.040]   offered on these devices there is
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.960]   There was news last week
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:47.080]   I think it was that assistant would be able to step in for you when you're on a phone calling you to put someone and someone
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.800]   That someone puts you on hold so we'll be with you in ten minutes or whatever
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.240]   They put you on hold instead of you sitting there with a phone
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.720]   You can assign assistant to sit in your place
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.760]   Brilliant to the happy music to they have
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:08.760]   Welcome to 2019. It's nice to have something futuristic finally. Yeah, yes. Yes
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.560]   I know it's kind of like it's like it's like beating them with their at their own game
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.640]   It's like you put me on hold I put you on hold then they come on and then they get the automated responses
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.960]   It says you're on hold please hold on Jason will be with you shortly or whatever. You don't hold
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.040]   Yes, I don't hold for you you hold for me
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.680]   No one puts puts me in the corner
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:37.160]   Also updates to night mode to include the ability to take shots of the nighttime sky
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.040]   That's a sorry sky. That's a tough feet computational
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.800]   Photography Google has done that like no one else and night mode has been really really good
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.280]   And you're telling me there's gonna be an improvement to something that's already really really good
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.840]   Yeah, I can't wait to see that. Yeah, and of course Apple, you know in their iPhone
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.240]   They introduced yesterday their kind of night mode upgrade and looks looks really good
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.200]   Looks like a really good result
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.160]   So I'll be you know like I can already see the shoot outs. Mm-hmm
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.740]   The shoot out article videos that are you know like comparing the two
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:20.440]   And you have shoot out right and I have much faith in Google's ability to impress with their night mode
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   And just with the camera in general
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:32.640]   The last time I was on this week in tech the fact that Google was was getting this type of performance out of a camera
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:39.440]   That has one lens. Mm-hmm. You know, oh, yeah now they're getting multiple points is I I can't wait
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.960]   Yeah, I'm curious to see what what the secret sauce is, you know, yeah
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:49.400]   So much of what they were doing a a yes the quality of the one lens that they were using
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:57.280]   The sensor in there but but be so much of that is just the computational aspect and so you add more lens
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.760]   Combinations and more information and everything for Google to play with
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   That's gonna be a big deal. I can't wait, so I'm looking forward to that
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.520]   I think the the improved night mode will be cool
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.800]   I went on a hiking trip a couple weeks ago and while I was there in the mountains have this beautiful night sky with
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.280]   With stars and super clear and everything I was laying out on a rock and I took my
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.480]   My pixel 3
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.520]   XL and put it in night mode and propped it up, you know on the rock and had to like very carefully touch the
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.280]   The shutter button although so you know, I didn't want it. Yeah, I didn't want it to shake at all
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   I could use the hardware button, but then it would shake so I had to like set it up just perfectly
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.320]   I ended up getting a pretty decent nighttime shot it
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.480]   I think it held the shutter open for like 10 seconds trying to let in all that light
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   And you can actually see the stars there was no smearing and everything and it looked decent there
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.960]   Let alone what improvement might make where maybe you could pull in, you know
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:59.480]   You know more details of like the Milky Way or whatever those like subtle right shifts that you see up in the sky less really serious
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   A lot less noise. Yep. It's gonna be nice. Yeah, you do know that there's a countdown on your shutter, right?
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.400]   Count down on my shutter. What do you mean? Oh, so I could take it and like do like a timed
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.560]   Yeah, I didn't think about that I didn't think about that I
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.400]   Was
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.480]   Really
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:34.040]   Just sand is mr. Good idea karsten is mr. Mr. Laport listening photo show maybe I
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.880]   Think you have some information to share here
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.800]   Also a new motion mode for the camera for fast plane that would you yes?
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.880]   Okay, well, I mean as far as I can tell from the rumor anyways is that you know fast action
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:58.080]   Motion stuff like you know in this in this screenshot someone playing you know football player or whatever
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.560]   a
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.920]   That the camera could actually take that shot and capture it
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:11.560]   Clearly and be being able to it makes comment of being able to blur the background have a sharp foreground
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:19.120]   To get that like stretched across the field DSLR shot where everything impression. Yes
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.960]   So I don't know I don't know how it's going to pull that off because right now like that just that just
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.520]   Computational it's computational you know right now we do that in a standard portrait mode
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   But that requires you to be pretty close to the lens in order to pull it off
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.640]   So how do you do that when you're shooting a football player all the way over there on the field?
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.160]   I have no idea yeah, I
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.600]   Having that extra set of lenses is definitely going to help from a you know optics standpoint, but yeah
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:52.120]   I'm still putting my my chips on the computational side of processing it for sure you know it because it's a standard
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:38:00.680]   Process a lot of photographers are doing every day and Google Google can use their you know machine learning to figure all of that stuff out and say
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.720]   Hey, this is what most sports illustrated photographers are doing
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.580]   So let's see if we can mimic that no different from any other
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:14.640]   Engine is going to try wouldn't it be cool if the phone in your pocket could eat well the camera of the sports illustrator photographer
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.240]   That's probably where a lot of Google's conversations around the start and they say it's small they have that right okay
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:28.560]   Okay, we can do that what can we do to make that happen and the phone you know similar to the iPhone that has the kind of square
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   The iPhone 11
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.480]   You know the whole series has the square camera array on the back
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.560]   Some of them have two cameras back there some of them have three
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:43.720]   The Google camera is square as well. I believe it's gonna have three cameras right?
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.560]   It's gonna have that means three and then a flash three and then a flash
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.200]   So one of those is gonna be some sort of a zoom some sort of an optical
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:57.240]   Telephoto so that might come in handy for something like this right in order to get a little closer
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   Don't be shy
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.680]   With the Google Pixel
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   I will say I was never a fan of portrait mode on
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.480]   Either of the platforms whether it's iOS or Google. I was never really a fan because
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.720]   most people took the portrait mode to too quickly and
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.560]   They screwed with the details, you know it would blur out
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.880]   Ear and stuff like that and that's because everybody's just thinking all right let me get that selfie real quick
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   And they tap it not necessarily
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:35.760]   Considering you need to be still and let the AI think for a second. Okay. This is what before you hit the shutter, right?
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:42.600]   See I never even considered that it even I want to say at one point it would tell you hey hold still or
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:49.280]   Okay, and then hit you because you're right because the AI needs a little probably needs a little bit of time
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.100]   You'll be able to analyze the scene and know what it's about to do
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.260]   Portrait mode it'll it'll have you take the picture and then
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.440]   Move it move your camera just a little bit up. Yeah
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.320]   So that so that it can get that depth of field and for information
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.800]   I don't think you're gonna have to do that with two lenses
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.080]   Because you'll have the one lens you have the additional hard
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:19.080]   You have the triangulation you need exactly I don't feel like I ever have to move my phone though when I do portrait mode
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:26.200]   See every time I've looked at it because I'm I try not to use it because I struggled with getting the perfect focus on whatever
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.440]   The subject is and most time I just fix it and post myself. Yeah, but it tells you hey you need to hold still
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.520]   All right, find your focal point. Okay now shoot and if you're off just by an inch
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:44.680]   It it the process and gets messed up. Yeah, everyone's I do know what you what you mean when like a portrait mode shot goes bad
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.680]   Mm-hmm goes awry, you know everything
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:54.040]   Like relax your eyes you're like oh that does look like a DSLR and then when you really look at those edges
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.120]   You see that tiny little sliver of sharpness
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.320]   Coming through or it just looks like a bad photoshop around the edge or something like that
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.600]   So I know what you mean
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.000]   I've just never noticed in the camera UI that it's ever told me to like shift the camera or
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.560]   Typically says like focus here or something like that. I remember way back when a couple of years ago
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:19.800]   There was a there was a portrait mode that acted entirely off of the oh, yeah
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.400]   I do remember that yeah
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.600]   Where it was like take it and then it actually guided you like lift your phone and then that was how it
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.440]   Figured out what I need to figure out and thankfully it doesn't do that anymore
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:36.000]   Maybe that's what I was thinking about yeah, yeah, I don't know if there's much of that anymore
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.800]   I'm still still using it. Yeah, what are you using steam-powered?
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.520]   He's gonna be next to six
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.160]   The Nexus 1A
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.280]   That doesn't even exist or the yes, right
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.920]   so
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   Any who um
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:59.560]   I don't know I'm excited and we'll continue to be excited because this is probably the next phone that I'm gonna call my own pricing
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.920]   pricing
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.400]   We're looking at another thousand dollar phone folks
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:10.760]   How could how could it not be in that high range of Apple Apple to Apple just play a little game by lowering their price a little bit
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.600]   They did lower the phone up prices, right? I
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:21.560]   Or slightly lower. Yeah, they I don't think that they shifted too money mentally, but um
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:26.680]   But still I mean they have you know over a thousand dollar versions of of the iPhone
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.400]   So we're at a point of no return when it comes to phone pricing. Oh, oh, no the way
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.840]   I yeah, I don't know that we're at a point of no return, but we're not at a point of it stopping
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.400]   You know the note 10 is still
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   Like they have two versions of the note 10 now
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.160]   And the lower cost one is still three digits
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.080]   The higher cost one is four digits. So they're still like
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:56.600]   It's still that that point that price point that they want to get in on and I kind of see google shooting for that as well because they're gonna have
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.440]   the the solely radar on board that they can say you know
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:07.240]   Is so incredibly valuable and the multiple cameras and the fact that it's our premium phone and
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.400]   So yeah, I don't I don't see why not but I would love to see it a little bit less
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.000]   Of course. I'm so tired of thousand dollar phones. Yeah
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.920]   Yeah, but you know what so how much should you spend for that laptop or does somebody spend for you for that laptop?
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.560]   And it is a laptop. Uh, I think this one was about
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.320]   2200 somewhere in that area right and you use the phone
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.640]   far more
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.680]   And you use laptop. Let's see. Let me say this
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.160]   I think I mentioned to you with the note that it it's sort of
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:44.520]   Validates its pricing because of all the extra like AR stuff that they have built in even though it failed for you
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:50.680]   Didn't work very well for the three-dimensional the three-dimensional rendering that that it was trying to do
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.120]   That's a lot of competition need power needed in a phone
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:58.520]   So that justifies the price because you try to do 3d work on the laptop
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:05.320]   You need to spend you know a couple thousand dollars more than likely to get graphics processing and so forth. Okay. Um, so
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.200]   Yeah, that phone I use it all the time, but it still doesn't justify
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:16.040]   A thousand dollars when all it's doing is is pictures and a little bit of post-processing for me
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:21.560]   I can't render video the way I would like to or render graphics the way I would like to you know, but
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:28.280]   Samsung give them credit. They're trying to you know bring something to the table. Mm-hmm. This that says all right
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:34.120]   We got all this horsepower. Let's use it. Yeah Samsung brings a lot to the table sometimes a little too much kind of like
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.080]   Because I think that so many consumers would would buy one of their phones and yes
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   It offers all these things including like what you're talking about 3d modeling
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:48.440]   But who's gonna do that the majority of no users are never gonna do that most people or not
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:54.120]   But I know creators that would love to be able to have an object sitting right here on the table
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:59.640]   Be able to digitize it. Yeah digitize it and put it into the next project that they're working on for a client
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.080]   Yeah, both for sure within minutes, you know for sure big
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:09.800]   That would be nice. So yes, I do I do think though that we're looking at around a thousand dollars for the top of
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.000]   Sadly that would be that would be my guess here
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Um, and then right right before the show I read an article
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.760]   by ryan witwam at uh android police
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.040]   Who wrote about how the apple watch series five
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:31.560]   Is just showing how how much of an embarrassment wear o s has become over the years the apple watch continues to just dominate
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:37.560]   As far as wearables are concerned where is still is this yes, where o s still exists in fact that uh ifa
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.360]   uh was a
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.560]   fossil
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.680]   Announced five different sub brands Michael cores
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.880]   Standing our money
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.920]   All these updates of fashion watches essentially we're talking about this on all that android last night that
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:59.320]   Wear o s has really become the platform for fashion watches because that's all you really see happening in wear o s anymore
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.920]   Samsung has moved to ties in for their their major watches the other technology
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.480]   You know manufacturers of phones. They all tried their thing with smart watches
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.280]   They might put out one smart watch here and there but they're not as focused on as they used to be
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.760]   And that might not be a bad thing because they were just creating phones on your wrist
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.200]   You know, they weren't very good looking which people require in a watch
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.880]   So okay fine. So then it's fashion fashion brands that have an o s platform to put
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:34.360]   You know on their smart watch lineup. I need to look into that a little more because I like watches as jewelry
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.320]   Um, I actually have a watch if I don't have it on today
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:42.040]   But I normally wear a watch as jewelry and I've always wanted something that looked good
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.600]   But also I had the simplicity of telling time
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.520]   And and giving me a few notifications here and there
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.720]   You know and the companies that were able to do that
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.600]   They're no longer here because they didn't look good. You know, but what was that right?
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   What was that watch company? Um
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.640]   And I think they got bought out by google but from all of the functionality it was there
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.680]   Just simple notifications, but when you looked at the watch it looked like the old school casio
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.720]   Right
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:18.680]   Nobody wants to wear that as a piece of jewelry. Are you thinking about pebble pebble? That's it. Okay. All right
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.720]   Pebble did a good job. And so look at the apple watch
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.920]   Do you like the square kind of aesthetic of the apple watch?
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:32.120]   I would I wouldn't necessarily say that I find the apple watch 100 like the most that the perfect look of a smart watch
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.720]   But I think it's better than what we've seen in the past
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:40.360]   I still like the square. Okay, especially the larger face because it looks better on
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.720]   A wrist with larger hands. Yeah, what phone do you carry? Yeah? Uh, this is a pixel
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.680]   Two, I think or three one of them
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.040]   So you're you're an android. Yes, sir
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   It's a pixel something something
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.960]   Pixel 4
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.440]   I will wait until the pricing goes down. Yeah, I don't want to do a thousand dollars
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.840]   I can't justify that google if if history has shown
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:13.000]   Uh, show taught us anything google definitely discounts the prices on their pixel if you're willing to wait a couple of months
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.360]   And give it four months something like that. It's what I could just sit under the o's desk and hope he did just drops up because
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.160]   Well, yeah, that will happen
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.160]   Yeah
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:29.480]   Yeah, you know you work a twit now that very well could happen that could actually happen
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:35.160]   That is a scenario that has I have seen a zero percent chance. I've seen it from afar. I'm a whining
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.200]   Deep whining
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.480]   That's how it goes
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.760]   Uh, and so you Jeff based on what you've heard as far as the pixel
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.160]   I may have asked this last time because I feel like the pixel 4 comes up every time i'm on the show my apologies
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   If I talk about it too much, but what do you think? Well, I'm gonna talk about what I talk about too much
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.600]   Uh, which is that for my limited budget
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.560]   My blessed and I love it
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.720]   Pixelbook is gonna go and I'm a shy fear soon. I need a new
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:11.800]   Highest end Chromebook. So that's where my money is gonna go. So I'm very happy with the 3a. Yeah, very excel. Yeah, 3a excel
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.280]   3a excel. Pixelbook has been serviceable for you for you, right? Oh supposed to perp
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.360]   I've been on
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:26.520]   Sorry, I don't know when the when the first not the original google pixel or google chroma came out
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.880]   But but I've been on this probably for four years three four years now, right?
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:36.760]   And this is the original one the one that's like kind of has like a metal like a dark array metal casing or is it
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:41.320]   Pixelbook? Well, it does but it's it's like that. It's yours. Oh, okay. Okay. So this is a company
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.520]   I had the prior one. But this is two years old. I think right? Uh, yeah
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.320]   Yeah, this one is two years old last year was the slate this and then before that
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:56.600]   Did they skip a year and then prior to that they had the so I remember in a chromebook pixel chromebook pixel
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:03.320]   Yeah, I think they went pixel pixelbook after that. I believe this. Oh, yeah. No, that's that's definitely the direction that it went
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:09.080]   So, um, yeah, I mean, I'm on the pixel book obviously right now and I like god
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:14.280]   Who was it that asked me here a couple of days ago? I think Anthony asked me like are you are you itching to upgrade?
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.960]   I'm like I don't feel like I need to like this thing's still rocking two years later like
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:24.440]   I can't I can't tell you of a situation where I've opened it and been like oh this thing is so old like it's it's fine
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:31.240]   Right, it never reminds me there. There's never a reminder that it's that it's two years old. It's like totally fine unlike the slate
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.560]   Well, the slate was was your bane slate had its own issues
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.840]   And I wouldn't necessarily say like it being outdated and slow was was one of them
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:45.080]   It was just from a usability standpoint. It was just it just didn't make a whole lot of sense
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.960]   So I'm happy to be back on the pixel book, but
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:53.000]   I I would imagine that they're gonna have a pixel book update for you jeff
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   I think that's gonna happen not good for me reach behind you. No, I'm good
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.640]   I feel I feel good about it though
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.880]   Would has been knocked all right. Let's take a break. We'll thank the sponsor of this episode
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.160]   And then we'll get into some of these other this this mishmash of news
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:13.560]   Because there is some news in here. There's just aren't a whole lot of like stand out
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:19.720]   News pieces. So if anything jumps out at you, maybe maybe take a look over the rundown and be like oh, this is a story
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:24.760]   We got to talk about and I found I found a new instagram account with a little tiny dog that carries big sticks
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.240]   We could do that. Oh
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.720]   I think I saw that video or I saw one of them where the dog was trying to get through the little passageway and kept
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.360]   A lot of those are dumb dogs. This one this one makes it through
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.440]   No, no, that's what I mean and eventually right like yeah, he's trying to
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:43.480]   Figure it out. We can do that. We don't need news. We can do dogs with sticks if I knew that was an option
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.280]   Man, this rundown would look a lot different dogs just
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:52.360]   Always an option. All right, good to know I'll put that in my bank for next week next time I'm on

[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.680]   I'm not really doing a whole lot of instagram these days
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:50.040]   These days, but I saw this one and I stuck with it because it took about a minute for the dog to to get through
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.280]   Are you seeing it kerson? Oh, okay
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:57.080]   Okay, he's he's logging in he's liking it. He's subscribing. I

[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:04.600]   Uh, this is what has an entire account. I didn't realize that when I saw the tweet
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.640]   I just thought it was a funny video, but no you can follow this dog
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.200]   Uh day and night. This is what happens when apple has an announcement
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.480]   As we can google turns into dog videos
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.960]   Uh, but it really is great
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:23.080]   Bosco really wants to get through these pillars. You gotta let people see how Bosco gets through
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.600]   Do it you guys go
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:32.920]   Look at him go
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.560]   And i'm out of here
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:41.960]   Kinda reminds me of uh of the uh the grinch the dog in the grinch with the
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.920]   The vogue reindeer. Yeah, the reindeer horn
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:51.000]   Bosco's cool. Now while we're on this, okay, the other one to look up uh kerson is my aussie gal
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.200]   My underscore aussie underscore gal
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.440]   Uh, there's one of the dog doing jenga. You seen this?
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.960]   No, i've not seen this. Yeah, the jenga the jenga dog then we'll okay just
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.760]   So does someone work with their dog for like weeks and months on end to to this young
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.400]   And then more creative video
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.320]   These are really smart dog. These australian shippers really smart the one right there right jenga right there
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   So you can go to jenga
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.800]   Okay, now it's a dog
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.880]   Sorry, audio listeners. There is a dog
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.000]   Panting at a stacked jenga tower
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.800]   Pulling a piece
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.280]   Slowly no it is it is that dog's just really good at playing this
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   Is going really really slow because when you play jenga, you don't want to just want to like tug
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.200]   How on earth what
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.400]   I'm struggling just to stop kylo from eating my socks and this kid this dog is playing jenga
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.160]   Oh, that is amazing
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:56.600]   This was the famous dog but down up and down the hill and its own sled, but well, that's for winter
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:02.280]   All right. All right. We made up for apple pond. So apparently I need to get get on instagram
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.760]   We're often and subscribe to accounts like these
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:11.720]   Think this old verbedial stuff is bad see what you're missing. I know I feel it. I feel it
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:17.240]   Should I should I then point out that uh that there was a nasty like instagram
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:23.560]   Thing that was going around that uh basically an easy hack using html and a browser
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:30.200]   That was like the hack has always been a screen. You can do a screenshot. That's what they said. That's what facebook said
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.240]   Yeah, they said yeah, it's basically the same as like doing a screenshot
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:37.800]   It's like well, no, it's linking to the actual file that's hidden behind a private
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:46.680]   I mean, it's weird rebylines on this or treating this like in some big investigation that you could you share a photo with somebody
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.760]   They could actually share it with somebody else
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.560]   No
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.120]   I mean, I see I see what you're saying like I don't follow it
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.360]   Isn't it just someone taking a screenshot and resharing it? No, so what it is is
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:04.600]   Using html very able to get a link like okay if I follow someone's private account
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.200]   I can get their image using html I can take the link to that image and share it with someone else who is not following that account
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:16.120]   And they can they can link to it. So it's basically the same
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   Or you could just take a screenshot
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:25.080]   Basically the same world around right but because it's linking to something that should be behind a wall that prevents people outside
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.840]   That becomes the story. I guess it took three bylines to do come on buzzfeed
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.000]   You said it will forever be my techno pennant
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.400]   No, patters
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.440]   And Stacy's not here to yell out before
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.800]   What did you guys think about facebook dating?
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:49.320]   That would be no that would be no, I don't know. No, I'm not using it. I can't use it. Yeah. No, I mean, okay
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:55.160]   None of us is using facebook dating for those who aren't aware basically facebook
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.360]   is rolling out the dating app in the u.s
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.320]   Of course, you know the taking on the likes of like ton
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:08.520]   tinder tinder tumble tunder bimbo all of those
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:15.640]   Matches will not include your facebook friends. So that could have been awkward
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.120]   They are not allowing that to happen
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.280]   Also, there's an option to limit to only people where no friends are in common
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.920]   So really I think the big privacy kind of
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:30.120]   Potential here is you're on facebook dating. You don't want your friends or people who know
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.080]   People who know you to know that you are on there for there to be some awkward moment where
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.560]   Something meets someone then you realize oh wait a minute
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:42.920]   You're so-and-so's brother or whatever, you know, I can appreciate facebook trying to
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.280]   to
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:49.480]   Cut the web a little bit so it's not not as interconnected, but yeah, it's I got a hunch
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.200]   That's still gonna come back and bite you in the butt, you know
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.840]   Probably bite somebody in the butt
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.680]   I don't know how many people that's gonna bite you there's so many people on facebook
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.080]   Yeah, so many people that are connected
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:08.680]   That don't realize they're connected because that's true mr. Jarvis has my contact information and
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:13.720]   He has mr. Stacey's contact information, but mr. Stacey doesn't have mine
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.760]   But now she could probably get my contact information because of mr. Jarvis and yeah, you know it
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:25.880]   Why wouldn't this be any different with the facebook dating thing because there's so many people out there and it's so many ways to draw that
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:31.640]   Yeah connection the interconnectivity the six degrees of separation six degrees of kevin bacon
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.800]   Oh, what do you want to call it?
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.920]   There's apparently a secret crush mode or feature
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.680]   You can only you can you have a limit of nine crushes
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:46.200]   Right and that's the kind of feature where like I add you as a crush you add me as a crush
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.920]   We are both revealed to each other as being crushed
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:55.160]   You know having a crush on each other and yay, we can fall in love and live happily ever after
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.320]   I don't know it's interesting as a business of this
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.840]   Match.com stock went down. I think I saw five percent last week. Oh, wow, you know with this coming out
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.880]   Uh, it really was the only game out there and you look at it's another thing newspapers used to have
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.440]   Yeah, Prischel's ants
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.480]   Yeah, yeah for those days. I remember those
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   Hey kids. Hey kids in my day
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.200]   I didn't sleep to find somebody
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.760]   Turn the page
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.200]   Classified ad for dating
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.440]   But it's true. It was a whole section that doesn't really it was it was huge
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.720]   It was well wasn't huge money. It wasn't like jobs, but it was it was sizable money for publication, especially alternative
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.080]   Absolutely
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.440]   And uh, and that's all gone now and so facebook's going into a
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.560]   basically monopoly market
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.720]   With match.com and now we'll see what happens. Yep
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.960]   Yep, well, we are old enough to remember
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   When online dating had kudos
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.040]   Had kudos like playing you don't do it people. Yeah, you didn't do it. No, you know
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:05.400]   You obviously found someone from you just simply from your charm illuminating the streets as you walk down
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.040]   and there there
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   I knew
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.520]   Who lived in japan when she left that was the case when she came back
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.920]   Everyone of her friends had found their mates with online days. She got looked around and said wow what happened
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.440]   and and the the the norm
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.840]   Um just changed like overnight. Yeah, it really did
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:30.040]   And it makes perfect sense. You you know, you don't have enough people in your pool
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.680]   You're busy working all day. You don't want to date, you know there
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.720]   And and so to find new people it made perfect sense the way to use it and it lost its kudos
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:43.240]   Quick. Yeah, interesting. No, I I know exactly I I remember that uh
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:43.960]   96
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:48.600]   I can't remember if I already told this story on this I have this like weird deja vu that I already told it on on this
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.520]   We can google but in 96. I met my girlfriend in irc
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.280]   And she lived in montreal. I lived in idaho and boyc where both
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.080]   And were you both geographically undesirable?
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.520]   Well, but she had dual citizenship and so so we like
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.800]   You know got to know each other over the course of a couple of months
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.840]   Online and eventually, you know kind of talking to each other and everything and then she invited me out to montreal
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.920]   And at no time had we ever exchanged photos of each other
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.800]   We were just kind of trusting that we were telling the truth
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.960]   Right and this was 96
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.960]   And so when I told my family that I was you're gonna get on a plane and go to montreal and meet this girl
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.240]   I'd never see a picture of you know that I met on the internet which was very
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:35.640]   New to most people at that point in the shock and horror. Oh, yeah friends and family were like you're gonna get murdered
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.720]   Right, you know
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:42.760]   It was like such a stretch for me to do that but um the perfect lifetime movie
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.880]   Right. I wouldn't have ended up at san francisco. Yes
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.080]   Of the times I wouldn't have ended up in san francisco had I not done that right?
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.360]   Most of the way is that your phone with my wife
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.520]   I was still I was I was in a long-distance relationship with my wife over the phone in 1996
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.600]   So I was I you you were out of me sir
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.760]   Oh, wow
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:11.160]   Jason was that was it was the end of the story that you buried her or no no no no
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.280]   Okay, well
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   History of my day
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.400]   San Francisco, so I missed right right. Yeah, I kind of skipped to there basically
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:28.680]   Basically everything went well. She had dual citizenship. I ended up doing a six-month work visa in montreal
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.040]   Montreal was amazing
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.080]   But then once that was up, it was like what we're gonna live somewhere that we can both live if we want to continue dating
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.480]   Right, she tried Boise but coming from Montreal Boise was not necessarily a step up
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.080]   But I give her props for trying and then we chose san francisco. We were like san francisco sounds awesome
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   We ended up san francisco. We broke up probably a year later. She's still one of my best friends
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.920]   All right. Yeah, oh that's cool. That's how that all came around
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.360]   But I would not be in san francisco had I not met her in irc chat
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.640]   Is that like it is one of those like those what is it the swinging doors or rotating doors? What is that?
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.840]   that guinna paltrow movie
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.680]   Which is like sliding doors sliding doors there we go
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.400]   You either go this way or that way and it changes your entire life and that's what that piracy chat was
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:22.200]   Anyways, wow that was actually interesting. I know what I had heard that on this show. Okay, I wasn't sure
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:27.320]   Um, well there you go. There's a little piece of my my dating history for you
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.880]   But I do remember how how like how people were very worried for me
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.720]   They really thought like I was gonna go there and get murdered. Yeah, don't blame. I can't blame them
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.160]   Yeah, I mean at that point
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.920]   You just weren't doing that and that that I think is my point for even bringing it up at that point
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:46.440]   Dating online was so such a foreign concept. I just didn't do that. I guarantee you
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   Uh, classified ads dating was way more natural and normal
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.560]   Right and you at least know that one but that was considered somewhere. Yeah
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.920]   What's that? Just last fight ads last fight ads dating had kudos
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.000]   Oh
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   To at that time as well
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.400]   You did. Yeah, but there's also a time of
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.720]   Um, what was the name of the movie looking for mr. Goodbar the novel and movie diane heaten
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:15.400]   Okay, and so yes, it was diane heaten plays a woman who ends up dating people in bars and I think gets murdered
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.560]   Yes, sorry is always enough with murder. Oh, it's comes back around the murder
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.240]   Show title dang it
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.840]   It always comes back to yeah, there's some seo magic there
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.560]   Hey looking for mr. Goodbar
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.120]   She teaches deaf children during the day but cruises single bars and discos at night
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:42.040]   So eventually gets married family fun for everyone never
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.080]   Uh two stars
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:50.040]   The likes of tony richard gear who's threatening knife and swagger excite her
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.440]   This is the danger that lurks out there in bars where women go
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.640]   That was that was the that was the view back in the day. Okay
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.680]   Now looking for mr. Good swipe, you know, yes
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.680]   That might be the title actually
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.960]   I like that one a little better
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   Uh
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.160]   That was good
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.920]   Uh, let's see here some some pieces and everything google assistant
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.880]   um
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:23.880]   Apparently on some devices is going to going to enable a new feature ambient mode. So if you have a smart
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.480]   uh
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:31.400]   Smart screen or smart home screen, uh, like the nest hub max that just released as one example
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:37.800]   Uh, then you know you have a certain interface and and you know, it allows you to do lots of things like with your your weather
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.320]   Notifications reminders music controls all that kind of smart home controls
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:47.800]   Well now uh apparently to some devices for now the assistant is going to enable ambient mode
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.840]   Which will basically turn phones and tablets into that which makes a lot of sense. I like that
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.560]   Yeah, I like that gives you a simplified interface for when it's just sitting on the counter
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.760]   If it's connected to some of your other stuff. I dig that
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.640]   Yeah, I like you have like a dog. Do you put your phone in?
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.360]   And uh, as I know I yeah, I have a doc that I use at the desk here
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:15.560]   And it's it would be nice to be able to just sit it there and as i'm listening to music and have my music controls a little bit bigger
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.880]   Bigger than that tiny little touchpoint or
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.240]   Yep, I dig that. Yeah
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:26.040]   Um, I think it's one of those things. It's like, oh, why didn't you do that sooner?
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.680]   That makes a whole lot of sense. Although I do remember years ago on android when you docked
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:37.560]   It used to have what was the name? Was it daydream mode? It was daydream mode. Yeah, that was kind of like
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.880]   It is going back
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.520]   But it was kind of like this when you had it plugged in you had it on you're like your phone charging doc or whatever
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.600]   It would go into daydream mode and it would turn into
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.840]   almost like an ambient light going on a digital like uh
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.400]   Picture frame or whatever and I remembered it and you could have my nipples around that
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.440]   Like that think it was my nixes. I probably was
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.800]   Yeah, it probably was about that time
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.520]   Right now for now it's launching on select Lenovo tablets and Nokia phones
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.200]   I guess we'll see if it comes to other devices as well, but
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.080]   Um, does any one of us have one of those smart screens like I have google homes
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.880]   But I don't have any with a screen in my house. Do you? I do
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.840]   I do if we use it. I have never used it
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.240]   I have an Alexa little little
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:30.120]   Whatever dot the show no not the show the the five inch their little five inch screen
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.760]   There it is. Yeah, that's the little is that the Lenovo one. Yeah, I wish I wish I had this wall or google one
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   Yeah, well that was the first one and that was and still it was a great device
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.840]   And either of the have that I'm not how heavy it
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.120]   Thankfully it just sits there. I'd rather have that large one
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.400]   I remember looking at the google one and thinking it's no bigger than my tablet, you know
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:56.040]   Yeah, it's just I could do the same thing just right mount the tablet somewhere
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.400]   Right, but you wouldn't get the interface now you will now I will
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.400]   Potentially potentially it's possible. We'll see
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:12.840]   Um, what else is in here? Oh, there's stuff in here there. Okay. Go for what what's something that grabs you right now?
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.400]   Jeff is there something? Oh, no, I should have said that but we
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400]   I
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.600]   Will deflect to you
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.560]   Um, google looks one. No, it's changelog never mind. Go get to that
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.320]   Well, you could I'll tell you what why don't you play the trumpets then I'll find something
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.680]   Oh, okay. Yeah, why don't we do that? Let's let's play some trumpets the end of the show
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.280]   We can do that whenever we want right? We can do that. It's time for the changelog
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.960]   the google changelog
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.800]   Google is changing the no follow link attribute. That's right. We're digging deep this time around
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:53.000]   Uh used to be a flag to tell a search ranking to ignore those links
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.720]   Now it's simply going to be treated as a hint
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.880]   About which which links to exclude so you could flag a link as a sponsored
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.960]   Uh, you know, riel equals sponsored that would idea as part of an ad or a sponsorship and tell the search
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:13.480]   The search engine, you know that give it a hint as far as what it is whether it wants to include it in its results or not
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:19.160]   ugc would identify links for user-generated content things like comments forum posts that sort of stuff
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.440]   Google did say that it's going to continue to honor no follow attributes currently in place
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:30.520]   So no need to change your existing ones quite yet on march 2020 all no follow links
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.360]   Will be treated as hints and not specific like
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:40.760]   Actions to ignore these links. So I don't know that kind of seems like a big change right before
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.480]   People had control over what the search engine sees and now not so much
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.040]   A big change to who
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.040]   No, that's true
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.600]   That's true. No, I get it
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.960]   Again, you start thinking about market and standpoint. It makes sense. It does. Yeah
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.560]   Uh
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:05.640]   Google chrome 77 is rolling out and offers a new feature for sharing pages between devices
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.280]   So basically if you're on
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.840]   One device and you want to share a web page to your phone like you're leaving the house, you know, this whole thing
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.520]   I feel like we've had this solution before but maybe it was in the way of an app or whatever
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.280]   Well, now it's going to be built into chrome. You could right click on a tab
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:27.560]   Choose the device to share to and then that device will appear on the on that device the tab will appear
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.800]   You have to tap to receive it. I like that
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.200]   So it's like you have to accept that link before it will just appear there once you do that there it is
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.280]   I like that. I like that. I've done
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.240]   I've been working on a project or what have you in
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.280]   And wanted to take a break if you will
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.520]   And so I would
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.920]   Say all right. I'm going to go downstairs or something like that
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.280]   But i'm just going to take this with me while I go downstairs
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:56.440]   Yeah, so much that would be a nice easy feature just the right can't you go to the history on either device and see the other device
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.240]   That's typically what I have done is I guess I go into that tab and pull it up that way
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.760]   But this was I like the idea of this is just a click or two, you know
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.320]   Yeah, and I think that's the that's the thought is yes
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.360]   You could go into history, but that requires you to kind of go into the menu dive into their search through a list
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:17.480]   This is like a very specific like share this over there. It's probably using the same exact syncing
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.200]   Functionality is just making it appear more intentionally. I like that idea. Yeah
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.520]   Not bad
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.720]   Also in mobile search a query of something like good shows to watch or what to watch
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.080]   Will now fire off. I couldn't get it to work for myself
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:39.320]   But supposedly it'll fire off a carousel for you to rate TVs and or tv and movie shows
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.440]   Movie shows tv shows and movies
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.280]   Sorry
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.400]   We we call them moving pictures back in my day
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.040]   movie shows and stories
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:58.440]   You could swipe left and right thumbs up thumbs down skip all in an effort to better identify through the search engine
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.640]   Uh what you like to get it for recommendations
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:07.400]   Supposedly you do a mobile search on your mobile device is something like good shows to watch or what to watch
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:13.000]   Those are the two examples that google put in their blog post, but when I did it, I didn't get the little carousel
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.160]   Um
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:20.760]   You could also search for genres. So like horror movies from the 1980s or adventure documentaries about
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   Climbing and it would know how to handle that as well as surfacing
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.160]   Where those
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.480]   Those the movie shows are available
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:34.200]   That was my next question is you giving me all these recommendations where will I be able to find them?
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.120]   Yeah, so it'll give you those results
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.080]   And then it'll also tie into I think your apps installed on your phone. So if you tap Netflix
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.560]   Oh, nice. I think it would take you through there. It's pretty slick. So it's interesting. I didn't get that
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.280]   But as I just looked what I got, you know, I got a bunch of movies with
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   Data on theaters and then I got a
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.320]   um
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.160]   Google thing that appeared people also searched for it has a netflix movies list
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.720]   Which is does not appear that netflix paid for
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:05.160]   And never let's movie movies list. So it's like all the movies on netflix. All right
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:12.600]   But netflix didn't did to have that out there. No, no, they just don't people were searching for it. That's right. Huh interesting
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.960]   Well, there was there was there was it was scraping scraping scraping speaking. Oh, sorry. You're the come back. I come back to it
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   Keep going. Okay. Okay
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.120]   Really change log. No, it's it's all good. We're almost there. There's really only one other thing
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:28.840]   It's really so short. Yeah, google express is about to be added to the google graveyard
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:34.200]   Apparently it closes in a few hardly new yee hardly new yee. We never used the
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.440]   I never really used google's press. I think I used it once
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:44.360]   Uh, google's redesigning its online shopping experience as such google is calling it an integration
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.560]   But let's face it express is just sunsetting
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.280]   It's going to be added to that graveyard that never ending uh page that
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.160]   Oh gosh that highlights all the things google has killed
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:01.560]   But at least this isn't something that was big the way those other things were you know, like google reader
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.120]   They wanted it they wanted it to be big
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:10.280]   This was yeah, nice try google google express had some deals. I remember I even saw some pretty decent deals on it
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.200]   They were really trying to like pull people in it was like but uh never never good enough to make me pull the trigger
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.880]   Right, so they have a deal with Costco. They I don't know about
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.760]   I know they did with walmart and best buy
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.080]   Um
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   Yeah, I don't know maybe with Costco as well
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.480]   That knows I try to do this locally or I try I talked to
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:39.160]   eBay and when they still loan pay pal many years ago when I was working with a newspaper company
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.000]   Trying to figure out how to do this because we figured that that you had delivery coming with
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.920]   um
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:53.480]   Uber and stuff and could could local advertisers compete with amazon by saying we got it. It's a mile away. We'll get it to you
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.480]   the problem that that that uh pay pal said and eBay said was
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.840]   Merchants just don't have their inventory digitized
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:05.080]   And it's not there and I wrote a business plan to do that
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.720]   But this is the structure is not there and people are so accustomed to using amazon
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:17.640]   I have a group of people we bring in the on on commerce in media at the new art school and um
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.600]   Uh one thing they've said when they could things like wire cutter and places like that
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:28.520]   When they put up commerce links on their sites the thing that drives conversion more than any else is
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.160]   available for prime
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.520]   Right, so people are just accustomed to amazon. Yep
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.000]   And happy with it. Absolutely
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.040]   Absolutely until the government protects them from it. Yes until
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.400]   Yeah, whatever's happening with the probe is over
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.360]   Until until amazon has been probed
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.160]   Um
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   I think that's it for the change lock
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:58.840]   Yeah, i'm sorry. I didn't mean to go there then I did
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.360]   Uh, okay, what were you gonna say jeff?
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.800]   Well while we're in the chain, but i'll use the right here. They're okay. I got a few to change
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.480]   Cool. Um what one is we should this is a follow up to the story we talked about in the show
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.680]   You guys weren't there. Uh, we heard two ago is the mit media lab
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:19.800]   Uh, and uh joey edo the director resigned this week after block buster reporting from ronin pharaoh
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.080]   You know, broder
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:27.160]   Ronin pharaoh is calling the answer is okay. I quit whatever it is. I quit now. Yeah, just it's not good when run in pharaohs
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.240]   Is not at all
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:29.720]   um
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:34.200]   Where uh, and it's unclear how high up and mit this reaches but jeff riaptis money
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.760]   Uh was taken and then hidden
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:43.400]   Uh in the media lab and um, you know, there are those out there who are now screaming kill the whole media lab
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.640]   Well, there's some good work going on good people are there they've announced a new governance structure
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:54.520]   patty mays who's a wonderful researcher professor there for many many many years is going to head a committee of five
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.680]   three women two men
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.920]   who will govern the media lab and
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.080]   uh, look for a director who bloody will better be a woman
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.000]   um
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.600]   And uh, so that's just kind of a follow up on that story where we were it but it's it was I was I was glued
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.680]   to twitter
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.520]   Um all weekend last weekend
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.480]   Uh as his story was rolling and rolling and rolling and rolling and there are people like jenny jardin
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.120]   of boi boy
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.240]   Has really been hard on the case here and bravely she's taken a lot of crap for it
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.240]   Uh, but the whole Epstein story including mit
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.560]   And where Epstein's influence and connections and god knows what else and money and god knows what else reached
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:43.960]   Uh, so she's been great on the story. Um, and uh, so I just wanted to mention that as a as a follow up
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:49.400]   I thought that was interesting. Do you think media labs still has a chance? There's just going to fold
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:54.120]   I think it's a lot of chance. There's a guy named deb roy runs a lab about about
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.640]   Civic conversations in a company called cortico out of there deb
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.520]   is x twitter, um
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:06.600]   I you know we've people I work with I'm working with him. Uh, so I know how smart he is
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:12.360]   Uh, uh, kate darlene does a lot of great stuff up there
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:18.280]   Uh, uh, with machines and you know, newless machines, but they also are in trouble for other things
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.480]   They had a supposed plant growing computer
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.240]   And the chronicle of higher education I think it was had a big story today
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.040]   Just saying that it was all hype that they were they were buying plants outside and putting it in the device and
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:35.400]   Wasn't really working so there was fraud there that kind of stuff. I think it almost do more damage in a way
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.560]   Right. You have companies paying a lot to be near this technology
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.800]   Now in truth
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.000]   Some my old employer used to pay them every year and I got up
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.400]   You know, I went up there a few times
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.680]   when we were supposed to be able to look at all this wonderful new technology and
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:57.160]   There were a few things there was, um, electronic ink came out of media lab that was worthwhile
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:01.800]   Um, but otherwise it was a fair big dose of bs
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.520]   Google glass
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.040]   Three out of
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.800]   Yeah, yeah
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.880]   That's that stoner. Well as I said a fair amount of bs. Yeah
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.440]   Ah
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440]   No, that stoner, um
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.760]   Almost got a p uh phd for his wearable
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.840]   They were they were debating whether they should give his
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:30.200]   wearable computer that he had gone through the media lab with a phd
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:35.800]   Because he had to wear it for his for his final, uh, uh oral
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   uh
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.640]   presentation
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:44.120]   And there were they were going back and forth over should he be allowed to use it
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:47.480]   Should he not be allowed to use it? Should it
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.280]   itself be given a phd
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:58.040]   So what happened? You know, I'm putting a link in the chapter. It didn't give it didn't get the phd. He did
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   Um, but it's a fascinating story. Hmm. Yeah, but I think I think they need just a major house clearing clean there
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.040]   They they need a major
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.600]   Regrouping on what value of the lab does have
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.400]   Uh, they need to do a lot of apologizing
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.200]   But that doesn't mean that you get there there are people there are some a thousand people even succorman said
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:25.320]   Who are involved with the lab as students or professors or projects and to just overnight say, uh, it's dirty
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.480]   That's kind of the moral pemic
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.120]   Of saying technology bad see I told you people were grabbing on anything like this
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:36.280]   This had very little dude technology it had to do with, uh,
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.520]   financial corruption
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.400]   Really?
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.280]   Um
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:43.720]   So anyway, so that's that's a follow-up that I think was worth mentioning
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.320]   Now, okay, so then I will tack on to that and say this news about bill gates
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.840]   Right, uh, he has a new three-part documentary. It's about to hit on netflix
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:23:01.000]   Uh, this is a really flimsy story. Yeah, like i'm curious about this one. I don't like you know
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.320]   Obviously there are a lot of people who are interrupted
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:03.960]   No, no
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.320]   I'm just gonna say there are a lot of people that are atoning to their relationship to jeffree Epstein in a number of different ways
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.680]   And now it's come out that gates, you know, he was on flight logs
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.520]   Uh, he also met with Epstein in 2013 has other ties like
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.160]   Do you do you think that any of that ire is going to strike bill gates as well?
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.960]   Of course, we don't know enough yet
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   Uh in the ronin pharaoh story
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:31.640]   Uh, Epstein was taking credit for directing bill gates to give money the media lab
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:36.040]   As a lot of people pointed out it's real hard to envision anybody directing bill gates to do anything
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.040]   Yeah, that's true the good, um
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.160]   So we haven't really heard enough yet. We need to hear more from gates
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:48.600]   It is on interest, but I have my doubts that Epstein had any, um, puppet strings over bill gates
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.240]   It's just type of proxy always in place
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:56.280]   regarding any type of transactions or discussions between Epstein and gates
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.560]   By proxy, I mean
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.000]   A middleman a middle person that you know, they wouldn't oh, I don't know
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.080]   I don't know that's a good question seems like I read something along those lines of yeah
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:14.360]   They they knew each other new of each other or what have you but any communication or transactions usually has some type of middleman
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.520]   If you want to take credit for the first thing directly with right
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:24.840]   Yeah, so there could be something there, but it's far too soon to condemn bill gates and anything that he's involved in
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:32.280]   As a result investigation will show if ronin pharaoh starts calling i'm i'd run for the hills, but right but so far we don't have that
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.360]   Yeah, yeah
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.640]   Fair enough. So that's an interesting story another interesting story that I just added that I forgot about
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:45.080]   Um is there was a big court decision this week on scraping
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.360]   Oh, okay. Yes, um, it's great. Hi q
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.680]   Uh had gone after linkedin
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.320]   Hi q was building a business upon scraping data out of linkedin and linkedin
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.880]   At some point gave a cease and desist and under the computer fraud act
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.560]   Linked in thought that was enough to make them stop, but they went ahead and took them to court
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.040]   And high q1
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.600]   And what the court said I ever read the whole decision, but what I read a lot of smart people about it
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.040]   And and among the things that the court said was that
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.080]   um
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:24.040]   Linked in's data is presented publicly public knowledge and for linkedin to then say no no no no no no no no
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.360]   You can't see that
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.720]   um
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.920]   Is
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.280]   inconsistent and wrong and is going to be harmful to
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.760]   um
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.840]   Knowledge and that notion alone I celebrate
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:45.800]   Um, and I think this notion of of being in public and be other people to being able to build on the knowledge they get from that
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:52.840]   Is what's going to build our future world? So it was a it was a fascinating discussion eff is celebrating
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.040]   Um, a lot of people I know aren't quite sure what to think
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.720]   but
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.520]   um
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.800]   And haven't really figured it all out yet as as as kclonic who's a
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.120]   Maybe daphne keller daphne keller is brilliant
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.760]   Stanford
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.880]   uh law professor said that now these
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.240]   These these what used to be separate domains of law
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.960]   That you know, you were special is that now we're all mushing together in one decision
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.560]   And it's really hard to figure out, but this is going to turn out to be an important decision because what it means is that
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.560]   um
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.560]   Trying to restrict
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.960]   information
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.160]   Will work
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.600]   That's the essence of of of of fights about copyright and stuff copyright only protects the treatment of the information
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.440]   Not the underlying information itself
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   And if this information is made public
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.280]   Then you can go in and you can get it and you can draw on it and you can do things with it
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.480]   And that's going to lead to growth and that's going to lead to good things. I think
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.680]   So this is a big one. I don't understand how the linked in council would would say
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.680]   um
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:00.280]   Potential fraud abuse see, you know, it's public information. What were they're going on?
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.760]   They're saying that that that you
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.440]   Um, I I get I have a rather decision to answer. I'll get this messed up
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.320]   But I think it was
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.680]   Um, almost like a terms of service that you you came in as a user, you know to find a job
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.680]   But instead you made a company
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:20.120]   And under cffa under the other computer fraud act
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.480]   Um, if you gave someone a cease and desist
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.520]   Uh, that was sufficient notice to make them stop doing something
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.760]   And you had the right to do that and now the court say no that that doesn't hold
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.800]   Because this public data
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   Yeah
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.120]   Uh, and a lot of people mentioned this in
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.640]   Light of
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:49.560]   Senior mode jonathan shorts, right the the the young brilliant man who killed himself
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.360]   Yes, and the jay store account Jonathan. Thank you
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.080]   um
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.600]   And that
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:02.440]   They wonder whether this would have had an impact on that because what he did was use mit computers to scrape
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.360]   Every article off of jay store the um
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.440]   academic repository of of of of papers
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:15.720]   And uh that that scraping then would have been okay now jay stores behind a paywall
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:22.440]   Uh, and I suspect it wouldn't have worked because that was a a contractual obligation
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.800]   I don't want to get too legal because they i'm i'm not qualified to do so
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:32.200]   But this got this got a lot this this decision got a lot of buzz in geek legal circles
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.280]   Interesting stuff, um
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.960]   Let's see here. I'm realizing we need to take a break
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.520]   Uh, we might have a few more things to talk about after the break and then we get to our tips trip
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.080]   Uh tips tricks numbers things
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.720]   Whatever we happen to bring to the table first
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.040]   Let's take a break and thanks sponsor this episode of this week in google's brought to you by express vpn
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:00.040]   Uh, if you think that your data is not valuable enough to be snooped on you are wrong
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.840]   Uh, maybe you think nobody cares about your online data. You are wrong. Nobody
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.440]   Uh
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.240]   Nobody has data that is valuable to somebody. Let's just say that
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.720]   Uh, because you listen to this show you understand that your privacy is under attack
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:19.000]   Uh in a number of different ways hackers governments isp's they're all gobbling up your data
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.400]   That's why we recommend getting the software
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.640]   Uh, that we trust to protect our online identity. I know I do it's express vpn
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:29.400]   Their apps use powerful encryption to secure your data
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.760]   Express vpn runs in the background of your computer your phone
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:39.880]   Uh, and you use the internet just as you normally do all you have to really do is just download the app click to connect and you're protected
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:45.480]   Uh, and you know, if you're going to public Wi-Fi or wherever you happen to be really at any time
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.720]   Use express vpn
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.760]   Uh, it's going to protect you no matter where you are. You know, even if you're at home
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.840]   You don't trust your ISP cool. You could set it up so that it's just running all the time
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.760]   And then you don't have to worry about it express vpn is the fastest vpn that i've tried to cost less than seven dollars per month
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.400]   Comes with a 30 day money back guarantee express vpn uses new cutting edge
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:12.440]   Server technology called trusted server that actually prevents the operating system and apps from ever writing to the hard drive
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:18.440]   As you can see this is a whole new standard of privacy and security a whole other level of it
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.160]   It's time to stop hackers big brother and internet companies from grabbing all your data take back your online privacy
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:31.480]   Like i did with express vpn. I do love express vpn. I've used i've used a number of vpn services
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.840]   Over the years express vpn is probably the easiest
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:40.840]   Vpn that i've seen because you literally you just press that button and boom you're on and things don't slow down and
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.760]   That's another big issue that i've run into with vpn things just seem like they're creeping along
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.320]   I don't feel that with express vpn. It's basically it's the same experience
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:56.440]   Uh just protect it. That's what it's all about protect your online activity today and find out how you can get three extra months free with a one-year package
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:05.720]   And express vpn.com/twig that's e xpr es s vpn.com/twig for three extra months free with a one-year package
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:12.920]   One more time express vpn.com/twig to learn more and before we jump back in i also realized
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:17.160]   Uh that we do this now a little bit of information on triangulation
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:23.080]   If you missed triangulation recently, you definitely want to check it out mica sergeant just last friday interviewed david
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:29.400]   Weinberger author of everyday chaos technology complexity and how we're thriving in a new world of possibility
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.880]   They actually talked about artificial intelligence big data modern science
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:43.320]   Uh how they're all revealing one fundamental truth. That's what the world is way more complex and unpredictable than we've allowed ourselves to see
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.080]   uh all that and even the magic of
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:53.960]   chicken sexting yes chicken sexting is indeed in there. Yes. I I um I interviewed so I read the book
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.600]   It's wonderful. David's a dear friend. He's brilliant
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.320]   Um, the book is great and uh, I talked about on the show before
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.520]   Uh, and I also interviewed david at a bookstore in new york where he didn't fact talk about chicken sexting
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:11.960]   Um, I'll let that I'll let that mystery stay so you can watch the show but but david talks about how
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.640]   um
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.840]   Machine learning artificial intelligence, but even just ab testing
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:21.000]   Takes away our sense of control
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.680]   And predictability that is to say we think we know how people are going to operate but the data says something else
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.720]   The data doesn't come with an explanation. There is no explanation
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.480]   That's just what happens and the data reliably predict that well, sorry
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.560]   I can't explain this behavior to you
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:40.600]   But we are addicted to the notion that we can't explain right we can tell a story that's going to explain all this and that
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:47.320]   Takes the rug off from underneath us and it's very unsettling. So david's a very calming influences of philosopher
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:53.800]   uh wonderfully sweet nice guy um brilliant and but also gives you kind of um
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:33:01.080]   Uh in the one hand frightening things with the other hands has relaxed about this. This is the reality where we're going and and it's probably okay
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:05.960]   So I would recommend even though I haven't seen it yet. I look forward to watching
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:11.000]   Yes, but david is somebody I recommend highly. Yeah pay attention to and uh,
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.760]   I mean chicken sexting that's all we got to say
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:19.880]   More and right there right there in the headquarters of chicken sexting. Yeah, that'll luma california. That's right. See it's it's totally on brand
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:25.320]   Uh, that was last week's uh last friday's episode. You can find it at twitter.tv/tri
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:31.160]   Uh or triangulation is found this friday leo's actually going to talk with jonobake and about
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:36.760]   Uh his new book people powered how communities can supercharge your business brand and teams
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:43.400]   Uh and you can check that out this friday that'll hit the feeds twit.tv/tri for triangulation
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.440]   Uh awesome show. I love when I get the opportunity to do triangulation
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.760]   I'm sir at some point and you'll do an episode of triangulation. It's just a cool opportunity
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.720]   Like sit down with really smart people and talk about the thing that they are just
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:02.040]   Dialed into it's been it's been great watching those conversations and i've watched that episode last week
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.600]   It was really really good like a right home
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.240]   Um any last bits and pieces before we get into the numbers
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:09.800]   Oh
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.600]   Samsung's galaxy fold is is now apparently available in south south korea
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:18.040]   It's going to come to the us probably by the end of the month forget about by that pixel four
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.640]   I know you're gonna buy the fool for what?
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.640]   $1,000 you're all about the fold right?
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.200]   No
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.760]   Come on someone here has to be all about the fold. Oh no, I don't I don't get it
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.680]   I guess i'm not productive enough to think that multiple screens on a
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   Mobile device like that is useful
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.520]   Um, sorry, I mean, I yes when i'm at the workstation
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.120]   I have either a really large screen or multiple monitors
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.400]   But something about it on the mobile device just doesn't
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:48.920]   Screen productivity to me. I understand
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:54.680]   I'm i'm interested in it from a curiosity standpoint. I'm not interested in it from a
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:59.880]   I've got to have that because if I do it's going to open up all these worlds that I never knew before
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.160]   So you're interested just enough to go see it in the store
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.960]   Yeah, or get a review you
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:13.960]   I'm interested enough to live with it for a couple of weeks and then be like, uh, but this is what I really want
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:20.920]   But who knows maybe I would get it really this is awesome. Yeah, isn't it? It looks like it probably is
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.160]   Um, some people talk about it. I get to see a person
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:28.920]   They talk about it being a tablet to send your pocket and yeah, I guess that's that's great and innovative
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.880]   But again, I just don't see the extra use for it
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.040]   And then and I'm sure it's not going to have the horsepower to be productive
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.720]   You know, yeah, I mean it's it's running a pretty top of the line
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:46.680]   You know a 55. Oh, it's got a 12 gigs of ram. I believe like they've they've put some nice
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:52.120]   Nice power into it. Okay. Um, I stand corrected and it's almost $2,000 new
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:58.280]   That might be the deciding factor to grand this right here msi workstation
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:05.320]   Yeah, quadro rtx gpu from in vidia, you know, that's same. Yes
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.760]   For this take your pick
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:14.680]   Uh and any one last thing for me. Yeah, go for it as I mentioned before we came in the air
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:20.040]   I'm fascinated by this so the protesters in hong kong were really truly a movement
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.200]   um zade up defecc pointed out that they have
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:28.840]   A new national anthem for hong kongs, you know, screw you china
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:34.440]   What they're saying and it was written by one person, but then he put the music up put the first
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.880]   uh, verse of lyrics up online then they collaboratively did
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.600]   uh the next
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.320]   uh
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.440]   verses
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.640]   and then
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:51.560]   Uh are now recorded they're singing at thousands of people in moles on multiple levels are singing this
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:58.360]   Uh, there's now an arc and orchestral version, which is on the rundown, uh, which is really good
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:04.200]   Um, it's just fascinating to see now god help us we could find ourselves in another Arab spring where
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.040]   Oppression comes afterwards, but this is pretty amazing
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:11.960]   A lot of people said to me over the years. Oh, the chinese people don't want this kind of freedom
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.880]   They're having a great time now. They're done. No, no, no, no, no, I say can you how could you possibly say that you can't listen to them?
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.880]   You don't know you can't hear
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.440]   But hong kong they can still they can speak and this is how they're speaking and other singing
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:31.720]   Wow like a crowdsource national anthem
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.440]   Yes, we're with a con, you know what i mean?
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.240]   That's unbelievable
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.240]   numbers you're talking about
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.520]   And then yeah, we were talking about this a little bit prior to the show
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.520]   I was telling you guys that we have an interview tomorrow on on uh tech news weekly
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.840]   with a gentleman i'm pulling up the the doc so i can get his name john coit's here
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.960]   Uh who wrote an article for forbs about how
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.960]   Uh protesters in hong kong, you know, they're being cut off from the internet
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:05.160]   Uh, so communication between them was next to impossible, but now they're using an app that uh that
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:13.080]   Allows for communication over bluetooth so that they basically bypass the internet entirely and they get it's like basically like this big distributed messaging
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.400]   mesh network
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.000]   uh, it's just
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.800]   like the the the lengths that they're going to
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.840]   to
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.160]   Get their message and be able to communicate have a voice. It's yeah, it's really crazy
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.800]   pretty inspiring, but
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:30.760]   Anyways, that's that's really neat. Jeff. I have not heard that
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.840]   Uh nice song too. Is that a nice? Yeah, it actually it's a good
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.480]   Yeah, absolutely stirrings the right word for it
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:43.240]   Cool. All right. Well, um, I think we've touched on most of the things. Why don't we get into
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:47.000]   The numbers and stuff. We'll start with you. Jeff. What's your what's your number of the week?
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.720]   Oh, let's see here. Um
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:57.640]   I think i'll go with the the use by seniors of facebook has doubled since 2012
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:04.600]   Now you we could we could pitch that story two ways one is don't worry about facebook the kids are okay
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:11.640]   Uh, it's going to the grandpa's the other one you could argue is grandpa's going crazy and part of the reason is facebook
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.520]   Right, right, right, right. Um because fake news is being spread by old people who look like me
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.240]   Uh, not young people. Let us say old waitmen
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.600]   For those of you on audio as if you didn't know
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.760]   um
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.760]   uh, so, uh
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.480]   Yeah, facebook is becoming more and more and more the place of uh of old folks and and
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:38.680]   That's probably more worrisome for the future of facebook than anything which I found interesting. Hmm. That is that's fascinating
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.600]   um
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.600]   kind of not surprising there
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:47.480]   The other thing I had to put it there was kind of a uh, changed along thing was even too small
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:54.120]   For a boring change along but i'll mention it really quickly is that google has a new feature that lets you display your word count
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.400]   As you go oh and docs or in drive
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:02.680]   Yeah, which I kind of hate I kind of because it's I can imagine students saying they said 2000 words. Okay
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:06.600]   They're wrote 1900
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:13.480]   110 no, I gotta put it some more words. Does it do character counts? I would love that. I bet it does
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.640]   Yeah, that's kind of a cool tool. I could see though
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:24.120]   Getting too obsessive about it like there's something about writing something and then having to go up to analyze what you just wrote
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.480]   Instead of like real time read out of like I just need three more words
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:31.560]   Done. We were talking on the show. Uh, don't worry. I will do this again
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:36.760]   Those of you who are listening but I did a whole thing about we did a whole long grandpa thing about word processing
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.640]   in the early days after the day when I had this drive
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.040]   Which is big
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.720]   But one of the things you had to do is when you wanted to to spell check
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.200]   It was a batch thing right you had to write right right right and then you hit a button
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.720]   To spell check and i'm gonna go through and mark all the words and you go through a list
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.080]   Separately and you have to change the words on the list to change to the text back in my day
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.960]   Yes, so some people were complaining about having to go in and kind of batch word count
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.960]   This is by going up to a specific feature to kind of run it
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.080]   And the old jargon and now they take another way just just there. Yeah, so 10 years from now
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.440]   Uh, this this will just be we'll be so used to seeing our are always on word count
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.680]   That thinking about having to batch word count is going to seem so quaint
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:25.400]   Yes
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400]   Actually you won't have it
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:32.840]   You won't have words anymore. You'll just have a meme count. We're gonna we're gonna write an emoji in memes
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.920]   That's right language is shifting
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.560]   And what you got?
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:48.120]   I didn't have anything initially, but uh, you were after all asked to do this show like right before we went on air, you know, that's okay
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.600]   That's all good. No, um, but I wanted to uh bring up a project that I did
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.480]   A month or so ago
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.720]   In recognition for yesterday
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:04.520]   I know today is september 11th, but yesterday september 10th is worldwide, um suicide awareness day
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.800]   And we I think we need to continue
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.480]   to have conversations about mental health
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:12.760]   and
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:19.960]   Defects of it and that project that I worked on is with a friend of mine that wanted to help get the message out about
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:25.320]   Mental health awareness and he allowed me to just sit down with him and we just
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.360]   talked he suffers from ptsd
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.400]   He is a us army vet
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:37.240]   Served six years had some great stories and he just tells it like it is far as
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.400]   dealing with mental health issues and
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:48.280]   The fact that no one is really talking about it, especially in the black community and how it's been so in black bald and
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.800]   Did it in three part videos and um
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:01.400]   I'm so so grateful that you do this hand. Yeah, I think it's so important, you know and and that your openness and
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:07.880]   Bringing in other people into it. It's so important and I'm so glad you do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for mentioning
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:13.320]   I will watch this with great interest. Absolutely. Um, yeah that that that hits home for me
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:19.080]   My dad is is a vieton veteran and uh, you know has suffered all his life with ptsd. So
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:23.160]   Um, is not something to just oh, I didn't know that drug
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.800]   Yeah, you know, yeah, absolutely
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.080]   Um, yeah
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.400]   This is so important because because this kind of general this is what I mean with sharing his generosity
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:36.280]   Right, so and has talked about the show before about his family and this you just mentioned this Jason
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:39.160]   I've got people in my family as well
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:43.320]   And and that's what makes it okay for other people to stand up and say
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.760]   Me too or to say somebody I know has this somebody I have somebody to talk to
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:51.560]   it's so critically
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:57.800]   So important and so generous to do so i'm grateful. Yeah, vulnerability gets vulnerability, right?
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.160]   It is yep
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.600]   Opening the doors for vulnerability and I I feel like honestly this is this is a lesson that I've only learned in the past year
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.800]   To great length and work that i've done in my own personal life
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:14.040]   But vulnerability when you open yourself up to that man, it's like it's like the world opens up because suddenly you give everybody else
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.160]   The permission to explore it with you and read them with you
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.800]   Chills right now. Thank you so much for mentioning that super important stuff and uh
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.920]   I definitely will watch that. Um, I'm very interested
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.840]   um mine pales in comparison to be honest coming
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.760]   Coming into this episode
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:36.520]   I really had no tip or trick or anything and then finally it hit me like it doesn't have to be anything groundbreaking
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.920]   Gmail has dark mode. There you go. Oh
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.720]   No
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.920]   Dark mode is finally really good. Yes. Give me dark mode
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.800]   There are people that love dark mode. Okay, jaff you're not a fan
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:58.120]   I hate it hate it really can I increase me? I know it's irrational, but it creeps me out
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:05.400]   Really? Oh, man. I just find it's like it's like it's like it's like it's so quieting for me like it's all you would
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.360]   I just
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.720]   Carsten it matches your dark soul
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.280]   Absolutely
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:20.040]   Oh boy, uh, so yes update to the new gmail for android
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:25.080]   And you'll probably see a little mood in there that you can switch to to turn everything dark. That is a win
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.960]   There you go. That's that's as much of a tip as it needs to be
