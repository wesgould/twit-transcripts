[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.240]   Hello there from
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120]   from Yorkshire
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.280]   North Yorkshire North North Yorkshire that's really nice
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.440]   well, I
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.560]   Was so I went to the coffee shop in Stokely today. I just put the picture in the
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.080]   The chat the chat and I went to the bathroom and on the wall was this this part of the wallpaper was this image
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.640]   So I think it's actually co versus Fife
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.880]   If you look at the link I just put in you'll see what I mean, I'm looking I'm looking for the link
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   I'm not sure where you put it, but I'm looking in the chat room. Sorry. Oh in the chair room. Wow, you're the most sophisticated
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.600]   guest
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.720]   I'm here. I'm like oh, oh good. So this is
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.780]   This is the rum a coffee shop the coffee shop
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.400]   And I was the bathroom was like wait what so I think I think this is the hidden message or else
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.040]   I should check the rest of the wallpaper there and see what should have added some graffiti so round about one in the morning
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.960]   Washington time
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.960]   the president tweeted I
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.080]   Don't the tweets gone. It's been removed. What did he say?
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.840]   Jeff Jeff read it to us. Yeah, I don't have it Hindi. Okay
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.960]   It was in the New York Times to the story on it. I was
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.240]   Despite the constant negative
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.200]   It's actually quite beautifully crafted despite the constant negative press
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.600]   called Fifi
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.080]   And then somebody named coffee the strong says I have been summoned
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.600]   And then the wizard coffee he says no you fool it is I who have been summoned by the great
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.240]   And on and on
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.640]   Urban dictionary last I checked this morning down 16 pages of definitions my favorite one was this
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.240]   Kofeffi a word used to end a tweet that should never have been started
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.520]   So and and by the way a lot of
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   Nesco Kofe
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.840]   There
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.880]   Just having some fun with this because people people
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.400]   Who among us has not type owed a tweet or two or did you hear did you hear what?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.780]   What spicy said well before we do that the president himself responded
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.720]   Saying who can figure out the meaning of Kofeffi enjoy
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.840]   So that was a 3.09 a.m. So
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.360]   Anyway, what did what did spicy say so spicy said oh hell looking for it
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.400]   There when asked you know should we be concerned about Trump having these nonsensical tweets and who else is accidentally said
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.200]   Spicy said with a straight face there is a small group of people who know exactly what he means. Oh, please
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.240]   Sean
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.960]   Please come on. It's just it's I
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.400]   Actually to be honest my fear was he had a stroke because that's it's like you know the murderer is
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:14.840]   But it's you know he was in the middle of something got distracted or whatever and I don't know what happened but
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.280]   Who has never fat fingered the keyboard everybody's done this so only not gonna oh
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.840]   It's it is kind of a great hanging tweet despite the constant negative press
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.000]   Ko-fi-fi
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.120]   That gave it some a little bit more resonance by the way Ko-fi-fi the strong also
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   Responded to the wizard stand down wizard the always mind for the taking be off with you so that I might ask the all master
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.120]   What he requires of me?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.400]   Tippleton the orb of to Keth is not some play joy you would be wise to rethink your course
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.560]   So this is really what Twitter was made for if in fact I think stupid jokes
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.800]   I think this is peak Twitter. We are at peak Twitter. It does not get better than this the
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.240]   President of the freakin United States the most powerful man the leader of the free world and
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.880]   a midnight tweet
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   Ko-fi-fi and then he summons Ko-fi-fi the strong the wizard Ko-fi-fi and they get in a battle
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   And that's just oh my god
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.640]   Here's what Clinton I'm pretty so what Hillary say about it. So I just put it in the in the other shack
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   She must have been laughing. I mean, it's just you know, it's not you can't get serious about this. I
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.000]   Mean, it's just you know, it's just funny. All right. Here's here's from
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.040]   here's here's a
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.600]   Let me paste this in this is from the hill
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.800]   Clinton did she tweet?
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.320]   No, I think it was at Rico at the co-conference here. We go. Let's see which we have to get to questions from the audience
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.720]   But and I don't think we can get into confit fee right now because it's a longer thing
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.680]   Cara swisher and while Mossberg talking to a
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.540]   Secretary of State former secretary of state Hillary. I thought I thought it was a hidden message to the Russians
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:07.880]   Thank you so much for that. That's a good get boy to get
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.320]   Oh, that was good. Yeah, Hillary Clinton is somebody complaining to me on on
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.320]   Twitter that this was just awful because it was a private conference, but they've been streamed it to the world
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.440]   It was great God bless cara. I would that be awful. I don't understand. I
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.960]   You know what at this point
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.760]   Miss Clinton is a private citizen. She's not she's not bound to do anything
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.440]   Except perhaps not pose with a chopped off head of Donald Trump, but other than that I
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.240]   Have not seen the picture, but I don't think I want to see the picture so
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   Kofi Vee
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Or Fefe or coffee coffee
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.160]   Kave this is that this is the next gift versus Jeff
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.680]   It's so funny. It's no no this is
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.320]   In three weeks. We're gonna pull this out of the remembrance hat. Oh remember be like what was
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:06.760]   Faithy although be so much between here and there. You're absolutely right Stacy. Oh, I dread to think what the next three weeks hold
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.240]   What was it Betty Davis said you're in for a bumpy ride holds faster than your seat belts were in for a bumpy ride
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.480]   I feel sad about this. I was you know, I'm leaving on vacation
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.360]   In a few days. This will be my last twig for a couple of weeks
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.520]   And I'm I'm getting ready as I often do this is gonna be a very you know photo
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.200]   It's gonna be a photo expedition for at least send me we're both bringing our fancy cameras and all that and I
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.080]   So I put the software on and I went to the Nick collection because I love the Nick plugins
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.520]   For Lightroom and lo and behold on the site and actually I saw this and I didn't realize it was newsworthy
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.200]   But somebody's picked it up a couple of days later the Nick collection
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.840]   free and compatible with
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.560]   Mac OS 10.7 through 10 10 windows Vista 7 and 8 does work with Windows 10 and
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.440]   Adobe Photoshop through CC 2015
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.240]   We have no plans to update the collection or add new features over time. It's the death now
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.160]   This is a company Google bought a few years ago
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:16.960]   They bought them for snap seat, which was the app which Google does keep up to date and offers on Android and iOS
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.360]   It's an excellent photo editing app, but pros really liked in the collection Lisa uses
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.580]   There's silver effects which and many pros use it as the best black and white photography
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.440]   Filter, but they had a lot of other great treats. So it's a little sad
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.600]   But the Nick collection it has been free
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.560]   It's in school. Go bought it. They turned that it was 150 bucks and I bought it
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.080]   shortly before Google gave it a start giving it away in fact
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.640]   but it is free, but it
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:53.600]   Who knows how long it will continue to work so that's kind of sad Lisa was complaining actually that silver effects was not working reliably on the Mac
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.320]   So I'm dying to know
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.240]   Have you ordered an essential of course well I put my name in yeah, no
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.080]   In fact, I I was on a little bit of a buying spree
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.920]   Oh, Andy Rubens essential, which is of course Andy Ruben was at
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:21.160]   Danger rights he created this helped create the sidekick. He was an apple before that. Yep went to danger with Bill Atkinson
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.960]   Then went on to create on his own with you know a company called Android which Google bought
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.560]   Became the basis for the Android operating system worked there for a long time
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.360]   You remember remember a couple of years ago
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.400]   We talked about the fact that he was leaving the Android division to do a moonshot with robots because he's the guys really into robots
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   His house his whole house is robotified
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.440]   Left Google to start this
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.040]   This secret startup which now has kind of gone public
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:58.400]   It's an Android phone called the essential and more than that I'm Stacy. I'm actually very interested what you think of it a
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.520]   home
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.640]   Automation unit with an open source operating system not like me another one of these
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.800]   It's pretty it has a screen
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.520]   It it's
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.120]   Apparently less dependent on the cloud whatever that means
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   It's not everything
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:29.080]   Locally that it can and then there's some privacy functions. Yeah probably a response to you know people's concerns about Google Home and Amazon's Echo
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.760]   It's echo like although it also is for home automation, right?
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.360]   Or what do you know about it because there's not a lot to say this is this is all we all we see
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.440]   So I've seen I've looked at the website. I watched part of his code most of his code thing and then I got called away
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.440]   I'm not super thrilled about this. So this is gonna come out. There's no pricing on the home thing yet
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:58.400]   It's gonna come out in June into June. I believe is what they said. So we'll know more than I
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.160]   Feel like the phone
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:09.720]   The phone feels very fetishistic to me in a way that I don't care about because I'm actually not a gadget lover
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.400]   Like so when he's talking about the titanium and the 360
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.120]   Coverage the only thing that I was excited about was like oh stock Android
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.400]   But this is this is just me. I know there's lots of people who looked at this and was like whoo
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.840]   So I'm really interested in how it's gonna interact with the home
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:34.520]   Because what this says is he feels like you have to have a phone to work with a home and they apparently need to work together I
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.560]   Wish that weren't true. I think he's not he's right
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.640]   But and I tweeted a little bit about this
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   The focus on the gadgets
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.600]   feels
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.480]   Aging to me. It's an aging idea. I want to focus on construct
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.880]   Sorry construct context
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:02.280]   Hardware someone yeah, and I feel like there's a chance that it may do this
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.440]   But we just haven't seen enough in the context stuff is easy to say whoo
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.960]   But it's really hard to deliver and he's got a plus on the openness. He's really hitting on openness which Kevin
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   I can't wait to hear your thoughts there
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.600]   So yeah, the home is based on something called ambient OS
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   Which he says is gonna be completely open
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.000]   Yes, and I signed up to get all the information and the SDK on that so we'll see but
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   Non-trivial thing to do. I mean he hasn't been working on this that long. I don't I'm curious what he's I
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   Just I don't know
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.600]   You know, you know, I think you just hit the nail on the head when you said fetishistic there is a certain
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.160]   Fetishism having to do with these gadgets these phones
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   There are objects, you know, they're my precious
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.920]   And I kind of agree with you and boy, but at the same time, you know
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.120]   I
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.120]   Went kicking and screaming to cover these things. I don't want to cover these things
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.240]   But they have become the the computer that everybody uses more than anything else
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:12.560]   So we kind of have to cover it. This is where oh, yeah, I'm not saying you it's not worth coverage. I just think I
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.200]   Want this to fade into the background? I feel like in 50 years
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.520]   We're gonna look back at people clutching their phones and talking about them as like nuts. Huh?
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:29.960]   That's weird. Well, that's what Mossberg said in his final column this week. He said this is the future of computing is disappear is
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   That they will disappear
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.160]   They will become part of the environment
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   Well, it's a smart dude. Yeah
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.040]   Well, it's actually it's pretty obvious. This is this is where we've going for a long time
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   And the computer is moving from this big centralized
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:53.520]   Object to decentralized and eventually in fabric every of our lives and machine learning will then as
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:01.840]   Part of that is a thin layer of peanut butter on top of the be part of our lives and that's why voice interfaces and things like this
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.880]   This home device
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.600]   Are kind of I think gonna be important because this is how we're gonna. This is this will be the computer interface
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.440]   Yeah, well and we'll interact with voice will interact with photos and images will interact with
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.040]   Other means I like that. You know what if what if the cloud we're not called the cloud or we're called peanut butter
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.800]   I like that. It's everywhere. You can't get rid of it
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.080]   It's so Kevin do you think this is oh, sorry, no, please go ahead
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.040]   I'm really curious on the openness in obviously we don't know a lot yet, but thoughts there
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:44.200]   Well, he's he's demonstrated a belief in openness before he's done a good job with that with with Android
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.960]   So he's got a track record to build on so I'm giving the benefit of the down to we see the details so
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:57.080]   We do need you know Android has settled down as this as the most successful as we've had ever
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.120]   And it has an open source base so you know more power to to rubin for starting that and continue it
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:11.720]   I'm interested in the Internet of Things focus and and and if he's if he's actually trying to bite off the can we write
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.240]   I know it's for all of those things that that that that is sort of hinted at here in this ambient OS stuff
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:23.440]   But that's that's even there's even less, you know information about that now. So again very much wait and see
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.720]   Yeah
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:35.440]   Maybe tied to the success of Android is also the in many ways the scariest least secure operating system
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.520]   Ever I know many people who will be secure ever well, no, you're right
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:48.640]   There've been many many many more less insecure however given it does have reasonable sandboxing, you know, yeah, but
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.320]   Again and again we hear about now. There's a you know, we talked about yesterday security now a fairly significant
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.840]   flaw that allows remote root exploits of Android devices and in that which Google doesn't plan to fix and
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.200]   So this is more and more of a problem
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.360]   And I know many people refuse to touch Android because they say it's just not secure
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.280]   I mean they say I'm gonna use an iPhone instead. I don't know if that's really a good alternative, but
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.600]   But that's the only alternative. Yeah, what else you can you can use a
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.760]   Candy bar phone from Nokia, I guess
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.520]   So I think it's no more the sweet split there's any more that's yeah
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.400]   But that right because nobody's gonna bother to exploit that but I think that that's kind of an issue is
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.920]   And I don't think openness solves this or contributes to it. I want to be clear about that sometimes people say oh, yeah
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   That's because it's open. That's not the issue
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.760]   But it is a problem and I you know, I don't well you could celebrate the success of Android
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.080]   I think you probably should also point to the fact that it's got some really intractable security problems
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.440]   Now that's I mean that's fair but
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:08.200]   You know, it's you know, we've seen a lot of a lot of security issues over the last since I was lost on we've had we had the whole
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.520]   Okay, what it was called now, but but the whole
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:18.320]   Lock lock down the computers that was based on Windows SMB support that was left in there for
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   Several yeah Windows - yeah
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.160]   And that's you know, there's this this this and
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:32.120]   There's always me about some ways it's very hard to complete secure something and the bigger the target the more time people spend on it
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:40.200]   Well, that's the thing this is a big target as you can get and the one of the stories this week Judy a new malware and Android may have infected 36
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.440]   Million Android phones
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.840]   Partly because it's it's on 41 apps that were on the Google Play Store. They're now gone
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.620]   It Google Play Store's screening is not very good
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.080]   It's gotten a lot better. Yeah
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.280]   Well, I think there's some people might disagree with you for instance
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.620]   I mean, what was the name of the malware? We were talking about on security now yesterday
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:14.360]   This is a terrible cautionary tale the the bug was revealed to Google
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.720]   Six months a year ago. They did nothing about in fact. They marked it won't fix
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.160]   So the company that discovered the bug
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.240]   Has publicized it
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.600]   They even did a proof of concept where they made an app that took advantage of it
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.520]   It's called the content jacking flaw
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.440]   they made an app that would take advantage of it and
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:43.160]   submitted it to the Android store was approved in half a day and it's still there and
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.000]   The problem with this content jacking is it's a it's a very
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.080]   It's a simple flaw and I think the reason Google won't fix it is because it's used it takes advantage of accessibility features
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.520]   There's two there's two permissions that it
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:05.280]   It takes advantage of one is the ability to one application to draw over another application and that allows
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.320]   malicious application to to present a different look
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.400]   Something like you're logging into your Google or or whatever
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:21.080]   Very difficult to mitigate this and Google doesn't apparently seem to want to fix it
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.600]   This and this is just the latest in the long line of these
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.960]   And the Google and the Google screening process did not catch it
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:35.800]   It's they say 60 percent of Android users almost a billion Android phones
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.280]   are affected by this and
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.360]   And Google just you know
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:51.120]   So I just I you know that's I only bring that up because I you know I don't blame Andy Rubin for that
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   No
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.360]   but
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.080]   If you could talk about the success of Android you have to mention this as well and
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.720]   Iot as you know is a big issue the security is a big issue
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.920]   Yeah, well, okay
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.280]   It's a different it is but there's
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.920]   Securing a connected Iot device is
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:24.760]   Kind of a different kettle of fish and thinking about the operating system will solve some of the issues
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.000]   But it's not going to solve
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.800]   all of them so I feel like
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.360]   What we've done in smartphones isn't going to work with Iot
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.280]   What we've done in smartphones hasn't worked entirely well with smartphones
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.520]   But I think the stakes are a lot higher and the surface area is so much greater when we get to Iot
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.120]   So it really matters and since everything historically has been so bad
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.000]   We're gonna have a lot of problems until it gets better. Great
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.400]   That's my optimistic thing someone in the chat room did point out from the verge of the verge story where
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.600]   Andy Rubin did say that
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.920]   Ambien OS was gonna be open source and he apparently has some magic way of updating it more often
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.400]   Yeah, he even kind of contests that there are issues with
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:23.040]   With Android and he kind of in his talk at Cody said well, you know people overstate the problem with Android
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:29.960]   F I'm not sure I agree with him on that well, he you know, he says
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.920]   He says nobody okay Walt Mossberg
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.040]   pointed out that Android
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.840]   is fragmented and splintered and and
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.240]   People aren't getting the updates
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.280]   Mossberg said the Google's OS has forked into wildly divergent versions around the world
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.400]   But Rubin countered saying the variation was actually Android's strength
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.520]   Nobody gets 100% upgrades. It's impossible
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.640]   Rubin said before suggesting that Apple's purported 80% upgrade rate was actually closer to
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.880]   60 or 70 he did agree androids upgrade rate was much lower. This is from the verge
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:11.040]   That said that his new ventures ambient solution ambient OS had a solution for that which he didn't explain
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.440]   Magic well, he said it's more of a managed service in the back end
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:15.960]   You know
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.840]   I mean part of the reason that it's so fragmented in Android is because you have so many
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.120]   Manufacturers of phones many of whom sell such cheap Android phones that they don't you know
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:31.520]   There's no aftermarket service and so they don't bother pushing out updates if he makes the you know
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.760]   The essential home and you know he could he could force updates. I mean it's that's not a
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.680]   Apple also controls at silicon which is inherently going to be more secure if you can control everything
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.880]   Well and more to the point Apple has the carriers by the short hairs and forces them to push the updates out
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.640]   Which nobody Samsung even can get the carrier
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.160]   I was doing my security update. I think last week and my phone went into the the
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.960]   Boot loop cycle and now I have a new phone
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.920]   I know who gave you that new phone
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.880]   Uh google did because it was still under warranty. I'm
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   Six months into you know six months post pixel so I didn't want to buy a new phone. So I just
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   They had a their lawsuit was settled. I guess tell you what when I'm through with the essential phone. I'll send
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   I'll be bored with it within months
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.920]   Like a 360 camera
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.440]   They didn't say all you do is you sign up for it. Oh, they'll tell you what's chroma. This is update rate
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.480]   Oh chroma. I said I'm sure is almost 100 because that's right
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.920]   And we force it right
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   There does an interesting counter example of an OS that does manage to update itself at the time
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.840]   But that's because it's a browser based OS so it it only works if you have a kind of connection
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.320]   So it's it's it's forcing the issue in that one right and there's no way to turn off updates
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:57.360]   It just happens you can run it without a web connection if you could you could just continue to be safe
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.760]   You'd also be safe
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.920]   So it doesn't really matter
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.360]   Yeah, it's like chroma was it's just like chrome it gets automatic updates and and uh and it just
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.280]   Yeah
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   And I should say
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.720]   According to I think it was the wired article that talked about this with the essential
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.320]   One of the things they're talking about with the essential home is that it's going to support
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   like home kit and
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   the echo and
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.880]   Nest and all these other things so it will be cross platform. That's good. Well
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   So the way they did it is they
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.640]   reverse engineered the public apis which
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:39.360]   I always caution people when that happens that's great for early adopters, but for normal people they're going to get really pissy
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.520]   when you know
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.240]   Google or apple changes their api their public facing api and doesn't tell
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.160]   Essential and then poof. Yeah, that's always a bad way to do it
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.520]   You want an sdk and you want to approve way of doing it instead of reverse engineering the calls
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:01.360]   So and I still have questions because they they threw in home kit, but I don't know how they're going to do that without a certification chip
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.640]   so
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.320]   mystery
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:11.040]   So the other thing I spent money on this morning was the nest cam iq that oh you doofus
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.240]   Really on the doofus
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.960]   I've given you a doofus
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.160]   I'm a goofus and a doofus a seat doofus
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.480]   So we haven't seen anything new from nest in a while, but we'd heard rumors of this it's a
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:32.160]   4k security cam, but you don't get nobody wants to push 4k over their Wi-Fi network but high def is bad enough
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.920]   You don't want to push the 4k so what it does is and I've you know
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:42.080]   There's the mevo camera does this too. It has a 4k sensor, but it only takes a portion of the 4k sensor plus
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:48.320]   They say it will recognize members of your family and let you know if the guy is creeping in the window
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.680]   Is your brother-in-law or a bad man?
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.960]   That guy was clearly bad. He was wearing all black. Yeah, it didn't look good. Oh, and but she's okay
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:03.680]   So what was this was this a mistake to buy this stacy? Don't tell because it's expensive it's 200 bucks
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.600]   So no it should have been 300. I'm sorry 300 bucks. The second one was 200 bucks. I bought two of them
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.880]   Okay, so here's my take on this
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.160]   You doofus. I'm a doofus. That's your take
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:25.040]   Okay, so is there better stuff out there? Is that what you're saying? Oh, yes, so it depends
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   If you run a really fancy camera and
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:36.240]   I have not seen the nest cam stuff like in my life because it's not out yet
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.400]   So I might I reserve the right to come back and be like leo. I'm sorry I called you a doofus
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.000]   but
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I think for most purposes
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.640]   Though the nest the original nest works fine and my favorite camera. I have an habit right here
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:55.120]   Oh, the net atmo presence. It's not hooked up to anything right now the net atmo presence
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:01.520]   It costs it looks like a canary or something like that. It's one of those standalone camera devices. Yeah
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.600]   Yes, it doesn't have it doesn't have all the sensors like temperature and stuff
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.360]   But what it does that is awesome is it does actual facial recognition and it has for years
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.960]   and
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.880]   It also doesn't store this on the cloud you can upload your files to dropbox if you want
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.640]   But the default is to an SD card
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:25.760]   So what's cool about it is it recognizes members of your family and it does things automatically like when it
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:31.760]   Doesn't see anyone it recognizes for a while. It's like oh, no one's home. I'll turn I'll arm the rest of the house
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   so I arm the system so
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.240]   It's like the future in a lovely little camera thing that costs $300 and you don't have to send everything to the cloud
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.680]   and
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.520]   If I were gonna look at the nest the only thing that the nest offers
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.400]   is slightly fancier like the
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.360]   I'm gonna call it picture in picture even though it's not it's the ability to zoom in on
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.960]   Bad stuff or interesting stuff. We'll call it that
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.040]   and
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   Let's see what else does it have?
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.680]   If you want the familiar face alerts, you have to subscribe $10 a month or $100 a year
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.640]   Right. So yeah
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.480]   So oh yeah, or so again Leo. Yeah, this guy
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.040]   Well, I have to review it. I didn't I'm not like
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.200]   You know, I know you think I'm not it's I know it's confusing
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.000]   It appears as if I'm buying this stuff and kind of putting it all in my house in the closet
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.320]   But i'm review we want to review this
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   So i'm buying it for review purposes just like the essential phone
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:41.120]   Yes, that's just my job and I don't like to take free review units. I like to actually try these things in
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.920]   in in vivo
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.480]   I I spend many many many dollars. It's expensive to keep up with this crap
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.320]   Six corn process. So I will look at the net net atmo
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.160]   I guess what we need you to do is a run a rundown of all of these
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.760]   Oh, wait, is that an assignment coming? I'm going to give you an assignment because
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.920]   Well, there's and then if there's not just the net atmo. There's also
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.720]   the canary, right?
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.440]   So I like the canary. I mean, I've tested all of these so far
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.320]   um, which one do you like the best?
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.400]   For
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.520]   facial recognition and stuff. I like the net atmo the best
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.720]   I think the array of sensors on the canary is really interesting and maybe more utilitarian
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.440]   But if you just want camera and facial recognition
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   Um, oh, I have tried so I didn't love the canary flex because it didn't play well with my arrows
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:40.960]   It doesn't play well with mesh. They said they're they're working with that. This is not a silly problem. This is another issue. Yeah
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:49.200]   Well, it's other than my arrows. Well, the need atmo says it's a it's a healthy home coach a smart indoor climate monitor
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.280]   Am I looking at the wrong thing?
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.440]   Um, yeah, that's a different thing. That's the temperature
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   They have a temp they have an outdoor weather station
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.960]   and
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.600]   Cool stuff and then they have oh yeah. Yeah, okay. Something else. So I want the indoor security camera with face recognition
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.720]   They're outdoor security cameras really interesting too because it plugs into your existing light wiring and then it's got it's kind of
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.840]   I don't know if I love the design but and then it when it detects motion that little light comes on
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.080]   It's kind of like what the ring has with this outdoor camera
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.360]   This is cool because the net atmo security camera will put
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.120]   What goes to your apple watch and tells you who's who's who came in lily just came in
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.440]   Yeah
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:35.680]   They've been they've done this for so long these guys have been really forward thinking about how to communicate with things like notifications
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:42.640]   So like instead of I've detected motion. They're like hey, I saw Andrew in the kitchen and you're like thanks, dude
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.280]   That's that actually is cool. Yeah, you know, I love how how this and the google stuff
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.200]   They're shown is not is is slowly but surely it's a conspiracy making facial recognition. Okay
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.880]   And putting it in your house your house keeping an eye on what you're up to
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.320]   I don't I don't actually keep cameras in my house. I'll be honest
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:10.480]   You don't look at how do you test these things you tape over? I test it. No, I test them
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.520]   We have we have the camera area
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:19.680]   Everyone in the house knows that the camera is there the wigs and costumes near them. Yeah
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.960]   When we tested the canary it was a problem because it's air quality sensor
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.680]   The part of the house where I had it. It was like
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.000]   You're gonna die. It was just constantly red. Did you keep it in the garage?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.120]   No, it's just it was like right by our front door
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.040]   Oh, yeah
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.200]   They're like just try moving it. So I moved it and that's pretty funny. You're safer
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.920]   So you think it was the outside air that was causing it to
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.720]   alarm alarm it could have been
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.480]   Just a vent blowing. I mean knows that's
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:57.840]   Was something on barbecue next door is it this makes it? Yeah, well, it's Austin. Somebody's always barbecuing next job. Yeah
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.280]   Well, so I don't think on that much of a doofus
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:07.920]   All right, yo, maybe I maybe I was a little excited for a fact
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.320]   Well, I nearly adult I didn't know and this is why it's hard with about the net atmo security cameras
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.720]   So the well, I know in their french some people don't like them because oh they're french
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.880]   We we
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.240]   Okay
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.400]   Don't you think though that a google company like nest will do a better job of facial recognition? I'm not is that just my own prejudice
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.520]   Uh these guys have been doing it for years and they're perfectly fine
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.880]   I mean
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   Is good. Yeah
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.520]   It is. I mean like I bet what's crazy right right now if like my housekeepers come in
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:49.280]   You know, they're not for a while. They weren't recognized and then we recognized it because it was annoying, but um
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:56.960]   How crazy will it be when your friends come into your house the nest recognizes them and then tells you who they are based on their google
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.040]   Yeah, we have a very annoying neighbor that I would very much like to know when she comes in
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.800]   What does your annoying neighbor do she walks in?
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.240]   Or she walks into your house. Yeah, you know, alice kravitz. Yeah, it's kind of like
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.920]   Mrs kravitz
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.000]   She's a she's a little here's the service google
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.600]   When this face appears call my phone and then you can be like, oh my gosh. I have an emergency. Goodbye
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.720]   Yeah
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.440]   There you go. Well, it's funny because we've never had any security at all and
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.760]   well, we had a burglar alarm, which we never we never arm and uh
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:43.840]   I've never had any cameras in the house at all and I don't feel I never felt any need to have cameras in the house to be honest
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.200]   But I want to I should try these I feel like ever you know what it is. It's peer pressure everybody
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.280]   Oh, you gotta have a camera. Everybody's got cameras
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.800]   Everybody our family has cameras. My father-in-law has cameras on his front and his back
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.640]   And and my brother-in-law same thing and like they you can't hang out with them because they're always looking at their phone
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   or there's somebody in my yard
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   And it's like I don't want to know go ahead. Let them walk through my yard. It's not
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.720]   I have two camera use cases. Okay, but I love
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   The Arlo's we put them upstairs on our roof. We have a roof deck and like when it's thunderstormy like right now in Texas
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:27.280]   Our furniture can blow all over the place. So sometimes we're like we hear these loud thuds on the roof in the middle of the storm
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.480]   And I I've used the camera there to be like, oh
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   Okay, we're good. Nothing went over
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.840]   Um, so that's one
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.040]   And then two is we have doorbell cameras
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   And those are nice because you know seeing the packages and all of that but the added bonuses is when my
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.000]   Daughter leaves when I'm out of town
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.320]   Um, she always weighs at the cameras like
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:57.040]   And I get a little alert on our uh, my app. I kind of like now you don't use ring you use. Well, who do you use?
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.560]   So well right now I'm I'm finishing up a doorbell camera review. So I have five of them
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.600]   Um, what really which is the bet which one's the best one?
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:12.960]   I can't tell you yet. Um, the one I purchased and have normally is the um august, but I don't love that one. Okay
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.000]   And there's skybell there's rings
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.320]   Last year I said skybell hd was my favorite for the wire cutter this year. Yeah, this year
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   We're gonna shake things up a little bit. Oh, are you doing this for the wire cutter?
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.320]   Yep, we love the wire cutter. That's awesome. I love the wire. Yeah, or two
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.520]   Oh good. So you can tell us uh, what the best
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.320]   I mean, there's this I mean there's a car
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.280]   There's a certain level uh that they all achieve which I I mean
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.800]   I love the idea that I could see when some I can hear when somebody's at my doorbell
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:49.280]   I can I can see when somebody's on my stoop. I can talk to them all of those those basic features are really great
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.760]   But I would I'd be curious we're you know, obviously we have a ring on ours, but uh
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.560]   I'd love to know what else is out there
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.800]   Do you have the ring pro or the ring ring? I have the original ring because I put it huh
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:07.040]   Oh, I have to say they are a sponsor. Oh, yes, sorry car sense yelling at me
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.760]   They're not a sponsor anymore. So I know
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.600]   But they were at one point in time at one point they were responsive and they didn't pay their bills
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.160]   uh, so
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.320]   Oh, they're no longer responsive. So uh, you know, you get another one. Let me know
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.280]   um
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.920]   Uh, I guess that Richard Branson money doesn't go as far as you'd expect
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.960]   so uh
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.280]   But I know I like that basic feature
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.720]   But I but I'm curious if there's like one's better. Why would one what would make one better than the other?
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:47.520]   Um the biggest difference in them is the time it takes to have the image resolve
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.640]   And then the accuracy of the motion sensors. Yes, because sometimes that's a good point because sometimes
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.120]   Somebody will come to the door and it'll be 10 seconds before I hear the them arrive
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.960]   Right, and then that might be too late. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.760]   And then there's things like the bell
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.680]   Right
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.800]   It has to be it has to be close enough in time so that you can answer
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.360]   If they if they if you if you answer and they're gone, that's no, that's not much use
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.840]   But the there's there a little bit at the mercy of the internet on that
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:22.480]   They are I can tell you that my front door bell the original one that I had hasn't worked for like
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.240]   Yeah, this is why rings as so well because nobody's doorbell works
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.600]   Those things break right away
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.840]   My husband is not impressed with me
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.040]   It's like i'm sorry. When are we getting a working doorbell?
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.760]   I need a doorbell would you stop reviewing doorbells?
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:43.440]   All right, we're getting it done. Okay. All right. Let's take a break come back with more
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.480]   We're gonna talk about alpha go did so well at beating the world champion and go that it's retiring
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.400]   Oh, you know how that is it's gonna then go in a retire coming out of retirement tour
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.240]   And then it'll retire again. It goes on and on you've been we've been there
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.960]   Uh google for some reason thinks it's gonna take too much time
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.360]   to produce
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.920]   gender and salary information
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.360]   This is a company with a lot of computers, right?
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.840]   And
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.840]   Let's talk about google attribution

[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.760]   This is the holy grail for advertisers google now. Oh, yeah, we did we did
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.680]   Oh, actually
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.080]   The absolute contribute what is it?
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.480]   Attribute attribute attribute. Yeah, sorry
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.120]   This we don't attribute
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.960]   Attribute this one attribute. This is the credit card right track
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:23.360]   They can try they can tell they know so much about you. They can tell where a google ad will stimulate a brick and mortar purchase
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.240]   Terrifying
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:32.640]   I have to say I and I am you know up from watching the show that jeff and I especially are google fans
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.000]   We love google, but I do have to say after google.io
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.240]   After this, I'm starting to feel like I'm a little nervous
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.480]   that
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.040]   Google is everywhere in our lives
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.960]   And is becoming more and more knows more and more about us. I'm actually starting jeff talked me down
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.680]   I'm getting nervous about the privacy implications of google. I am fine with this
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.920]   I have no problem coffee fee
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.680]   Of tv
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   It's it's it's a transaction. Is it is it worth the value?
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.760]   But here's here's the problem. It's when you don't know so this morning joe scarborough
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.480]   uh was going on about
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:20.000]   The privacy starts being taken away and so so he is saying I don't like this
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.000]   He told the story about how he started running for the first time in his life
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.120]   And that he hadn't all he did was done was was tell me go on the phone that he was running
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.400]   He insisted there was nothing else he bought the stuff ages ago. He hadn't searched for anything. I don't believe this but suddenly he got
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.120]   Uh ads and said, uh, it's bs
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:43.040]   I know it's bs not true, but right, but the point is perception. It's a queen t-ding
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:49.200]   Uh, no, he got he got brain says I think he did do something that was a signal. Okay, um, but but
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   The problem is the perception is now
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:57.200]   Uh, even when they're when it is obvious when you know the reason when they're not watching you
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.240]   enough people are going to say they're watching me
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.160]   and and legislators are going to raise you about this so i'm
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.960]   They've got to be more careful about
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.560]   um
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.760]   Both companies about letting you know what they do why they do it
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.640]   And just be more upfront about it
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.800]   Uh as it happens so that you're you know, you never get freaked
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.560]   You don't get the creepy lunch because it's it's valuable services. We love having this stuff
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:28.160]   Yeah, but they it seems as if they're getting more and more data about us. It's good. It won't there be a
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.160]   backlash
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.560]   Well, uh, no a critical mass where they I mean just the fact that they can tell
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.040]   That you already have that critical mass leo
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:41.760]   They can tell you made a brick and mortar purchase based on a banner ad that was shown by google
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.840]   That so that's amazing and that worries me a little bit
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:52.240]   So what we need and this is I say this every time and I will continue to say this until it happens
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:47:01.200]   We really do need some sort of bill of rights around our data and our privacy and we have to have the government
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.480]   Do this and I know it sucks
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.760]   Government sucks and it's a painful process, but we need
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.880]   We're going to freak out until we have assurances and rules around this stuff
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.120]   and we are right to freak out about it and
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.160]   I wish the industry would be a little bit more proactive about it because
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.560]   Otherwise, google's going to face a huge backlash and this is not
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.800]   I am not a person who's like yay government. Let's do it, but
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.440]   There's really no other way
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.680]   We are in weird territory and the information they have is scary
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:43.280]   A lot of people are unaware of it and what they are aware of is probably the worst case scenarios, which just puts them all further
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.320]   It's how are you Stacy? How about
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.760]   Don't forget right now. It's government that is getting rid of all protections
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.080]   They're allowing your phone company to sell stuff. This guy. This is government. I'm gonna do it. I am well aware. Yes
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.760]   It's her senators. It's corn running and cruise. Yeah, yes, they're loving people
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.640]   so
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   How could but I think
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.320]   There could be almost kind of a
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.000]   Cultural convention around this if you if you in the university and don't mean to mind
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.920]   Convene people across various sectors of society to start to come up with standards for this
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:26.720]   I think that's a legitimate thing to do because otherwise what's going to happen is we will we will get the regulation that europe brings
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.240]   And it should be international. I mean these should be things that are
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.280]   Yeah, I don't want I don't want
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.120]   China's Iran's Brazil's all right
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.920]   But see this is the problem. He is international. Yeah, right?
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:50.720]   But there's no consensus international consensus on what privacy should be protected and what shouldn't
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.200]   And as hard as I don't want to be a rules. Yeah, so go ahead Kevin
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.840]   So we tend to get the American rules rather than European rules
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:04.160]   So the American companies will say well the the way to do this is the is the way that we've considered it in America a lot of the time
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.080]   That is changing as their market markets move, but that that's historical
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.520]   Status of things like ISP privacy, you know
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.320]   In the United States we're dealing with two things right now one
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:21.040]   The repeal of the FCC decision to make ISPs ask our permission before they share our information with marketers
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.200]   And two of course we're looking at a repeal of any net neutrality
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.120]   Regulations there's even a bill in congress to force that
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:36.240]   Um, what is this what is the status of that in the UK? I know you I know you're actually dealing now with the not just the stupor's charter
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.880]   But an even more draconian proposal from both the conservatives and the liberals
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.600]   And um well more from the conservatives than from labor
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.080]   Um, but that's that they're making part of the election campaign at the moment is is you know
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.840]   The prom secretary was on in the debate tonight saying we want to intercept more things and we want to be able to break encryption
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:01.440]   And it's you know that in some ways are asked if the impossible, but there was that that's the that's the position
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.960]   They've been taking for a while. The other thing that we've got is the the
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.840]   European data protection directives that are coming through
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.760]   um and
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.200]   The because of the Brexit stuff UK companies are
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.400]   Humming and horing about those, but there's they're still going to come in before we leave and it would make sense for them to
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:24.320]   Follow along with them anyway, so that I think that is that what you mean by we're getting European regulations. Yeah
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:30.000]   GDPR is that what's called killing GDPR? That's right. Yes. Yeah, it may may
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.600]   This is a really big law with teeth because it's it's a huge fine
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   It's like is it 20% or 10% of your revenue or a minimum fine of like a crazy amount
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.480]   in trying to remember?
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.840]   In my book public parts, um, not to plug that but um
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.560]   I argued that government
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.600]   Patrays itself as the as your great protector of privacy
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   But government is the worst threat to privacy because government has through the IRS and police and so on all kinds of means
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.760]   to exploit
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:08.800]   Your privacy against you, uh that no one else has so I do but
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.280]   I'm sorry
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.080]   I'm just saying I don't trust government to do it and I think that that self-regulation from the companies themselves doesn't work
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.440]   Is no one's gonna you know facebook comes out with new privacy stuff and everybody's suspicious
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.560]   So I think they're I'm agreeing with you and I'm not saying government shouldn't have a seat at the table
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:33.120]   Uh, but I think it'd be better if there were some kind of uh independent organization that the companies agreed
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.760]   to join in
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.280]   And endorsed self regulatory standards
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:49.680]   I worry that the teeth there there is no teeth there the economic incentive to abuse someone's data or a group of people's data is pretty high
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.520]   And so I feel like you've got to have a pretty big stick to beat them over the head with and self regulation
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:02.320]   Doesn't have that and the government should have rules allowing like dictating what it can access too
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:09.360]   Um, and we don't have that I was part of a I was part of a group of pardon me for this uh Davos
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:16.720]   Uh that that went through privacy and and and there were a lot of and so people like uh Vivian Redding who have
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.400]   Embasted from the EU were at these sessions and others for the ftc and so on
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.160]   And there was a lot of persuasive work there that says that
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.800]   advances we could make in
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.080]   um
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.680]   medical data
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   Could be thwarted badly
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:41.600]   By privacy and that we have to also sell the advantages of sharing that we can't just concentrate on what goes wrong
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.160]   number one. We've got a
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.280]   Also look at the positives here. So we know what we're balancing
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:54.000]   And then number two what was number two? I had a number two. I swear I had a number two number one's bad
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.320]   Was it um
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.800]   Yeah, so so we have to look at the advantages and oh I know we have to look at actual harm
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.560]   The creepy line cannot be used as the basis. Oh, that would be creepy is meaningless
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:13.600]   And is a dangerous standard. I just there's something about that. It's not a standard for regulation
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.080]   So you have to go to actual harm
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.400]   um and and and and then I can start to get behind it but again, I just
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.720]   I
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.960]   I know I'm sounding like a libertarian. I'm not everybody knows and I'll get a good
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.040]   Complaints on twitter tomorrow. I've been saying that i'm a democrat
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.640]   um
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:38.560]   But but in this way I have my libertarian streak that I don't trust government to be smart enough
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.800]   to be a
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.000]   Future thinking enough to understand it systematically
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.840]   Um, but you're absolutely right the companies aren't doing it either
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.680]   um
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.040]   So I think we have you know leo needs to call a privacy convention
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.440]   I'm just glad i'm going to be dead in a few years because I don't think there's a solution for this
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.280]   This is just a mess
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:05.200]   It is and I would say jeff I agree and there are efforts like to donate your data to medical science
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.000]   And those kind of things are awesome
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.840]   But but you have in that case you give informed consent. Yeah, it's still no, it's not just a nation's DC
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.040]   I'm gonna disagree there. I think that that that um
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:24.400]   Uh, that's not enough. That's not enough data. Uh if you have a confluence of cancer in a geographic area
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.160]   Um
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.680]   Then you find out that there's a little
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.400]   From hospitals you get that data from doctor
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   No, that was hipo right now. No
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.120]   No, it's it gets locked down in every which way
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.600]   And and uh, no, there's too much fear of letting any of this stuff loose
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.160]   So we don't compile it because of the fear of privacy because we've gone overboard with the fear
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.240]   This is a website. We have sold the benefits and call the recode project
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.960]   Thank you kevin for posting this in the chat room policy recommendations for open access to research data in europe
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.200]   Yes
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.400]   Seems like a good idea, but is there uh, is there a support for this kevin?
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.440]   Um, there's I mean, there's this is one of the one of the things that there's pain talks about in you know
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:12.000]   Along with the gdp r stuff and so that the the researchers are talking about exactly what you're saying. They're saying
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.680]   Just as you carry an organ donor card you should carry a data donor card
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:22.320]   And say that your data can be used for medical research and they would have encouraged people to think about it in those terms and then put some constraints about
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.000]   You know
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.960]   You know some corresponding things that make sure it does comply with gdp r
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:33.920]   um, and you know the challenge is always an minimizing it well enough and and that that's always been extremely hard because
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:37.520]   For the data to be useful for medical research. You need to have those
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.960]   You know you haven't need to know that which hospital was it from and at which point you can get to the patients fairly
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.880]   You're fairly easy and de-anonymize it again. So it's it's not it's not a straightforward problem
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.400]   It is it is very hard to do but there's a lot of people trying to think about it
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.040]   um the gdp r stuff I think
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.520]   that's um
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:01.120]   There's a bunch of pieces around that that make a lot of sense and they're and they're trying really hard to make these things coherent
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.320]   um
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:09.920]   But it's it's awkward when this is combined with the kind of of of surveillance stuff that the the the government is pushing here
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.840]   because that
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.240]   That tends to be done in this sort of covert way that that breaks all the rules and and that has you know
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.640]   That was the concrete thing where um
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:25.440]   Hording vulnerabilities led to the hospitals closing across the UK. I don't get the sense that gdp r is aimed at government
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.400]   though. It's aimed at private businesses, isn't it?
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.040]   um
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.560]   It's both
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.600]   really both
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:38.560]   I mean, what is what is the 4% of the annual global turnover of a of a government?
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:44.080]   But the point is the the the the the rules and the thinking about it
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.960]   um
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.280]   Is supposed to apply to government institutions as well
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:54.880]   This by the way is law and we'll go into effect almost exactly a year from now may of next year may 25th
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:02.560]   And you give up 4% of your revenue. Yeah, if you're in violation, which if you're a large enough company
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:07.360]   And you can get fined 2% not having your records in order
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.760]   Ah, this is going to be used as a cudgel
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:16.880]   You publishers are going to are going to are going to allege gdp r violations against facebook and google in a flash
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:22.800]   I predict it. But some of this stuff. I mean, I can't disagree with under the gdp r breach notification is mandatory
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.160]   Where a data breaches likely to result in a risk for rights of freedoms of individuals within 72 hours
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.480]   I mean, look how long yahoo sat on its
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.840]   Yeah, i'm fine with that. Well, yeah, but did they know that you're stupid to know the right to be forgotten
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   That's one that's challenging because it changes the way the internet works
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.400]   Data portability. I think that's a good thing privacy by design
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:52.240]   I think that's a good thing data protection. Well, that's that's an awesome privacy by design is a really hard thing to talk about
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:59.520]   Yeah, it is. So I here's a question because this is something I think about a lot because this is such a thorny issue
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:06.720]   And we've never historically we haven't regulated but this way, but with privacy violations
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.880]   Should we be thinking about regulating by outcome in terms of like
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:19.520]   And again, this is hard, but like I know that if I donate my data to medicine
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:25.040]   I'm cool with it going to help cure cancer. I'm really not cool with an insurance firm
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:31.520]   Using that data against me to charge me more or just to deny me insurance for example
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.800]   So this is where you there's a there's kind of a blockchain of your data at what permissions you've given
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.720]   Complex
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.040]   But there's a there's a possible structure there. Yes, I agree
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:48.400]   So yeah, because these are these are the things like when you use data for redlining you're like well, that's crappy
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.840]   But yes, that data's good for other reasons
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.600]   But here's the caution Stacey
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.640]   It's like hospitals are bad. Yeah, so if you're new
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:05.200]   If you the redlining thing is like, okay, which hospitals which areas are bad and is their band coverage in particular neighborhoods
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.840]   And so you end up doing that in
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:14.960]   You do you know doing those that you do that kind of research to say actually this hospital has the bad treatment practices that we need to
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:21.520]   Attack and so you you end up having to have that kind of geo cutting data attached to it as well. So
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.840]   You know it and it does depend on yeah, it depends on
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:31.840]   Transparency for the how the data is used as well and that is but that is much harder to achieve
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.880]   And it's particularly hard when you're using machine learning on it because you've been in a lot of the time
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.200]   Actually giving you transparency back
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.680]   You know if you're using the edit to set policy
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:47.840]   That that's great, but you need to say how you're using it as well and that and then then you can expose the kind of
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.320]   you know treatment based discrimination or
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:56.080]   neighborhood based discrimination or you know preexisting condition basic discrimination stuff, but
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.040]   Yeah, that's that's the trade-off
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040]   It's hard
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.480]   Yeah, and and it's really hard to I think your your ai point is important Kevin because
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.920]   Because you know this data point has these conditions attached to it
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.360]   but we don't know what we could learn from that data in in future systems and and
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:20.880]   You know part of what Europe looked at was not limiting it when it comes to research
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.680]   uh, but then again
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.440]   Private companies are coming Google is coming up with things that can help people
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.120]   um
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.800]   I don't think it's just that the academic researchers are okay and Google's not that's a wrong presumption too
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.120]   It's information at the end of the day. I think we have to keep in mind something here that
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.480]   Information flowing freely in society is a good thing
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.160]   um
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   And we need the conditions that enable it
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:58.160]   Oh, but it is not always it is not always well. It is not always the thing forever. I didn't say always and that's that's the challenge we have here is
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.960]   information is not a benign thing it's it's power and
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.480]   Right now consumers and individuals have very little power over their information
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.000]   And that is legitimately frightening for them because they are being manipulated. They are being
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.800]   you know paying a price for things that
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.520]   otherwise they may not and
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.360]   Gotta talk about the positives of information and knowledge at the same time
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.240]   If all we do is concentrate on the bad that could happen then that's this is how we end up in this discussion
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.880]   This is why I wrote a book about this because I was so concerned. Nobody bought it, but that's that's another problem
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.800]   I'll send it to you. I'll send it to you
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.840]   um
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.440]   because
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.280]   There's a balance to be struck and the discussion now is almost entirely on the fear side and the what can go wrong side
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.840]   And not on the positive benefits side that we there's a societal benefit that comes
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.320]   At some level
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.000]   There is and I I talk about that a lot with like iot when people diss on iot. I look at things like
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.840]   Creating true energy efficiency across, you know neighborhoods and cities in there
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.880]   There's so many benefits to applying this but there
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:16.640]   Those are those are hard
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.360]   Those are hard to talk about when there are so many people trying to use it for perhaps material gain
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.440]   and
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:30.080]   Maybe we just need better public publicizing of this other the positive things. I mean
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.760]   I don't know. I mean this is again. I agree with you, Jeff. It's super hard
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.800]   It is really challenging. Yeah, yeah
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.880]   What is so kevin says did you see steven fry speech? What what did mr. Fry talk about?
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.160]   He's he's last I heard from him. He was getting off twitter because everybody was mean
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.440]   So he came up gave a very long speech at the hay on wide book festival
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.840]   um about the future technology and gutenberg
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.840]   And
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.880]   Wow
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:13.520]   So jeff jeff would enjoy this but we may need to go away and read it until next week or something but it's
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.280]   um
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.920]   Read it read it. Well, there's a transcript on steven fries. There's a transcript. Yeah, I'll see you link to the transcript
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.120]   I think the thing that there is a video, but I
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.960]   He is you want his delivery. Anyway, go ahead kevin. Sorry
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.840]   It is long. Um, but it's I mean the thing is that he was it's it's long
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.960]   But he was talking to a literary festival, which is kind of the fun part of this
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:44.400]   He's so he's talking to them about tech and being the interpreter of tech to them. So it's it was um
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.080]   And he doesn't come out with with a with a lot of recommendations. He you know he
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.840]   He's his answer is this is kind of hard as well
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.120]   But we don't want to just leave it to the to the tech companies to think about this with the rest of us need to pay attention to
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.440]   I think that's the sort of high level thing of his
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.600]   of his speeches and the the the challenge is is that
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.600]   We don't necessarily want the reaction to how we use all this to be decided by
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.560]   A small group of people who live on the west coast of america and that's that's that's that's part
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.560]   This means you think about how else you use it as well
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.200]   Um, because they're there world view may not match everyone else's and I think that's the I think that's kind of what you were trying to say
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.680]   Stacey is that um a lot of
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:34.960]   Data is good, but it's it's a lot less worrying if you're already relatively comfortable relatively powerful
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:40.080]   And it's much more worrying if someone can use it to have power over you and that's that's the piece that's very hard
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.960]   Here's a just a little excerpt
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.000]   From uh his speech he's talking about
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:54.400]   It's nothing sort of scandalous to be in the middle of a general election in 2017 on the very brink of this awe-inspiring terrifying
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:02.160]   Scarcely credible but unquestionably real and imminent revolution and find that politicians are skating not to where the puck is going to be
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:07.280]   Not even to where the puck is but as ever to where the puck used to be
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.720]   Westminster's records is pretty grim in this
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160]   So I would just say
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.480]   You can argue convincingly that one of church's greatest qualities
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.960]   one which um
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.320]   Helped him perhaps tied turn the tide of the second world war was his openness to science and technological development
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:36.000]   As shown in the science museum exhibition a few years ago dedicated to his role in that sphere
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.680]   The development of radar which he supported was of course a vital part of the victory in the skies in 1940
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.360]   So now too has been calculable importance in the battle of the Atlantic
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.680]   Churchill always listened to his scientific advisor lord charwell whom he called the scientific lobe of my brain
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.680]   He got behind wonderful inventions and developments like the bouncing bomb and operation windows gyroscopes
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.400]   And of course he sent that famous five-word note
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:07.360]   Concerning mysterious money that was disappearing into dolce hill and blechley park and that the treasury couldn't understand
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.320]   Churchill had gone to visit the colossus vacuum vacuum tube computer
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:18.640]   Tommy flowers was building to help decrypt enigma when he came back after having seen it he wrote a five
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.880]   word note
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880]   Give them what they want
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.920]   That short notes could be regarded as one of the founding documents of digital computing
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:34.880]   But of course you could justly observe that so did hitler exhibit a loving and a belief in science
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.640]   And that is of course true as church and himself in one of his best notes speech
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:43.360]   He said if we fail in the whole world including the United States
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.600]   Including all that we have known and cared for will sink into the abyss a new dark age
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.560]   He's good
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.680]   You wish I think he's a professional
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.920]   There's a church right now he should have played church. Oh, yeah
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   and
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:12.080]   To complain about the you know the neutrality is
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.880]   Technology will work for wicked people and for saints as marshal mccleone observed
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:25.440]   It is to complain about it is as witless as cussing a buzzsaw for loping off your fingers and complaining that you never saw it coming
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.600]   The wit the witlessness of our leaders and of ourselves and I glue myself is indeed a problem
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.400]   The real danger surely is not technology, but
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.320]   technophobic
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:45.120]   Knutism a belief that we can control change or stem the technological tide instead of understanding that we need to learn how to harness it
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:54.640]   Driving cars after all is dangerous, but we developed driving lesson requirements traffic controls seat belts maintenance protocols proximity centers emission
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:01.680]   Standards all kinds of ways of mitigating the danger so as not to deny ourselves the life-changing benefits of motoring
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.880]   We understand why Ned Ludd destroyed the weaving machines that were threatening his occupation
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.160]   Um, we understand why French workers took their clogs
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.760]   Their Sabo as they called them and threw them into the machinery to jam it up giving us the word sabotage
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:21.200]   But we know that they were in the end if you're pardon the phrase kissing into the wind
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:24.320]   No technology has ever been stopped
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.200]   So what is the thesis i am nailing up?
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:35.280]   Well, there's no authority for me to protest against no equivalent of pope leo the tenth for it to be delivered to i'm certainly no martin luster
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.440]   The only thesis i can think worth nailing up is absurdly simple
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.760]   It is a cry as much from the heart as from the head and it is just one word
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.160]   Prepare
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.560]   We have an advantage over our hunter gatherer and farming ancestors for whether it is winter that is coming
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.760]   Or a new spring is entirely in our hands so long as we prepare
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.880]   Unlike martin luther i thank you for your indulgence. Thank you very much
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.560]   Steven friday's the coda of his speech at the hay festival so now we're long you can actually watch the whole video
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.400]   We're we're we're on the bbc. Yeah, the bbc has it
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.800]   Mind it if i just googled hay festival a steven friday and
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.880]   The transport yeah, it's not that's not in the transcript
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.520]   No, so the part of the treasure that link i just put in is yeah because of course it's the end of the speech
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.080]   But i think it's a good it's a good coda to our discussion
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.040]   Yeah, i don't think it yeah, it's not it's not obvious what the answer is but we but we still have to prepare
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.280]   But the thing the thing that i liked about it
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.240]   Um, yeah, i didn't see all of it live but i did read the transcript was was his
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.920]   him saying
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.040]   We need to be thinking about this we need to pay attention to this this stuff is important
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280]   Right, um and just
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:54.000]   reactively making your me a mapping it your current talking points is is a is a shame
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.520]   And it's particularly a shame was you watched the uk election
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.920]   Um progress that that's broadly what's happening with the tech part
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.760]   It's also encouraging and it makes a point and i think this is really great that we you know
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.240]   We did do this with uh with cars
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.000]   That there is a there's a precedent for this it's as as intractable as this seems to me
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.880]   You know, we've done it before and and we do need to do it. We can't just sit and let
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:26.000]   It just happen uh, which maybe what happens but decades thinking our government is stupid
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.840]   It's incapable of doing things and that it's bad
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.000]   and it feels not that we're as naive maybe as people were in the 60s, but
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.760]   If we expect better, we might be able to get better and i i don't agree with you
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.200]   Maybe i'm stupid, but no the hard argument to make right now though, isn't it?
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.560]   It it is but like this is why i'm not leaving like there's there's so much of me
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:11:00.000]   It's like let's abandon ship and go to europe or canada or somewhere i can but i can't because
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.720]   Because i have faith in people i i have to right i don't know and i do think that government
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.520]   Is the only chance for solving this is government that you know i understand your your caveats
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   Jeff, but who else and government
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.560]   In the in its best sense reflects our interest as a society and it's our interest as society that need to be
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:29.840]   Protected this is where eric smith would say would you rather have government run google or google or google and i would rather have google or google
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.360]   I think that's a fun argument. Yes, it is it's specious
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   Go ahead stacy
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.120]   No, that was all i was gonna say yeah, it's specious because google can run google
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.600]   But it can't run google without any unfettered there should be
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.440]   No, i agree with that
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.360]   Larry page wanted to move to an island because he didn't like anybody to say tell google what to do
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:55.760]   But that's sorry google exists in a society and it's let's not use the word go over that use the word society
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.160]   Google exists in a society
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.160]   has
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.000]   It's well right now they're different because government is imperfect
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.600]   Your privacy rights more than anyone has i understand i'll just take it away all your privacy
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.920]   Well, the the point of an election is to find out what people want
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:17.360]   Well, yeah, we're there exactly why uh, you know i again i'm the liberal
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.120]   But in this case i'll trust the market more
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.680]   Well only because you don't like what the people said, huh?
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.440]   No, because no, no, this goes back further because i believe that right now
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.440]   The key change here and this was in what would google do?
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.840]   um, i mean i'm in plug day
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.360]   uh
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:43.600]   Was that that that now that everyone can complain loudly about any company the
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.560]   uh, the the public forget market for a second then the public's ability to
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.520]   Keep a company honest is greater than it's ever been
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:57.360]   And if you are this is the this is the genesis of don't be evil right being evil is bad business
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.720]   Because you'll get caught and it's going to be trouble
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.960]   uh, so
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   There there are i that's not to say that i i i agree that we need
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.920]   uh a broader discussion with more
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.600]   constituents
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:17.600]   With more guidelines possible with more opportunities to hold somebody against a known standard i agree with all of that
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.800]   But i do think the market is in better shape now to fight back against companies
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.720]   If i get back against
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.280]   Companies companies companies
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:34.000]   Badly behaving companies. They are if they know the market has no solutions for badly
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.880]   That's why we have any trust law. Uh, the market is no solution for poorly behaved companies if her bill or Riley would be
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.080]   Okay bill or Riley is a very different thing and he's been
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.880]   He's been in the press
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.920]   The most conservative people agree that there should be anti trust regulation
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.480]   Yeah, i'm not arguing with that leo i'm not arguing with it, but i'm
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.200]   Not anti trust but there's so much happening that people don't know about
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:07.360]   That the hard stuff think about all the good reporting that goes on that people don't pay attention to because it's
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:15.120]   God, it's so boring. Um, but those are the kind of things that public outrage doesn't solve because it's
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.000]   Esoteric it's hard i look at things like pharmaceutical pricing
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.800]   Lack of markets for vaccines or new antibiotics just in my journal industry either
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.760]   Right, that's why journalism should exist
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.960]   Well, i'm not saying that journalism can't do it alone
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.880]   Like i looked at the texas tribune in in texas
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.960]   They did this amazing thing about half a year ago about a child
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.680]   exploitation and sex workers
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.680]   Our legislature went in
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.200]   And just did nothing about it despite the fact that this is
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.720]   Great journalism about it
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.360]   Completely there were actual things that could solve it in our legislature was like eh
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.000]   Well, you can always bring up counter examples, but what but sure so
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.040]   I'll try to depoliticize it by using society instead of government does us do we not as a society?
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.920]   I understand do we not as a society?
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.280]   have an interest in
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.360]   protecting our interests against
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.200]   uh
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.720]   Corporations corporations have their interests and we have our interests and do we not have a right as society?
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.280]   To say to corporations, okay, you can do this
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   But what are the mechanisms to do that?
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:37.040]   Well, that's we only have one mechanism government is a reflection of society. I understand it's not perfect
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.560]   But what else is there? We also have market based solutions market doesn't do anything market
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.600]   Doesn't care about consumers unless you're in a are you at adam smith market?
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.000]   No, I'm saying there are multiple right now right now
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   That when it's giving this so many across the world government at the second. This is the irony of this right
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.680]   And i'm gonna get such crap people on twitter relax. You know i'm liberal. Just let me be liberal. Okay, i'm me
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.960]   This isn't even liberal. This is you're saying it's the invisible
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.600]   I am i get all kinds of crap leave the tech leave the politics off of twig. Let's go back like which is fine
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.080]   We can do that in two minutes. You're quoting billow riley now
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.160]   I don't know who i'm talking to no i'm not well, but here's no there's a paradox here the paradox here
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:26.320]   Is that timo i'm trying government forces one and that's why i don't trust government
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.720]   No the reason but they don't give up jeff good lord
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.920]   You're gonna end up on an island in the middle of nowhere
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:39.040]   But don't give up on on the public and uh, the other mechanisms don't give up on the on the public pressure that can be put by
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.440]   by the people by the public
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.440]   Only on government
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:50.000]   Don't give up solely on government is a tool of the people a government is it so i'm not handing it all over to them
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.240]   Yeah, and look i got to say stacey
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:59.040]   Your your point about privacy is right, but look who's ruining privacy in the united states of america today
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.280]   It is the government
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.960]   It's not just the government it's data brokers. It's uber. It's
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.760]   Man
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:15.040]   And the worst fear of course is a collusion between private industry, especially google and facebook and
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.680]   Maybe
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.320]   And government that would be the worst case scenario
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:26.000]   I agree. I mean if we have a government that is and we kind of do have a government at this point that is
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.240]   uh run by money in other words run by big corporations
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:36.400]   It doesn't do a very good job of protecting societal interests, but i don't know what other tools we have you think that consumers could just
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.560]   Rise up. I don't see consumers saying i'm not going to use google anymore
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.600]   So, I mean, okay
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.760]   I was a i was a teenage libertarian so
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.720]   Is that like a teenage werewolf?
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   That's a intellectual horror movie. Yes
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.080]   Yeah
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.600]   Back back in the in the uk in the 70s there was this like
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.320]   Government is doing too much the the trade unions have too much power
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:08.960]   There's there's a big problem with with society running and at that point the libertarian point of view the the heiichi and market
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.440]   Free market point of view was not getting much of a hearing and it wasn't a trying to alternative and that was
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.160]   That gave us
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.520]   That gave us Thatcher and Reagan picked up a version of that and
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.600]   And it it it solved the problem of
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.840]   Trade unions having too much power, but we're now at the other end of that cycle
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.600]   And we now have these the situation where the corporations have too much power and they have the same
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.880]   Lack of empathy with normal people that the trade unions had here in the 1970s
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:46.560]   And so we're having this weird election going on here now where there is the you know that the neoliberal consensus that
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:54.880]   um sort of blare took on board from the conservatives and said the way to do this is to encourage the city to do the right thing and
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:02.960]   To do that rather than to nationalize everything that consensus has broken down and the and the Labour Party is campaigning strongly on a
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.880]   And nationalization on a more control of the of services
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.200]   By the government because people see that corporations aren't doing a good job of it and that and that is getting a lot of resonance that you know
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.200]   They've picked up a huge
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:22.560]   Swing in the polls once they once make all the election and Corbyn started putting on TV and saying these kinds of things
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:29.280]   So we are seeing a swing back against that neoliberal consensus and it is we're on putting a lot of this because we you know
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.840]   We're used to that idea of the markets delivering
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.960]   But at the same time we can see these these kinds of flaws where people have too much power
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   Um, you know mark mark with hatcher famously said the trouble with socialism is eventually run out of other people's money
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.560]   Um, but that's kind of where we are with financialism eventually
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.720]   Eventually the city runs out of other people's money eventually the veg capitalists run out of it
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.160]   It was money and these these things start failing as well. And
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.280]   You know, we need to we just step back and say
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:02.960]   How do we balance these these two points of view and and what it comes down to is how do we think about?
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:09.520]   About people and how they're how they're treated and not chase the abstractions too far
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:19.440]   All right, I was just trying to end on a high note with steven fry, but I obviously let's get back to worship and technology. Please
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.920]   segue for you. So here's here's a segue. Let's see if we want to pick this up before you do the segue
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.000]   I want to do an ad so I have some capitalism
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.280]   But tell us what your segue will be and then I'll do the ad and then we'll do it
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.240]   I was like your ad's gonna mess with my segue. Oh man. You got your segue in my ad
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:39.520]   So here here's here's an example of the private interests
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.480]   Not necessarily aligning with consumer interests as read Hastings talk today at the code conference about
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:54.320]   his changing perspective of net neutrality. Oh, wow. What did he say? Oh, well, we'll find out after this word
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:00.720]   That's a tease. That's a really good tease now. I'm dying to know what happens
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:06.400]   Our show today how about a little capitalism? I'll just mix it in here with uh with the
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.280]   A little corporatism and along with that libertarianism
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.720]   Uh, there's a great guy who is an absolute capitalist
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.200]   His name is jay walker. You probably know him as the guy who created price line if you don't when how you do
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:25.200]   He I asked him when I talked to myself said are you the guy who hired uh, William shatner? He said, yep
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:31.280]   J is a great entrepreneur and and as with the best entrepreneur entrepreneurs, you know, he sold price line
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.400]   He can't he can't take it easy. He decided after his non-compete's wore out
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.960]   There must be another area that we could dis
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:46.000]   You know, disintermediate there must be some thing that's not working in the world and travel that we could make better and he found it
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.760]   Business travel if you're in a big company
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:54.960]   Uh, you have a travel department. You call them up. They make your travel plans for you
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.240]   They have pre negotiated prices with the airlines with the hotels
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.000]   The company likes it because the company knows it's going to get the best deal
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.640]   You like it because you don't have to do any work. It's a win all around but if you're not in a big company
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.560]   How does it work now? You're doing your travel booking
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:16.080]   The the company itself maybe isn't real happy with what you've booked first class all the way
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.760]   And and you're not getting the advantage of pre negotiated rates
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:25.040]   That's where upside comes in jays new company upside.com the better way to buy
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.680]   business travel upside
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.200]   Is very simple pick your pick your destination
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:36.800]   It'll now what's nice is they've got pre negotiated prices with a variety of airlines
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   And a variety of hotels
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.200]   It will offer you uh the best six deals right off the top

[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.720]   All right, stacey
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.360]   What the heck are you talking about?
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:22.160]   So netflix ceo read Hastings at the code conference
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.200]   Said that basically net neutrality
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.560]   He's not that he's not big on it this time around because it's over
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.840]   Big enough
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:37.440]   Well, he says quote. It's not narrowly important to us because we're big enough to get the deals we want right
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.080]   That's the point
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.960]   So
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.840]   Thanks
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.760]   Move it right along
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.440]   Bingo
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.560]   Geez
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.120]   Well, it isn't all right. Well, stacey. It's fair. It's not his battle. It's fair
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.680]   but you would think that is somebody who
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.560]   Came up on the internet that he would like to keep instead of pulling the ladder up after him
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.120]   Keep the internet free and open for the next guy
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.840]   But they've been big enough to do their own pairing agreements for years. Right thing. Yeah. Yeah
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.200]   Oh, of course
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.040]   And once they had that big kerfuffle with Comcast they and they won that and did their own peering with them
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.600]   They're like all right
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600]   we're good
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.920]   although wasn't it Comcast that
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.760]   Turned the dial down on Netflix to squeeze them
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.480]   So what they did oh
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:38.240]   Oh, all right. So what they did is they blocked certain ports, right? And then they also had they didn't buy more cables. They did
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.800]   They didn't connect more ports for them, but they they did say when Comcast so Netflix said hey
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.480]   We will offload this stuff for you because we have our own CD inboxes that will hold our content
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.760]   So this doesn't even have to be a problem for you. You've got so many people will just stick our boxes in your data centers near the customer
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:01.520]   Comcast was like no, we don't want to manage other people's boxes if we do it for you. We got to do it for everybody
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.400]   Meanwhile Comcast comes back to them and is like
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:13.040]   Here you can stick you can set all your traffic to the following two data centers to serve our entire user base around the countries
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.560]   And Netflix was like oh hell no, that is not a good deal for us
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.240]   And that's super complicated and expensive and so then they got in this massive fight
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:27.200]   It was highly technical and the bottom line is the FCC started to get interested because they were like dude guys work this out
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.640]   And I think didn't john Oliver do something on it too. Yeah, oh yeah
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   I look so I was very excited because I was appearing nerd. I am still appearing nerd and
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.960]   You want to complicate a subject man. If you understand that I'm impressed
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.680]   Nanog conferences
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.920]   um
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.560]   So so basically the point now is
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:52.480]   You know Netflix and Comcast they've done their deal
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.800]   Yeah, they
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.480]   As you said they're pulling the ladder up behind them. It's it's frustrating and even
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.880]   In dc and talking to people about this like it's up by southwest
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.120]   They were like no one wants to expend the capital and this this is not an issue for google and in the guys who fought it last time
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.560]   Right
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.960]   That's what's sad because it's uh and effect
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   I mean it affects twit
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.200]   It uh
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.360]   It affects uh the next twit
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.640]   Anybody who uses the internet. I mean I can easily see a situation where
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.680]   Comcast says well
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.120]   It won't cost you anything to watch Netflix or amazon
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:37.200]   But if you want to watch a video podcast from twit well, we're gonna have to you know, that's that's that's another matter entirely
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.040]   We're going to either to slow it down
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.160]   Or we're gonna it's going to count against your small band with cap
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.760]   Um, I and and forget twit. I already you know, I'm already made my business
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.640]   But about the next guy who's just starting out
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.480]   Yeah
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.800]   Keep our net free which is a uh a pro net neutrality
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.880]   A website is created. It's a little bit of a propaganda
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.280]   at chrome extension
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:06.320]   Called a removal of net neutrality simulator
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.680]   If you want to install it
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:15.440]   Uh, the net gets slow all of a sudden when you go to facebook, it says maybe you'd prefer my space
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.280]   when you
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.920]   You know, uh, should I add it? I don't know it's gonna screw up my internet really bad
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:29.360]   Okay, so so let's uh, let's let's see what want to stop the internet from becoming a reality voice or concerns
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.200]   Um
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.920]   Let's see if I what happens the little thing. Okay. Yeah, what's see what happens if I go to facebook.com
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:44.480]   This is a giver. Oh, this website does not function correctly on your ISP service. Please use my space instead
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:51.280]   Now I don't that's a little bit agit prop. That's I don't think it's real
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.880]   It'll be like that, but it's gonna be much more subtle and what's bad is it's
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.680]   People aren't gonna even notice I think
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.840]   Well, I mean this is a historic joke in that um if you remember who bought my space
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.800]   Um, but that's you know, it's
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.800]   Right
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.360]   Murdock who owns both tv companies and and let's be sure so yeah, yeah
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.960]   but but
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.400]   Okay, so
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.280]   I'm not sure if this is fully related, but it is it is kind of um
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:26.240]   Connect it it joins the thread back that so there's a bit and it's not a uk theme thing. So there's a story
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.480]   Um coming on in the uk at the moment in that
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.360]   The top song on the charts is going to be not be able to play it on the chart show
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.760]   Because it's a protest song that's private insta-ra-liar. Yeah
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:44.480]   Um and and the so this is an interesting thing where it's like
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:48.160]   And it's number one even though it's got no radio airplay
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:51.680]   It's what it's number one. I think it's i've never just quite number one iTunes yet
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:59.280]   But it's I think across because they now count iTunes and youtube plays and social media things in the charts
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.640]   Um, it's going to be number one in the charts and they're not gonna be able to play out on the radio
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.000]   Because they're in an election and they and they have got a duty to know
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.360]   Oh
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.680]   That's why they're not playing it. Oh
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:13.600]   Yeah, so it's like a fairness doctrine. Yeah, we didn't we eliminated that
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.160]   Yeah, yeah, okay. Now this I mean
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.440]   Well, the way it works here is you can't buy airtime
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.920]   um, but there are rules about
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:28.880]   Um, you're each party that has it's feeling enough candidates is given party people broadcast that put on the air
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.840]   Well, I can play it
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.440]   We have a mission to make Britain a country that works
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:43.040]   Not for the privilege or not for the field, but for every one of our citizens
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.640]   Together we zep Nigel for us
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.000]   Um, Boris this Boris Johnson
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   Boris
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:04.880]   I don't think you'd have seen this uh, CNN if it had been Hillary either
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:18.240]   Number one on apples, um, iTunes charts apparently
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.960]   Captain scar she's a liar liar
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.040]   So, I mean
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.880]   I'm not sure how that quite plays into this. It's it's an interesting counterpoint to
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.840]   You know the difference between the the way things work here and here and there in the states
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.880]   They would have played that as a as a commercial. You know, right? Yeah, absolutely
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:44.720]   That they would have said yes. We'll play as a commercial here
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:50.480]   It's a it's a grassroots thing that someone has put together on youtube and people are buying it because they find it funny
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:55.440]   And there's there's a great British tradition of that as well. There's there's a whole christmas number one thing that we can get into
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.640]   But although we did we did CNN did fire Kathy Griffin
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:05.200]   For a photo. Yeah, a photo. I which I did not see and I am not looking for it. I do not want to see
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:08.640]   Of uh, I don't know something negative
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.640]   I know what it was. I just don't I don't even want to say it. I would do it. Do you describe it? Okay
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.640]   No, please
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:22.240]   So you play okay. It was a little over the top. Shall we say yeah? Oh, it was and she realized it. Oh, yeah
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:29.200]   She felt bad about it, but CNN fired her. Here's an interesting um, side light on how privacy actually can help
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.320]   turns out an interesting study at harvard
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.480]   When wikipedia switched to https
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.760]   Which made it impossible for governments to see what stories you were reading
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:48.640]   It it turns out there was a direct connection to less government censorship
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.240]   Because governments don't want to block all of wikipedia
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.120]   They would like to just but you know block the
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.360]   Articles about tianim and square or well like I guess turkey doesn't mind blocking at all
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.040]   But there are most countries are censoring bits and pieces about it
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:07.600]   Well, mostly they want to censor a particular thing, but they end up blocking all of it
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:11.440]   Because right. Yeah, that's the only way you could do it. So I mean there was a
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:16.080]   There was an argument there was a happened in the uk because there was an argument about
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:20.240]   Is this album cover child pornography and it and the
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.880]   Blocoh child pornography list added all of wikipedia for a few days till they realized that was not quite what they should be doing right
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:34.000]   Uh the the study after a painstaking this is from motherboard painstakingly long process of manual analysis
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.440]   A potential censorship events the researchers found that globally wikipedia switched to https had a positive effect
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.680]   On the nut and reduced in other words the number of censorship events
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.840]   Because they can't see into what you're looking at
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:52.400]   right
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.400]   So there is an argument for
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.400]   just for privacy
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.440]   Uh when governments don't know what you're reading there less likely to censor it
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:06.560]   Chipotle says most of most of it's restaurants
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.040]   I think you might want to say all of its restaurants were infected with credit card stealing malware
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.200]   I am so sad this means i'm gonna have to change my credit card again
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:26.720]   Lord the malware search for track data which sometimes has card holder name in addition to card number expiration date an internal verification code
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.800]   On the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the point of sale device
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:39.040]   But there here's the good news they got your name your card number your expiration date and the internal verification code
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.120]   But chipotle said there's no indication of their customer information was affected
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.320]   Oh well never mind
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:50.080]   They got your all your quackamole
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.320]   Right
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.560]   Um, so the company suggests you file up. Okay. Wait a minute
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.360]   Check whether you're if
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.400]   See, okay hat were you at a chipotle between march
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:07.840]   24th and april 18th 2017 or another chain they own called pizzeria locale
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.040]   if so
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.720]   If so, you said the company suggests you file a police report
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:20.960]   Jesus contact the federal trade commission or price of fraud or alert a security freeze on your bank account
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:29.280]   Chipotle is not yeah, well, yeah, I don't know why if it if it was a day
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:35.440]   debit card. Yeah, okay. Yeah, chipotle is not legally required to offer credit protection for affected customers
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.760]   so
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.760]   I love this though not no
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.280]   Not even in the cala even in the state of california
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.720]   I'm just quoting the verge
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.640]   Nat garron
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.640]   He calls it exe dot coli
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:57.760]   I start to feel bad but like just
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.120]   It's just it's I figured the credit card companies, you know, we'll back you up
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.200]   If yeah, I mean my credit card. I think I'm on like my third one of the like in the last year
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.160]   It's a member. What happened with the target breach is the credit card companies were so pissed off at target
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.640]   They sued them because they had to send out new credit cards or they had to make the losses good
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:23.680]   So they sued him and it cost target a lot of money. I can't remember the number, but it was a very big number
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.960]   Well, I don't even need to do that. They can just turn up their fees
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.960]   Right and say okay, you know, you're you're now in the 7% bucket rather than the 2% bucket, right?
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.360]   Although then they'll just pass that on to the consumer. They'll be like we don't take credit cards and then
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.160]   Like no matter what
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:45.680]   We pay for it if it goes if it costs visa money if it costs chipotle money because
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.320]   Target money it all
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.440]   No, they don't lose money. They just charge us more
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.040]   Yep, adam smith's invisible hand
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.920]   What what
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.320]   Google has added a personal tab to your searches
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.560]   This is as far as I can tell just a an easy way to
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:13.520]   A fast way to search your gmail. So I I bought a
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.080]   Mail signing certificate from from global sign. So I'm gonna search for global sign
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.280]   And then under more I can make it per let's get personal
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.040]   I'm gonna get personal and then you could show this is nothing
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.080]   It this is in my gmail. These are this is the back and forth with global sign
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:37.600]   Haven't they done? Okay, so gmail is different, but haven't they done something similar like I know sometimes when I search for things it gives me like
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.480]   information that
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:48.000]   Based on information they have about me and it's like only you can see this results from google products gmail google calendar and google plus
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.840]   But they mix one boxes in that do that for a while. Yes, so if you search for something in your contacts
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.600]   You'll get your phone number, but it says this isn't a google result
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.800]   This is from your contacts
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.360]   Right and it does a bit more on android as well because android is
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360]   the search
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.280]   The google app there has
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.440]   Inside into bits of your phone that is necessary there on the on the web version
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.000]   But yeah, they've done this for a while, but they've been making it a tab just for that is interesting
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.280]   That's okay, but they're saying oh this this is you know
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.800]   This is actually searching your gmail actually searching google accounts
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   And it's giving you a reason to have a google account as well
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.760]   So I searched for a Comcast and on the personal results. There's a bill
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.600]   as well
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600]   Right purchases
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.600]   As well as Comcast email
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.320]   And if I had I think if I had an appointment with a Comcast technician that would show up there too if it's i'm like
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:42.560]   So they could be like unroll me and I could say eventually
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.600]   Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry y'all
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.640]   Sorry
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:50.720]   I could be like gee how much did I spend at amazon and it would be like
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   Well, there's services that will do that if you sign up for them. I go through I know like I'm wrong
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.600]   We haven't talked about google and its inability to
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.120]   Discuss how it pays people and we need to do that. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:12.080]   So that's sorry i'm not letting that go. No, you're absolutely right. We gotta mention this. Um, yep
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.960]   So, uh, you want to tell us stories, tacy while I uh, I pull up the link
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.960]   Um, so well, I mean that tell you the history the history
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:29.360]   The department of labor is suing to get data from google on how it pays female employees because it's concerned that it is
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.720]   Paying them less and is discriminating against them. I don't remember the law. It's using
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:41.840]   But google says um, we can't give you that information. Here's the story from the register
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.720]   Which of course it is typical snarky way
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:51.440]   Google can't spare 113 seconds of revenue to compile data on its gender pay gap
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:57.520]   Uh, google said if that it would cost them a hundred thousand dollars
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:02.240]   To to figure out whether they underpaid women
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:10.720]   Um, compile accurate wage data to compare women's income to men's income would be 500 hours of staff time
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:19.120]   So, okay, I don't know you know what I have a feeling that the labor department's not going to accept that excuse
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.240]   But we'll see
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.360]   But you know when in tech it's an excuse either and and google is a
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:33.200]   Ex-gudel is definitely mocking them. Yeah, yes. Yeah, they spent 150 million. They have a 150 million dollar diversity program
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.760]   Yeah, I was like how much have these donated to girls who code or black girls code or
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:45.920]   Well, I mean students spend that on it, but how much have they spent on the salary of the HR manager who who's completely failed to
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:54.640]   Um, improve their hiring process. Right. Well, do we know if google pays women less than men that would be a shameful thing
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.800]   Yes, I think that's what they do is that is the thought process and this is the data. They're trying to get
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:07.520]   So um broadly they do yes measurably, um and it's similar to the
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.600]   to other companies in that they um
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.720]   They hire women at lower lower wages at lower
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.360]   slots they promote them less well and
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.120]   Um, the attrition rate is higher so a few of them end up as managers
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.560]   Google does have some from senior women has has had a lot of senior women
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.480]   But their promotion system is has has been bad
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.480]   um kelly elis has written about this a few times and and said you know
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.880]   you know concretely
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.840]   the
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.040]   The system that they use doesn't necessarily um
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.040]   Because it uses performance ratings and existing
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:51.520]   Existing salaries, um, it means that any bias that starts is baked in is continued so um
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:58.800]   She came out of college and was hired into into front end development because because she was a woman even though she had experienced in back end
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.280]   Um because they they decided that would be the right place to put her. She didn't know
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.080]   And then to actually get through the promotion process you have to you have to show that you've overformed and so on
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:13.680]   So the the actual process is is it's very difficult. I mean she's there's a long
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.760]   Like there's long series of posts that she brought up this department of labor
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:24.240]   Department of labor said the investigation is not completed but this point the department has received compelling evidence of very
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:29.040]   Significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at google headquarters
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.920]   So uh, they're looking for you know more evidence from google google says well
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.400]   We can't afford to compile that information for you which sounds to me like
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.160]   For a company that has data data. Yeah sounds to me like
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:45.840]   Really google, you know
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.000]   It's a federal contractor. So one of the issues is as a federal contractor
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.760]   They're required to give the department of labor access to records and information about compliance
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.240]   So that that's one of the issues
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.160]   Um, so google has to as as a governmental contractor
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.160]   This is these like you can index the entire web, but you can't actually look at your own employee database
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.160]   It's not hard to believe yeah
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:14.400]   Yeah, kind of hard to believe that that is the challenge and you know
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.680]   Hopefully the government doesn't let them off the hook and I know I know google is not the only one but
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:25.840]   You what is that funny? You would think google of all companies would that's why this is so interesting
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:32.240]   Equally and not and be merit focused and not gender focused and and look at a coder
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.040]   I understand really probably some some of this anyways is what you were saying kevin
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:43.120]   Which is it's just it's just kind of a quirk of historicity or maybe even you could blame the previous employer because it
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.360]   I guess still yeah, it's biased. It's an end it
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.320]   It's a great that they're going to act. Oh
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.840]   Yes, I was gonna exactly google no when it google is like we are not gonna pay women equally
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.920]   Right most people at google are probably like but yeah, they need to
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.920]   They have to be forced into wreck it like realizing this and doing something about it and
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:12.800]   Then you know, if you don't walling is not the solution google no it never is I mean
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.480]   I mean it is it is more complicated than then
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:23.200]   Equal pay will work. It's also more opportunities for women minorities for better higher jobs
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:31.360]   So how you analyze this is going to be a both fronts promotion. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, churn things like that
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.600]   I mean, there's like there are tons of things that I mean as a woman who has worked in startup environments in tech
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.200]   There are tons of things that can push you out
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.920]   if
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.600]   If you don't have the support network at home
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:51.920]   If you're not working with people who are actively supporting you and trying to push things ahead
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.040]   I mean, there are a million days that you can wake up as a woman in tech and say you know what?
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.680]   I just don't want to deal with this bull anymore and
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:05.840]   I just want to say that my wife makes more money than I do so
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:11.280]   I mean, I you know
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.360]   But the funny the thing is you do you'd expect google of all the companies to be like bending over backwards
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.920]   Yeah, this is I took this picture at google.io when you sign up for your badge
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:24.800]   They say we care about your pronouns add a sticker to your badge
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:30.000]   to tell them whether you are they them or she her or he
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.680]   they I mean, it's uh, they they act as if they are really open-minded and really care and really progressive
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.920]   Well, but they you know, they're trying you know, they they they have an internal culture that is is trying to build this stuff
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.760]   Of course, and you know, the women in google groups and the gagglers and all those kind of organizations exist
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.840]   but at the same time they think that they are
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:46:00.880]   Naturally immune to this because they're so rational and don't and don't you know, don't introspect it and don't actually measure it very well
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.800]   And that's why that's why I was looking to kelly is think because kelly was saying exactly this
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.040]   Subconsciously they will decide that the
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:15.920]   You know the guy who looks like me is is is a better coder than the guy looks than kelly who's
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:21.120]   Here's here's google's cfo who is a woman rith pore at answering
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:23.840]   uh carris swisher at the code conference
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.760]   I'm gonna ask is about the google salary, right?
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.240]   Why will not you pay a hundred thousand dollars? Whatever? Why will you you won't give this information?
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:39.120]   To the federal government. So I think what you're asking about is the department of labor has um been through their federal contracting office is
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.720]   Doing an audit about gender pay equity. We are very committed to gender pay equity
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.360]   We've done a ton of data analysis and looked at
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:54.400]   um at job families and levels and based on that of said including equity because that's really including
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:02.240]   Absolutely full comp and based on all of the analysis are very comfortable confidence saying we we don't have a gender pay equity
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:05.440]   Well, yeah, I'm so glad for you to say that but why not release it?
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:11.200]   So we have given the department of labor hundreds of thousands of records millions of data pieces of data
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:19.760]   And the lawyers at this point are saying you know this next round of request is actually looking for personal contact information from thousands of our employees and
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:22.960]   our view is that uh, it's too much and so
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.880]   uh, you know having given them hundreds of thousands of records and millions of data points our view is that
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.200]   They've got they they have what they need and we're leaving it with with the lawyer
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.000]   Well, if you have all this data proving this why don't you put up a big splashy website explaining how great you are
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.920]   I think we have. I mean the way we've done our actual. No, I mean you guys like data, right? I'm pretty certain you like data
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:47.440]   I mean the data we've we've looked at again looks across
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.400]   It's it's job family level
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.760]   Performance rate the whole host of things and it's on that basis
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:59.760]   That have you ever thought of releasing that data to people to show this because it's because one of the arguments was we didn't want to pay for it
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.320]   Is is that they did do a report by the way?
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:08.320]   Gender diversity report in a gender equity report. Yes, they don't they release that information of some kind
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.880]   Um good for Cara for digging in on that, but I I think maybe uh Ruth Porat's responses
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.240]   Uh, well, no, no
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.440]   Sorry go ahead. So on Kevin. No god
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:31.120]   You know, yeah, she's she's she's giving the the company line the body line, but she's not but
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:34.080]   the challenge, you know, um
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.240]   Someone at google started compiling a spreadsheet of internal salaries
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:45.360]   Um, I'm breaking it down by gender and race and google shut that down so fast you would not believe and the woman who started
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.600]   Is no longer working at google right because they're really really sensitive about it because it doesn't actually like that. Well, yeah
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:57.360]   You remember that um and you know it happens over and over again and that the the challenges it's not the
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.760]   You know, you can you can always find one or two, you know
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.920]   um
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.840]   Suppose the cameras are like the cfo's a woman and and and so on
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.680]   But if you actually look at the experience day today of all the employees, it doesn't work out that way and it's very hard to
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.040]   To show that without actually having the conversation with the people who've suffered under it
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:22.160]   Um particularly in a company that is all is all about
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.720]   um
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.360]   Is yeah, as you say it's it's put it's internal image is that they don't do this kind of thing
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.360]   So when this kind of thing does happen people get away with it because they think that couldn't possibly have right
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.520]   Right and the stuff that the Susan Foster talked about at uber
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.360]   um
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.000]   Is more way more egregious than people have said at google
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.920]   But the but the same kinds of things and same trends are there and it happens a lot of these companies and it is a is a structural problem
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.880]   Stacy what were you gonna say
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.920]   No, basically less eloquently exactly what kevin said
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.800]   So there we have it and if we if we want to solve the structural problem
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:04.160]   Jeff we're gonna go full circle. We're gonna have to go back to the government government
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.160]   and we're gonna have to do like
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:09.520]   Charles the governor is the court. Yeah department of labor
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:13.760]   Well, but do you do that if you you know you you
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:20.960]   Existing laws you have to go to congress. You have to do things that that um yeah, I mean, I don't I don't I don't want to argue with that
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.680]   Uh
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:28.560]   Google says it is so good. It is so good at uh at machine learning
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.160]   That that it is now blocking 99.9 percent of spam and phishing messages and gmail
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:42.560]   Ah, it's also blocking a lot of other things. I don't I I still see spam. I get a lot and Lisa gets a lot of those messages
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.800]   Hi, my name is uh is uh
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.360]   Ramondo what you doing?
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:53.680]   My favorite is google blocks the white house because I signed up for the white house emails
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.080]   And they block it actually go into spam for me. Wow and I've never done anything about it
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:03.920]   So I'm guessing how to reverse that you could reverse I can no, but the point is like if you don't check your spam
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.000]   You're gonna get sure it
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.520]   It sends all kinds of crazy stuff
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:14.800]   According to google 50 to 70 percent of messages gg that seems like a broad range, but 50 to 70 percent of messages gmail receives are spam
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:19.760]   Right. So if they're only booking 99.9 percent of them, there's still a lot of
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:25.040]   Still some getting through it. Yeah, I think gmail does a very good job in spam. It does
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:28.800]   I do. I love I love gmail as a product. It is a wonderful product
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:33.120]   I pay for it. I have the same issues jeff does because of that, but you know
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:38.160]   Yep
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:41.920]   Oh, so do you want to tie that up to the people using um
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.800]   Amp to get around this
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.920]   Oh no really they're using amp to spam
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:53.280]   Because amp has a google.com address. Yeah. Oh no
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.280]   Because they're cashing things
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:58.880]   It was the stories of some of the the fishes are
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:05.680]   You know putting up their their ampsite marking that with amkettie cash in the google cdn and then sending that link to people
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:12.160]   But I can't find it now. Hang on
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.360]   I do I do jeff you'll be happy to know I turned on amp on my wordpress.com
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:25.120]   Yes, well, it was just a little plug in and I checked the box and it's fun. So it's there. Yeah, yeah, so so
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:29.360]   I want your your view on this so publishers have been begging
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.120]   Facebook and google's been pushing facebook to
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.200]   recognize
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:40.800]   The amp standard and facebook took a step that way today, but it strikes me as one way not the other way
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:44.160]   You can publish instant articles
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.880]   on facebook and then
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.880]   Hit buttons to have it go to
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.200]   amp and
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.440]   instant articles, but I think what people were asking for was kind of the opposite as well that
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.440]   instant articles
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.600]   Would be amp compliant. No
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:03.040]   No, I think well, it's basically around you look at it. So
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:08.800]   Facebook has a tool that lets you generate instant articles and now they're also generating amp pages
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.320]   Yes, so it's um, that's nice
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.840]   um
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.920]   So you're saying that they should also read amp pages and present those inside facebook
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:23.760]   Which I think what if you're already set up to make amp pages in your cms what you can do
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:25.040]   Right wordpress
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.280]   the example wordpress so
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:34.240]   He sets it up to automatically create amp, but that doesn't do them any good in terms of getting that in instant articles
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:38.640]   So you want it to be
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.560]   I see compliant for that way, right you want to both ways
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.720]   Well, you know, it's a nice thing facebook did i'm not denying that
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.280]   But I could imagine in Leo's exact case
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:51.040]   You wanted to go the other way as well. No, yeah, it makes sense
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.840]   I think part of it is that amp is slightly more general in this article
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:59.600]   So instant articles is you have to put these particular bits of mark up in and then we'll recognize it as an instant article
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.920]   Whereas amp is
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:07.600]   Here's you know amp is more if you put any of these up these bits of mark. I mean it isn't amp otherwise it is amp
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:10.480]   So
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:12.480]   So one is
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:19.920]   Amp has more functionality. I mean it's an articles has more available functionality than amp does
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:27.520]   Amp is a subset of both html and the sense is an article so that no, no, that's really true. So it's an instant articles
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.800]   As I recall it is
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:36.880]   Their own sort of subset of browser functionality that they will use to render it in their in the facebook style
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:44.480]   But you have to mark it up with a set of classes that says or a set of elements even so you have to have a certain set of elements in it
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:47.680]   Otherwise you wouldn't recognize as an instant article it will fail the validator
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:54.800]   Uh good news, uh Austin uber and lifter coming back
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:01.280]   Monday, and I just got a coupon from from fasten telling me to uh to use it which was the
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.360]   competitor that started up. Oh wow. I just got two minutes ago. Oh, I did too look at you
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:10.160]   Share my code save your friends
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:16.240]   Uh, so yeah, this will be interesting to play out. This I'm the state overruled Austin's
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.960]   I'm so pissed off about that. So
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.720]   For a variety of reasons not necessarily related to uber
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:25.360]   Um that in the sanctuary cities
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:28.080]   legislation as before
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:30.080]   Um to cause the brawl in the capital
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.160]   um
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.160]   Yeah
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:40.640]   I went down to the state house when that last time I was in Austin they have a big statue on the way down there
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.600]   uh celebrating states rights
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:51.200]   Which of course is as you know is is code for slavery and uh, and I'm just thinking well
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:53.200]   Maybe they should have city rights too
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:59.200]   You know what the time our our governor at the time of our decision to secede
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.280]   Was from caneticate and he actually did not want to succeed
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:09.120]   So he actually left the governorship of texas over the issue of succession
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:10.080]   Wow
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.640]   Fun fact I learned because I went on a duck tour this weekend
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.640]   A duck tour
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:18.480]   Yes, oh you rode the little Austin duck buses that go in the water
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.120]   Would you have family visiting?
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:26.480]   No, no, my daughter had never done one and I I love duck tours. I do them in every city. I go to the house when really you're
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:30.080]   Really? You're a duck tour consort?
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.540]   If that's the thing.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:35.200]   What do you think you like about them that they go from the land into the water?
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.460]   No. I like cracking it people. (Laughter.)
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.940]   I'm a very enthusiastic Quacker. (Laughter.)
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:44.720]   Wait a minute. When you're on a duck tour, they give you a duck call and I encourage you to quack.
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:48.240]   Oh, yeah, my duck collar's downstairs. But yeah, you go.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.200]   (Quack quack)
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:53.440]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.540]   (Laughter)
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:57.260]   You have a duck collar?
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.460]   It's not like a...
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:03.460]   No, it's not a real duck collar like a hunter would use. It's a...
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:06.060]   Google this. It's a... (Laughter.)
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:11.400]   We chased... I just want to say in San Francisco, we chased the ducks out of San Francisco.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:17.600]   Oh, I believe it. So, yeah, all these people have these little duck-billed things that you just quack.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.080]   I'm sure eventually you'll see a picture of people doing a hunter thing.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:24.920]   I was hoping for a Stacey Bird Call show.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.040]   No.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:26.880]   Oh, sorry.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:30.920]   But if I had my Quack or I would be enthusiastically quacking right now, there they are.
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.680]   Oh, my God. I have never ridden a duck tour.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.560]   Oh, is that a argin?
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.560]   Oh, you guys are just feeling like you're too cool.
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:44.520]   These are super fun and it is on a land.
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:45.880]   And you just...
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:47.720]   These tourist days...
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.800]   I didn't really... You got a little duck thing. That's hysterical.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.440]   Austin Duck Adventures is a fun, narrated tour that goes all around the great city of Austin.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:01.360]   It's the perfect day outing for adults, kids, seniors, really anyone.
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.360]   I don't want to see the duck...
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:06.560]   You're going to have a 75-minute tour that goes all the way around downtown Austin.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.200]   Your tour guide is going to show you all the great places that we go in love,
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:12.440]   such as the Capitol, the Driscoll, you're going to go by the Captain's Day.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:14.080]   Slavery statue.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.520]   And then everybody's favorite part, you're going to take a splash into Lake Austin.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.680]   It's great you're going to go all the way around the lake.
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.320]   We're going to see the whole country.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.320]   These are powered by biodiesel too.
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.600]   Yes.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:26.120]   It's great.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:26.320]   It's great.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:26.480]   It's great.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:26.680]   It's great.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.120]   It's great.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:27.120]   It's great.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:27.640]   It's great.
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.160]   It's great.
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:28.640]   It's great.
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.160]   It's great.
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:30.160]   It's great.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:30.160]   It's great.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.160]   It's great.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:31.160]   It's great.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.160]   It's great.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:33.160]   It's great.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.160]   It's great.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:35.160]   It's great.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:36.160]   It's great.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.640]   Do you see the property of East Hatchery that's still up in Austin?
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:38.640]   Oh, Lord. All right.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:46.640]   I didn't realize this was correct.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:49.640]   There's a hippo.
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:53.640]   I'm trying to urge one of those here.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:59:01.760]   Speaking of Uber, Eric Holder's report is supposedly coming this week.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:09.320]   Former Attorney General was hired by Uber to figure out what the hell is going on there.
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:11.440]   So that'll be interesting.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:19.040]   And Uber has fired Corey Levandowski, the engineer that was the center of controversy.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.040]   I'm sorry, Anthony Levandowski.
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:23.680]   Yeah, I was going to say Corey Levandowski's never worked for the White House.
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:26.240]   Never worked for Uber.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:28.560]   Although that would have been pretty funny.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.920]   Anthony Levandowski, no relation.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:31.920]   Or is he?
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.920]   Maybe he is.
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.920]   We don't know.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:34.920]   He's a Lewandowski.
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:35.920]   It's the same name.
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:37.080]   That's a no one's sign.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.840]   I think the Uber culture of the White House were pretty well together.
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:46.400]   So he was the engineer that they hired from Waymo.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.520]   And actually he quit Google to start Auto, which is a truck company, then Uber bought
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:52.120]   Auto.
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:59.080]   And supposedly these very top secret Waymo Lidar technology he stole from Google and
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:01.080]   brought it over with him.
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:05.320]   And of course there's a big court case, Google sued.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:07.320]   Uber has agreed to pay 600.
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.760]   Well, no, no, that's not.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:10.760]   They haven't agreed to anything.
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:13.960]   But Levandowski was ordered to hand over evidence.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:17.920]   He asserted his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:19.200]   He was continued to refuse.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:24.280]   So even though the court can't do anything, Uber has fired him.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:25.720]   So Fifth Amendment doesn't work.
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:28.000]   Just a little tip.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.160]   And employment matters.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.160]   Can't plead the Fifth.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.080]   Well, you can.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:44.520]   But I refuse to hand over any employment information on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.720]   It's kind of like the people who argue free speech when they get fired for saying something
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.720]   reprehensible.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:49.720]   So there you go.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:53.240]   It wasn't particularly there either.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.960]   Anything else I've missed?
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:55.960]   Oh, OK.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:56.960]   We're there.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:57.960]   Oh, we're there.
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.160]   Believe it or not, we're towards the end of the day.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:01.160]   Oh, my.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.160]   The program.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:03.160]   Yeah.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:05.520]   Something was that there's so much good stuff.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:08.760]   This is this is a full the first.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:11.720]   Oh, there was Mary Mieker's 2017 Internet.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.920]   Yes, that'll take us a year.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.360]   That is a lot of slides.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.360]   Sorry.
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.360]   I can do it next week.
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:21.360]   I can do a whole show on her trend report.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.560]   They say she did say that.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.760]   Is there is there good stuff in here?
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:29.600]   Ten million Amazon echoes have been sold according to her.
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:30.600]   Wow.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.600]   Wow.
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.600]   That's a lot.
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.200]   That's according to her.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:39.640]   She's a Kleiner Perkins and she does this yearly slide deck this year.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:42.520]   355 slides.
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.720]   And everybody looks at this because she's I guess she's pretty perceptive.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.720]   Right?
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:48.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:50.720]   And she has a great team of researchers gathering data.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:57.280]   It's basically sort of pre pre verified facts for you to use in your presentations for
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.280]   next year.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:01.800]   And also approved by KP.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.800]   So if you're going to pitch them, you could say, well, Mary Mieker slide says.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.800]   According to the Mary Mieker.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:07.440]   This is this big.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:09.080]   Does she it's her internet transport?
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:10.080]   She's done it for some years.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:12.160]   Does she do this?
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:13.160]   What is the point?
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.160]   Does she do this?
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:19.920]   She she started it at Morgan Stanley and she was the analyst who I think it was Morgan Stanley.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:26.120]   She was the analyst who way back in like 2000 or 1999 was like the Internet.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.480]   It's going to be big.
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:30.760]   And a lot of companies are going to put money in it, but only a few big companies are going
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:31.760]   to last.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:35.680]   And then she accurately pinpointed like PayPal and Amazon and a couple others.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:41.400]   So ever since Oracle, she's a profit profits.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.400]   I was going to call her Cassandra, but she is actually not a Cassandra.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:45.800]   No, that's the wrong kind.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:50.760]   She's a she's the one that inhales natural gas.
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.760]   She's like, that's that.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.760]   Ap Ethiopia.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:57.000]   No, the Oracle of Delphi Delphi.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]   She's more like the court astronomer astrologer.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.880]   Yeah, that's a little closer actually.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:02.960]   Yeah, she she kills the sheep.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.360]   She reads the entrails global smartphone growth is slowing.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.800]   Smart phone shipments through 3% last year.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:12.000]   This is not new.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.360]   This is what we're talking about.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.440]   Sorry, this is no big slow.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.280]   It's like, you know, no big slow.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.280]   No, I don't know.
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.280]   No.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:22.520]   Once half of people have something, it never doubles again.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:24.240]   Well, of course, it's called math.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.240]   Yeah, this is where we're with cell phones.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:30.040]   We've kind of crossed the point where the growth can continue at the same rate because
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:31.960]   you're running out of people's own to.
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:35.720]   And Leo can only like bug the trend by having 50.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:37.440]   So for so long.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:39.040]   Right.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.480]   Voice is beginning to replace typing in online queries.
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:46.960]   20% of mobile queries made by voice in 2016.
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.200]   Accuracy is now about 95% unless you use Siri.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.720]   Google has shared those stats.
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:56.480]   Like, not this IO, but last Google.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.520]   In 10 years, Netflix went from zero to more than 30% of home entertainment revenue in
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.240]   the US while TV viewership continues to decline.
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:06.240]   What?
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.240]   What?
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.240]   Give me that to me again.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.240]   Netflix went from in 10 years.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:12.280]   30% of home entertainment revenue goes to Netflix.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.480]   That seems like a lot, doesn't it?
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.480]   With when there was HBO on the news.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:17.320]   I think she means subscription revenue.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.480]   Well, they have more subscribers than HBO.
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.040]   But a lot of people aren't cable lost.
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:23.360]   I actually just got an email.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:28.360]   It was like 890,000 people subscriptions in the last.
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.360]   Here we go.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.400]   Major pay TV providers lost about 795,000 subscribers.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.000]   Oh, this is from March even.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.200]   I bet I have a more recent one.
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:39.400]   There's like 100,000,000 TV homes though.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:40.880]   I mean, it's.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.880]   I know, but they've been.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.880]   That does.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:43.880]   You know what?
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:45.600]   Thank you for actually using your brain, Jeff.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.600]   That does the number.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:48.720]   It does seem a little wrong.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.880]   Maybe they summarize it wrong.
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:50.880]   I'll bet they summarize it wrong.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:51.880]   I bet you that's right.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:52.880]   This is.
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:54.720]   If we get only find that slide.
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:55.720]   So that would take us.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:00.600]   If you don't have the PDF, you can grep it, can't you?
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:02.240]   I am not greping, Mary Meeker.
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:04.240]   I'm sorry.
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.240]   Greping?
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:08.920]   I just don't want.
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:09.920]   I don't want to know.
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.080]   I'm not even going to Google it.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.320]   It stands for General Regular Expression Parser, as I remember.
[02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:16.320]   Oh, God.
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.320]   And it's called Search.
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.120]   And more nor.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.240]   Unless code friendly households.
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:25.040]   That's definitely Stacey's.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:26.040]   That's mine.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:27.240]   My family just got home.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:28.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:31.040]   I can get a Quacker up here if you need one.
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.320]   You don't need any.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.080]   You don't need any cameras down there.
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.080]   You got the door.
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.080]   Try to find the percentage here.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.080]   Hang on.
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:40.080]   OK.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:41.080]   I can't get the slide deck open.
[02:05:41.080 --> 02:05:42.080]   Monthly minutes.
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.080]   Oh, just just down the PDF.
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:47.760]   That works better than trying to use the crappy, better thing.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:49.720]   Network TV minutes delivered.
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:51.720]   Network Netflix slides.
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:56.080]   It's like-- and I bet she goes through them.
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:57.560]   There's 300 some of them.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:59.960]   I bet she goes through them like one per every three seconds.
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:00.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:01.960]   So it's like--
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.280]   Well, let me tell you about Global Smite Show and your
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.280]   SuperZigas are in the middle of it.
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.600]   And now let's talk about Smite Throne installed base.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.680]   And now let's talk about internet usage engagement.
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:12.160]   Solid growth plus 4% year over year, mobile three hours.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.160]   Good lord.
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.240]   Yeah, so I'm searching for Netflix to try and find this figure.
[02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:16.240]   OK, we go.
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.760]   Extremeing from the percent to greater than 30% of home
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:21.920]   and 10 revenue in 10 years, USA.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.480]   So it wasn't this part.
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:24.960]   And yes.
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:27.800]   What slide number is that, Kevin?
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.320]   I don't know.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.240]   I'm on the PDF.
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:35.080]   How do I tell?
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:36.440]   I have 100 slides.
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:38.120]   I have a 52.
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:39.080]   OK, I have a 62.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:40.080]   I have a 62.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:40.440]   I have a 62.
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:41.440]   OK.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.440]   That's only--
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:44.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:49.320]   I feel so informed.
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.040]   Can you absorb this?
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:51.400]   This is--
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.680]   This is command F Netflix, yeah.
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:53.960]   Yeah, there we go.
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:56.680]   Netflix-- I need to grip it.
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:57.960]   Netflix streaming--
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:04.640]   share represented by Netflix's domestic streaming revenue
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:06.280]   over total home entertainment revenue in the USA.
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:08.240]   Domestic streaming not broken out as a individual segment.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:09.560]   I still don't believe it.
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:12.080]   Netflix streaming's on a different graph.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.600]   Only show streaming subs thereafter.
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:16.600]   OK, hang on.
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.960]   Netflix paid subscribers is that solid green line.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:25.480]   Paid subscribers.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.080]   Oh, I hate these double--
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:27.920]   It's on the left.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:28.480]   That's--
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:28.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:30.240]   --a million.
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:31.160]   So it's on the right--
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:32.560]   And then share USA home revenue.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:36.720]   Yeah, this is like-- oh my god, this is nuts.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.880]   OK, so--
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:39.800]   It's a bad graphic.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:42.880]   She's got to go to Edward Tufte's seminar
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:45.960]   and work on this.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:46.560]   But you know what?
[02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.520]   I'm sure what she says.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:49.240]   I haven't never watched her speak.
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:51.080]   I'm sure what she does is she says, well,
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.840]   let me tell you what this slide means in a few words.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:54.840]   I would hope.
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.760]   You'll see the video from code from her.
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:00.520]   But I mean, Netflix is-- for our RTV,
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:03.680]   we buy-- if I don't count Amazon Prime
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:07.520]   because I get that with my $99 Prime thing,
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.280]   Netflix is the only thing.
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:12.640]   And sometimes on months that we use Hulu,
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:16.360]   we re-up our Hulu, but that's it.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:17.680]   So--
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:19.720]   This actually is-- it's really fun to read this,
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.640]   but it just set aside a day.
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:26.440]   Facebook platform, monthly active users,
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.560]   global months since launch, the green line--
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.200]   I can-- I can tell I straight this.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:37.560]   The fast-growing green line is Facebook.
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.720]   The red line is Instagram.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:40.320]   I don't know, actually.
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.680]   You can't really tell anything from this.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.840]   I don't know what it--
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:43.840]   It's all going up, man.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.520]   It's all going up.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.200]   Up and to the right.
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:47.480]   This is what all the graphs are up and to the right.
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:48.880]   Up and to the right.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:49.880]   General--
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:50.680]   That's what that-- Oh, here's good.
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.840]   Generational media usage.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.240]   The chasm is increasing.
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:57.160]   That's really true.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:01.560]   The shift to internet delivered content is increasing.
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:04.800]   Mobile device time per day has doubled over the last two
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.320]   years.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:08.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:10.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:13.600]   Here's the traditional cable conundrum.
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:17.280]   Channels plus consumer prices plus programming costs
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:22.000]   are rising, but subscribers are falling.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.840]   That's a traditional cable conundrum.
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:26.360]   There's the-- there's on things you can add up.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:31.880]   I've been writing about that since 2009.
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.960]   Those are not-- I think we need some type checking,
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.200]   some type checking here.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.040]   This is not-- those are not.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:39.000]   Crowd Justice.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.120]   Do you know about Crowd Justice?
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.160]   This is big in the UK.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:44.000]   It's a Kickstarter for court cases.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.120]   It's coming to the US.
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:46.600]   Wow.
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:47.800]   Oh, hang on.
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:48.600]   Is this a different one?
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:49.400]   Is this--
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:51.600]   This isn't the guy who was solving the parketies.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.080]   Is this another one?
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:54.000]   No, no, this is a different one.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.440]   Users have taken cases to the Supreme Court in Britain
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:57.600]   and won them all.
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:00.680]   It was used to raise funds to battle gerrymandering
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:03.120]   and Trump's travel ban in the United States.
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.920]   They just raised $2 million in--
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.200]   but that's not much--
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:09.960]   and a round led by Ben Rock at First Drive Capital
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.040]   for moving into the US.
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:16.960]   It's like, go fund me for court cases.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.320]   So it's not actual class action.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.400]   So the US has class actions, which UK doesn't.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.200]   Which is the lawyers decide to put you in a class
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.040]   and fight for you and then keep most of the money.
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:27.320]   Right.
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:31.600]   This is individuals saying, help me fight, you know,
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:32.280]   like--
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:32.780]   OK.
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:36.120]   Like Mike Hallot, who's known as Pirate Joe.
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:39.480]   Pirate Joe is being sued by Trader Joe's.
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:42.000]   He made a business of buying Trader Joe products in bulk
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000]   and reselling them in Canada.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.400]   Or Mike Masnick.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:46.880]   Oh.
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.280]   That could help.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.040]   Yeah, that'd be good.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.400]   Mike Masnick, who's fighting the fight against that guy who
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.100]   claims to have invented email 20 years after it was actually
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:54.160]   invented.
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.240]   Oh, don't get in the middle of that one.
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:57.600]   Now, is I careful, Leo?
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:59.040]   I didn't say his name.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.760]   You and Mike soon might have a class.
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.280]   I know, really.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.000]   I'm really excited about this.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.120]   I spent many hours on CompuServe playing something
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:11.800]   called Colossal Cave Adventure.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:12.800]   Yes.
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:13.720]   Yes, sort of.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:14.280]   Yeah.
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.600]   Originally Crowther and Woods Adventure.
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:22.120]   I think this is the 651 point version, if you know what I mean.
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:26.200]   And I mean, I was taking a phone and plunging it
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:31.920]   into rubber cups on a 300-baud modem to play this thing.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:36.160]   You are at the end of a road before a small brick building
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:37.800]   around you is a forest.
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.840]   A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.680]   If you played Zork, you played a derivative of this.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.480]   But this was originally--
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:51.040]   it was originally about 1976 in Fortran, I believe.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:51.560]   Oh, Eric.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.040]   I started playing at 81.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:57.600]   Eric Raymond, open source God, uploaded the game's code
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.360]   to GitLab.
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.960]   This is awesome.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:02.760]   Oh my god.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:04.480]   This is so extensive.
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:08.200]   This is a forward port of Crowther Woods Adventure 2.5
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:11.440]   from 1995.
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.440]   Wow.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:19.000]   What is-- oh, it's written in C. Here's the readme.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.760]   The authors have given permission and encouragement
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.080]   for this release.
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.280]   Oh, there's a history file, too.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:30.360]   I've got a little compiling to do, maybe a little grepin.
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.280]   I might do some grepin before I do some compiling.
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:35.800]   Oh, man.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:36.920]   I'm trying to read it.
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.800]   I think my first thing was when I was a kid,
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.480]   sitting in my dad's lap, as he played,
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.000]   is it Wizard in the Princess, maybe?
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:42.440]   Oh, wow.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:43.920]   It was like one of those.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:47.080]   So and I started playing that with him way
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.920]   when as a really small kid, once I could read.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.720]   That makes me feel very old, Stacey.
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:52.560]   Thank you very much.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.480]   Here is, by the way--
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:54.440]   I'm sorry.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.720]   One more stat from Mary-Meker.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.680]   Last year, 60% of the most highly valued tech companies
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.360]   were founded by first or second generation immigrants
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:08.480]   and employ 1 and 1/2 million Americans,
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.920]   including Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook.
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:14.600]   OK.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.360]   Immigrants, we get the job done.
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:21.600]   Actually, I'm a Mayflower descendant, so I can't say that.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:24.320]   Oh, I guess we're immigrants, too.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.480]   A long time ago.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:27.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:29.640]   I was the first generation immigrant until I left.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.400]   Yeah, you were.
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:31.800]   That's right.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:33.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:36.400]   I really do think we have now covered the board.
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:39.800]   Everything of interest.
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.320]   Uh-huh.
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:44.400]   Elon Musk might quit the advisory board.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:48.240]   He has tweeted that if he drops out of the Paris--
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:48.800]   what?
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:51.240]   Oh, you were going to get by without that one, right?
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:52.240]   Oh, no.
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:53.880]   I was like, Jeff, I'm getting hungry.
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:56.040]   Oh, Jeff, don't bring up anymore.
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.160]   Things are going to start happening.
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:13:58.640]   She's getting faint.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:13:59.960]   She's getting faint.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:00.560]   This is--
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:01.760]   You're feeling very cool, Fairer.
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:03.480]   --for the Paris Accords.
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.440]   Let's take a break, and then you can do a pick,
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:06.640]   and then you can go eat.
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.680]   What's for dinner tonight, Stacey?
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:10.000]   Oh, you guys are not going to like it.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.840]   It's a Kaling quinoa salad.
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:16.240]   Oh, you need Blue Apron, my friend.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.840]   There's a segue.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:20.880]   You need to go to Blue Apron.com/Tweig
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.920]   and get your first three meals free.
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.680]   That's what you need.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:27.120]   I am having a delicious Blue Apron meal tonight.
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:29.480]   I think it's blackened pork.
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:30.600]   I love Blue Apron.
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:34.240]   So the idea of Blue Apron is the number one fresh ingredient
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:36.880]   and recipe delivery service in the country.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.400]   What you do-- it's not a subscription.
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:41.920]   You go on the site, and you pick your meals.
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:44.760]   This is the two-person plan for great for couples.
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:46.800]   Or you know who would work for you, Andrew,
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:47.840]   and your daughter, Stacey?
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:48.880]   Because we do that.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.240]   Michael, we split it three ways, and there's usually enough.
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:52.960]   Oh, and so-- Oh, man.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:53.920]   It's so many.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:54.400]   Yeah.
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.200]   It's so good.
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:58.480]   Caramelized onion grilled cheese sandwiches.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:00.520]   Oh, this looks so good.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:03.920]   With the summer squash and celery salsa.
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.000]   Thing is, you're going to make some stuff you've made before.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.160]   I can make grilled cheese sandwiches,
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.960]   but did you ever try it with melty,
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:13.440]   Fontina and caramelized vadelia onions?
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.320]   Maybe not.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:16.520]   Persian-style chicken and crispy rice.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:19.760]   I love the international flavors.
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:22.400]   I've learned so many great new ingredients.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.320]   They send you everything you need,
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:28.280]   including the meat, the fish, fresh, never frozen,
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.160]   and exactly what you need.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:31.400]   In fact, I'll show you this recipe.
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:32.800]   This is what you get.
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:34.400]   You get a half cup of jasmine rice,
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.120]   a half cup of Greek yogurt, a pink lemon.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:38.280]   No, what's a pink lemon?
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:39.120]   That sounds good.
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:40.760]   Summer squash, yellow onion.
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:43.520]   You get just two tablespoons of butter, not more.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:44.480]   So there's no waste.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:46.040]   You have exactly what you need.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:50.800]   The recipe comes with pictures
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:55.800]   on a really nice eight and a half by 11 card that's sealed.
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.880]   So you can follow along, do it yourself.
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:00.720]   You'll feel great.
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:03.640]   40 minutes later, you've made an amazing meal for yourself
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:05.440]   or your family or your loved one.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:09.200]   And you've done it at a great and much lower cost.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:12.840]   In fact, grocery stores cost about 60% more than Blue Apron
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:15.400]   because they don't have all the overhead of a grocery store.
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:16.640]   What's on the family menu?
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:18.400]   And you have all the spoilage.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.320]   Right, there's no, right.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:22.800]   This is always all the stuff you buy bigger things.
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:25.240]   I made a pumpkin chiffon pie
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:29.320]   when I was trying to woo young women early on in my days.
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.960]   And it cost me like $25 'cause I had to buy peppers.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.120]   Right, right.
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:33.960]   I had to buy everything.
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.040]   Right.
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:35.880]   You don't do that with me.
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:37.400]   You didn't have pepper?
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:38.600]   All right, that was not the case.
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.000]   The first time my wife was unimpressed with my discovery
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.120]   that kitchen cabinets were the exact right size
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:46.720]   to store New York Times's.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.280]   Oh Lord, you're kidding.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:50.640]   Oh my God.
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:52.000]   Go ahead, be all I do.
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.680]   Sorry, no, I just.
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.480]   You finger newspaper in the cupboard?
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:57.920]   Oh my God.
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:00.880]   How about chicken schnitzel with fingerling potato salad
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:03.040]   and marinated Napa cabbage?
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.040]   This is the family plants, Greek spinach and feta cheese pies.
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:09.600]   Oh, you think those?
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.960]   Yes.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:12.760]   It's those, wow.
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:14.920]   It's like their take on spanna cupada,
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.440]   which I love.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:19.800]   And look, yeah, you get everything you need to make it.
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:21.040]   Oh, I love this.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:22.040]   Oh.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:22.880]   Oh.
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:27.320]   This is, this is, Blue Apron is so awesome.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:28.680]   Look, we're gonna, here's what we're gonna do for you.
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:30.760]   We're gonna get you your first three meals free
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:31.880]   and free shipping.
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:33.080]   And remember, it's not a subscription,
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:34.000]   so there's no commitment.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.560]   You can just try it.
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:39.000]   If I go to Blue Apron.com/Twig.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.600]   Blue Apron.com/Twig.
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:44.600]   I love it when I, in fact, I saw,
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:46.680]   Lisa has our Blue Apron box in her office.
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:48.280]   I saw it came today.
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:50.280]   I love it when we get the new Blue Apron.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:52.040]   You know what we've been doing, which is really nice,
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:54.720]   is we, she gets three recipes too.
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:55.680]   She knows we're gonna want,
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:58.880]   and one, she wants to give to her parents.
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:01.040]   So her parents, yeah, it's really sweet.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.400]   Her parents live in town,
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:05.040]   and we just bring it over there, and they love it.
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.240]   And they, you know, her mom cooks it up and it's delicious.
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:10.200]   Blue Apron, it'd be a great gift for somebody.
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:12.400]   Blue Apron.com/Twig.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.440]   Thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:20.240]   Why don't we let Stacy get out of here?
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.520]   You gotta, you gotta thing this week, Stacy.
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:25.120]   I'm sorry, guys, I'm like,
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:26.720]   why and why, and then here's Kevin.
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:27.560]   Like it's--
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:28.720]   I know you're hungry.
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:30.320]   Good night. It's okay.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:32.520]   I know you're hungry.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.360]   I'm a whiter.
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:35.040]   Okay, so mine is really easy.
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:36.880]   I don't have a thing this week,
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:39.400]   'cause I was busy breaking, breaking doorbells.
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.160]   But I do have, and it totally relates to our conversation,
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:45.680]   I have a great newsletter for you guys
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:50.680]   if you were interested in digital privacy and digital rights.
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.640]   This is from my former colleague,
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:55.720]   both at Fortune and at Gigahome, David Mayer.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:58.040]   He is based out of Germany.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.200]   It's a weekly newsletter.
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.000]   It's called Connected Rights.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.000]   Oh, this is great.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:02.840]   Oh, I have to--
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:03.680]   Yes.
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:04.520]   Oh, this is awesome.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.480]   You can stick it in your spam newsletter file, Leo,
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.320]   along with mine.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:09.160]   I know.
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.160]   This is--
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:12.400]   It's a good summary.
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:13.920]   It might make you angry.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:15.400]   It's quick.
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:18.000]   So I love it.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.080]   I like it.
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:20.520]   Maybe you will too.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:21.600]   Very nice.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:23.960]   And how can you find it?
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:25.480]   Just Google Connected Rights, I guess.
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:26.680]   It's a collected rights newsletter.
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:28.320]   I put a link in.
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.480]   Let's see if connected rights--
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:31.480]   It's a long, weird link.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.680]   It's not a great pretty link.
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:33.680]   It is.
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:34.520]   No, it's--
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:37.240]   He's @Superglaze on Twitter.
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:39.000]   So let's see.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.680]   Let's find a good link.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:43.480]   Yeah, it's like EEP URL.
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:44.480]   You know what?
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:45.480]   Just-- I'm telling you.
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:46.480]   Google--
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:47.920]   Just-- he's got @Connected Rights.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:48.920]   OK.
[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:49.920]   On Twitter.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:50.920]   There you go.
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:51.920]   There you go.
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:52.920]   OK.
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:53.920]   Very nice.
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:54.920]   We'll just subscribe to the feed.
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:55.920]   Let's see if that shows up.
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.920]   Yeah.
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:57.920]   There you go.
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:19:58.920]   So useful.
[02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:03.200]   Kevin is got some indie web stuff for us, I'm sure.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:04.200]   Of course.
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:06.160]   Of course.
[02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:08.720]   There are 20 spots left at the indie web summit.
[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:11.760]   So if you got a 2017.indeweb.org, you can sign up there.
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:16.320]   This is in Portland June 24th, the 25th.
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:19.840]   And I probably won't be there, but a lot of people I know and like will be, and I'll
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:23.520]   be watching it over the internet because you can do that too.
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:28.800]   So if you can't actually make it important at the end of the month and next month.
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:31.240]   That's awesome.
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:32.880]   Look at all the names in the indie web.
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:36.440]   Tontec and Aaron and Ben word molar.
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:37.440]   They're all there.
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:38.440]   You've been a small.
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:39.440]   It's already.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:40.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:41.440]   I love them all.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:42.440]   I love the indie web.
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:47.760]   I'm all I'm all in on the indie web.
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.800]   And I've got a kind of fun thing for you.
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:51.040]   OK.
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:54.600]   So this is RoboVision, imagery.partnonsoftware.com.
[02:20:54.600 --> 02:21:00.240]   You've got to give it a picture and it will it will feed it to three different image recognition
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:02.080]   thingies and decide what they are.
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:09.320]   So give it a photograph of something that you would like to say.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:12.160]   There's a picture of Jeff Jarvis.
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:20.720]   Facial hair, person hair, book, text, human, people.
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:21.800]   Still recognizing.
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.880]   I have hair.
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.360]   There's a third one hanging on this coming in, but it's slower.
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:31.680]   So Google and then I don't know what a recognition with a K, but it's German probably.
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:39.040]   So Cloud site sees man in black and purple collared laser.
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:40.320]   Collared blazer collared.
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:45.120]   So I'm fairly sure Cloud site is actually somebody typing stuff in that they see.
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:47.120]   Oh, that's why it takes so long.
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:50.800]   So they obviously don't know the difference between collared and collared.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:52.880]   They're just they're a bad speller.
[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:53.880]   They're a bad speller.
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:54.880]   That's really interesting.
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.880]   Yeah, that kind of they gave away their humanity.
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:58.480]   They gave away the humanity that.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:21:59.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.480]   Yeah.
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:03.800]   So go go vision and imagery.parthenonsoftware.com.
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.800]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.960]   Jeff, we already did meekers numbers.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.960]   Right.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:09.960]   I was just there.
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:12.960]   I was going to do a Swiss man as opposed to a Florida man.
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:14.520]   A Swiss man was fine.
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:22.040]   We've lost in court 4,000 francs, $4,100 for liking the Famitori posts on Facebook.
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:23.040]   What?
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:24.040]   Liking them.
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.040]   No, no.
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:28.880]   That was a crazy story.
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:33.360]   But since we adjusted the spelling joke, we should probably also do the Google trends
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:34.360]   here.
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:38.360]   The most America's most misspelled words.
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.040]   That is my most misspelled word.
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:41.800]   I totally fit the profile in Texas.
[02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:42.800]   In Texas, maintenance.
[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:43.800]   Misspelled.
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.640]   I can never spell maintenance.
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:49.200]   But how come Jersey can't spell 12?
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:50.200]   12.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.040]   Oh, what about the 12?
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:54.480]   Or angel?
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:57.640]   So this I this is by the way, one of the greatest features of Google and the one I
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:01.400]   you probably use the most is if I can't spell a word, I just type it into Google and it's
[02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:02.960]   said, did you mean beautiful?
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:04.240]   Because you spell it.
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:06.840]   Be oh, oh.
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:08.280]   What is this that?
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:10.920]   What is this Arizona can't spell?
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:12.160]   I can't read it.
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.160]   Banana?
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:14.160]   Looks like banana.
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:16.520]   Arizona, you can't spell banana.
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:19.600]   Oh, that's New Mexico.
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:21.240]   Arizona can't spell tomorrow.
[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:22.240]   That's true.
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:23.240]   I know that.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:28.720]   Of course, the script's national spelling bee is now underway, so you should practice
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:29.720]   your spelling.
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:32.320]   I like the main is pneumonia.
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:37.000]   So I think is it Washington state also pneumonia?
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.120]   Oh, here's a better quality map here.
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:41.000]   Here we go.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.800]   This is much better quality.
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:45.560]   Like who can't spell quote?
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:48.120]   Quote quote.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:49.600]   Some of these I just are baffling.
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:54.800]   It's interesting that both Oklahoma, Oklahoma can't spell patient.
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.800]   Is that Oklahoma?
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:57.800]   I wish they put the names of the states on Oklahoma.
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:59.640]   Yes, that is.
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:03.120]   That is what state is that they can't spell Chihuahua.
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:05.080]   Is that Georgia?
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.080]   No.
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:12.240]   And by the way, in Vermont, they can't spell diarrhea.
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:13.240]   It's funny.
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:14.240]   The main can't spell.
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:16.560]   Maine and Vermont, there's something related there.
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:19.280]   And in New Hampshire, they can't spell Europe.
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:25.760]   That's the biggest sauerkraut.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:27.200]   This is fun.
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:30.200]   Hallelujah is a problem in several states, of course.
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:33.640]   Pneumonia is a problem in several states as well.
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:38.160]   In Florida versus gray, Alabama, I can, that's okay.
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:41.280]   Gray versus gray is a problem.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:43.320]   How can you not spell gray?
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:45.480]   Well, there's G.R.E.Y. and G.R.E.
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:50.880]   Do you think they spell it G.R.E.Y. and Alabama, really?
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.880]   Is that the problem?
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:52.880]   Ooh.
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:53.880]   I'm suspicious.
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:58.520]   Of course, it's a good thing I'm not in South Dakota because they can't spell that.
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:00.520]   No, that's not South Dakota.
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:01.520]   What is that?
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:02.520]   Montana?
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:03.520]   What is it?
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:04.520]   Nebraska.
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:06.600]   What do you win the state?
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:09.440]   Name the state contest, Carson, in eighth grade.
[02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:10.440]   Geography.
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.960]   Geography, I hate it.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:14.800]   Whenever it's geography on jeopardy, I just go, I'm done.
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:15.800]   I'm out of here.
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:16.800]   Wait a second.
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:17.800]   Wisconsin can't spell Wisconsin.
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:21.680]   Everybody's been mocking Wisconsin all day.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:23.680]   Can't spell Wisconsin.
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:24.680]   OMG.
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:34.000]   Ladies, gentlemen, I think this is a great time to end this hootenanny.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.280]   I heard Stacy's stomach rumbling.
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:37.720]   Stacy's stomach is rumbling.
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:39.320]   Either that or her dog is barking.
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:40.320]   They sound the same.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.120]   No, she's quiet behind me.
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:43.120]   IOTpodcast.com.
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:44.120]   Yes.
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:45.960]   That's just sweetie.
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:49.920]   Get on down there and enjoy that fine quinoa and kale salad.
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:51.920]   It's delicious.
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:52.920]   It sounds great.
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:53.920]   It sounds very healthy.
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:55.920]   You can just come back from McDonald's.
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:56.920]   Is that where they were?
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:25:58.800]   No, this is my daughter's favorite.
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:01.720]   My 10-year-old daughter's favorite meal is the Cale and Key Moss out.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.840]   Now, what do you dress it with?
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:09.400]   It's like a Caesar salad with dressing with lots of garlic and you massage it.
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:13.960]   You have to with the kale because kale will be tough if you don't massage it.
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:17.680]   Do you use Valerie Burton Ellie's recipe?
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:20.240]   I use something from the internet.
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:26.120]   Oh, no, I use eating well massage kale or massage kale salad.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.880]   Massage kale salad from eating well.
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:31.880]   Wow, that sounds great.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.600]   They got so legal in three states.
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:34.600]   You have to massage kale.
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:36.400]   It's tough otherwise.
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:39.600]   I just think that that's a reasonable thing.
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:40.600]   There it is.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:46.360]   It's like a Caesar salad with kale.
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:49.720]   I'm making it tonight that looks fabulous.
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:50.720]   You're right.
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:51.720]   It's still.
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:52.880]   quinoa is great in anything.
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:53.880]   It's great in salads.
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:54.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.360]   It picks up the flavor of the dressing.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.120]   It gives it protein which is nice.
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.360]   Add the apples.
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:03.200]   You add some dried cranberries and everyone's happy.
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:06.200]   I'm clicking the heart to save this recipe.
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:07.200]   See?
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:09.200]   Kevin Marks stayed up late in Yorkshire.
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.200]   If you wait a little.
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:12.200]   If you don't.
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:16.440]   I was going to say you'll hear the hound of the Baskerville's howling on the board.
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:18.720]   If you don't go to bed soon.
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:20.200]   That's that's that's don't know.
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:21.200]   Dart more, of course.
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.200]   Oh, hello.
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:23.200]   Hello.
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:24.200]   Hello.
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:25.200]   Hello, Poodle.
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:29.160]   Oh, she's been patiently waiting, but she needs to get fed soon.
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:32.160]   Is this this this is called Fifi?
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:34.400]   Is that what you said?
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:35.400]   Phoebe.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.640]   Phoebe on on.
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:41.640]   That was terrible.
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:45.920]   You named your Poodle after the Secretary General of the United Nations.
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:46.920]   What?
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:47.920]   All right.
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:48.920]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:49.920]   Appreciate you're coming by.
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:50.920]   Go feed, Phoebe.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:51.920]   Phoebe.
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:52.920]   Phoebe.
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:53.920]   Phoebe.
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.560]   Phoodle should be named Phoebe, I think.
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:57.560]   I'm just going to say.
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:58.560]   Yes, I think so.
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:27:59.560]   I think it's a law.
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.560]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:03.640]   He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:04.840]   That's why he's all dressed up.
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:07.160]   Because he's a professor.
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:11.560]   Also an author of many great volumes including Gutenberg, The Geek, Public Parts, What Would
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:17.080]   Google Do and GeekSparingGiftSpudgmachine.com as his blog.
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:18.080]   Thank you all.
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:19.680]   All said, Stacy, what are the...
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.680]   Are you?
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:21.680]   Yes.
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.680]   I can actually buy it.
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:23.680]   No, no, no, no.
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:24.680]   I'll sell it too.
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:25.680]   I just...
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:26.680]   Is public parts?
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:27.680]   Mm-hmm.
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:28.680]   That's actually a good book.
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:30.920]   That's a very good book about these very issues.
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:33.920]   It's like, what about his other books, Leo?
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:36.800]   I like what would Google do?
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:37.800]   I love them all.
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:39.160]   That's how we let it here, I think.
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.160]   I think so.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:41.160]   Yeah, that's a great book.
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:43.160]   We're Leo, I've been trying to say goodbye five times.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:44.160]   I don't want to say goodbye.
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:45.400]   I'm having too much fun.
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:47.160]   We'll hang up first.
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:48.840]   We do this week at Google.
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:50.880]   You can all hang up now because this is just all business.
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:51.880]   I'm going to do it to business.
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:53.760]   It's business time.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.480]   We do this week at Google every Wednesday, 1.30pm Pacific, 4.30 Eastern.

[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:34.560]   I will not be here for the next couple of weeks.
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:41.240]   I think Jason Hales is filling in off on vacation to the great Inca.
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:44.640]   Well, it turns out it was kind of disappointing.
[02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:49.520]   Hiram Bingham who found it in 1911 thought it was the lost city of the Incas.
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:54.360]   It turned out it was just a rich Inca summer home.
[02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:56.560]   But it is up there in the Andes.
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:57.560]   It's quite beautiful.
[02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:00.280]   600-year-old ruins, Machu Picchu.
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:05.320]   And then I will be coming down from the mountaintop and going into the ocean and visiting the Galapagos
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:06.320]   Islands.
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:10.400]   And I will be back in three weeks today.
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:11.400]   Thank you everybody.
[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:13.080]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
