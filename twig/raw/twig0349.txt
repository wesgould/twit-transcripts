[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   Oh I get it all the news stories that I that I couldn't do on Mac break weekly or Windows weekly we just we slide them down to this week in Google so it's Facebook this Google the cloud
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   you know European Commission whatever we can't fit in anywhere else but this makes it fun and of course Jeff Jarvis is the leader of the pack he is joining us today from Germany so no video from Jeff we think the audio will be okay
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   and it is late at night there and I think the latency is about 20 seconds so I'm a little worried I'm a little worried but we'll do our best Jeff by the way is a new Devorak the first about three years of Twit Devorak was always the one coming in on some sort of bad line there was one entire
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   Twit where we couldn't hear him so he would type in the messenger you could try this Jeff and then I would read his responses on Google messenger also with us from search engine land.com Danny Sullivan always a pleasure thanks for joining us from the Balboa Peninsula which sounds exotic
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   indeed indeed but it's not it's San Diego basically yeah well no Orange County Orange County yeah between San Diego Los Angeles the forgotten city Midway
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   Midway area yeah and yes ladies and gentlemen Mike Elgin is on the road but I'm so pleased to welcome him back to our microphones as they used to say in the radio days he where are you these days
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   the Yucatan Peninsula we're all in a peninsula today you're the Petaluma Peninsula I'm not yeah I'm in the valley the Petaluma Valley but hey the Yucatan I'm in Cancun Mexico so you're on the east coast of Mexico that's right after a jaunt through Cuba
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   spend a month in Cuba so jealous that was really something I tell you you know stranger to Cuba you'd stayed there before it had wonderful stories to tell was his first of all had it changed much
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   it's changed massively actually the the internet is a major factor that is completely changing in Cuba now even though only a minority of people can get on it there these public Wi-Fi hotspots you know it's communist party supplied Wi-Fi hotspots have existed for a year now when I went in 2008 there were probably three or four Wi-Fi hotspots in the entire country and they were all tourist hotels in Havana
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   and that's what I use back then to get online and do my work and so on nowadays there's something like 60 Wi-Fi hotspots in the country they're slow super expensive and sometimes hard to find in some of the some of the other cities around the country there's literally one Wi-Fi hotspot in the entire city
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   so that's hard to imagine a modern country without ubiquitous internet they use it as a as a means of control for now the government is really concerned about rapid reorientation of the country to the global stage so they've slowly liberalized they've let people travel abroad but this whole internet thing is something that's very scary now the way that they do it now part of it is a source of revenue for the government
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   it costs about two dollars and 19 cents per hour to use the Wi-Fi we spent about three hundred dollars on Wi-Fi in the month that we're there but more importantly to the government when you buy these Wi-Fi cards that give you either one or five hours online you have to show your ID they log exactly who you are associated with exactly what card so when you use this Wi-Fi everything that I do they know that it's Mike Elgin
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   oh he was in this connection so it's it's a source of intimidation and control that they don't want to give up so they don't let restaurants they don't let nightclubs or coffee shops or private homes have internet connectivity for the most part some high level government people can have
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   dial up broadband but other than that they want to know they want to know that every single person exactly what they're doing online that's you know it's almost hard to believe that it's that's worse than China
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   it's far worse than China and of course it is censored internet people think you know Cuba has always been a tourist destination it's a beautiful island with amazing beaches and beautiful people amazing music it's a wonderful place to visit on vacation
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   and this gives Cuba kind of halo effect that makes people not realize what a totalitarian communist dictatorship it is in fact we try to stay outside of the tourist bubble we lived in regular apartments we shopped in regular stores
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   and it's a brutal place to live for Cubans this is why so many of them are still trying to leave even with the liberalization it's a very very tough place nothing works the infrastructure is crumbling we talk to some Canadian friends there who did and all you can
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   know it all inclusive resort package in one of these high end resorts in Veradera they charge exactly as much as you charge at any other country and yet they didn't have water for four days they didn't we were in an apartment where the water went out in the apartment
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   and the only way we restored water is the Airbnb host that was renting to us paid somebody to bring a truck and fill this is turns for the whole building and that was the only way he get us water the rest of the people in the building were very grateful for that
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   Cuba is a mess because of the restrictive government they have two currencies people are incredibly poor and they have food rationing and so on it's a very very very tough place to live and they definitely need Google they need the Internet
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   and I'm afraid that it may be a while before they really actually get online in any sort of meaningful way it's such an eye opener you know we you know people say first we're world problems and stuff but you really don't really appreciate that what that means
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   until you hear stories like this you know when we're all worried about all Google's watching what I do on the Internet and that's nothing compared to what people in Cuba are putting up with how much of their poverty and suffering those
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   because of sanctions from the US.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   Most of their problems are about the US control the international banking system and so they can't raise money very easily but my sense is that the vast majority of their economic problems are the result of the fact that most businesses are owned by the government.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   There's no choice there's no competition government bureaucracies are notoriously inefficient you go to the store and it's not like oh should I buy this kind of cooking oil or should I buy Western oil or should I buy Crisco or should I buy this that thing no you go there
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   and it's this is the one brand you have and it's a brand that's owned by the government almost everything is owned by the government and so any country that has tried to run the entire economy has ended up being extremely poor now Cuba is very lucky in two ways in terms of their economic situation.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   They have 3.5 million tourists now coming to the island dropping like we spent $4,000 in four weeks.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   Which is a good deal but for Cuba that must be a ton of money right.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   It's a ton of money I mean and they also Cuba also essentially takes money that is earned by the public for example we know one person who worked for another government I won't specify the government because I don't want to get any money.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   I don't want to get anywhere near identifying this person was but he worked for a Western government in an office inside of Atlanta and he was paid and I don't know some regular salary probably $2,500 a month.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   The Cuban government takes all that and then pays him $30 a month.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   That's how it works.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   They just take money for everything. The Cuban government, Nichols and Dimes, every single thing they can get.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   For example if you take a bus across the country in Cuba as all the tourists do it's one of the best ways to get around.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   They have bathrooms in the bus they're Korean buses and they lock the buses and then they stop at these rest stops and they charge you up to a dollar something to use the bathroom.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   Little things like that they're always and that's you know of course that's going directly to the Castro administration.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   And so is Castro and his family getting rich? I mean what happens to all this money?
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   Well it's sort of backwards from the way things normally work.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   I don't think the Castro's claim that they live like ordinary Cubans I think for the most part that's mostly true.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   They're not living in Hasaram Hussein's Staupales' for sure.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   They don't seem to be living high on the hog.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   But the way things normally work is you have people have private businesses that make lots of money and then they're taxed.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   And governments get their money through taxation primarily.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   In Cuba there's no real taxation.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   They basically just take the money directly.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   And so in order to fund the whole government on a very small GDP I mean they don't produce much except for it.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   They produce much except sugar and rum and a few other things.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   And they have tourism and they have a lot of remittances from Cubans in the US just sending money to relatives.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   That's another source, a multi-billion dollar source of revenue for the country.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   They just have to take money wherever they can get it.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   It's a terrible system. It doesn't work.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   They're unable to keep up with the crumbling infrastructure.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   They can barely keep people fed.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   People are always on the brink of like you know hunger.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   Almost everybody.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   It's a fairly equitable system.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   It's especially comparable.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   This is every suffering equally.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   Everybody's suffering.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   I mean people are not actually starving but you go to the store and you know there'll be big shortages and outages of things here there and the other thing.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   And it's kind of like the old Soviet Union.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   If there's a line forming you get in it and you find out what they're selling.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   Later because if there's a line it must be good.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   You must need it.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   But you had this big surge in tourism was really interesting to see with Obama out there.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   And lots of people from all over the world including the US but also Europe and Canada all the usual suspects came rushing into Cuba.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   And they just don't have the market mechanisms to respond to demand.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   So there are all these stories about how Cuba was running out of beer.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   They're running out of water and they're running out of these simple things purely through distribution and manufacturing which in a capitalist economy there are all kinds of mechanisms to satisfy that demand.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   I mean you know Walmart has a super computer to predict when there would be rushes on water and they make sure they stock it early and all this stuff.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   None of that stuff exists.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   They just run out of stuff.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   And so they even ran out of Wi-Fi cards.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   There's a couple of days right after Obama's visit where you couldn't use the internet because you couldn't buy the cards.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   It's not because they had a lack of capacity with the Wi-Fi.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   They physically didn't get the cards to the places that sold the cards.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   Weird stuff like that you just would never think of.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   That is kind of shocking and it just shows you a sense.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   Even in a small island, relatively small island of centralized planned economy doesn't work.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   It's just fascinating.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   Do you think the removal of trade barriers is going to change things?
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   It sounds like they're still a long way to go.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   Yeah, I mean I don't think people quite understand how far behind Cuba really is.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   One of the things that Cuba is really excited about about the removal of trade barriers is that it's a very agricultural based economy.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   And they're still using tractors from the 40s and the 30s.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   I saw the pictures that you posted of Cuban transportation.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   It's a very good continuing series.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   One of the first things that was sort of liberalized was there is a company in the United States that can actually provide parts for these ancient tractors.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   And the Cubans are super excited about that.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   They can't even think about modern tractors.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   If you think about tractors, tractors are amazingly high-tech now.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   They're almost self-driving. They're incredibly computerized.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   They just want to fix the ones they've got.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   They've got to fix the ones from 1935 because it's broken and they need, you know.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   So they've got a long, long way to go.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   And this is one of the barriers in which Cuban government is well aware of is they have two currencies.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   There's a currency for locals and then there's a currency for tourists.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   I did not know that.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   Yeah, my wife calls the one for locals the people's peso.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   It's not what it's called, but it's fun to call them peepees.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   And sometimes we have those and we use those to buy things.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   And if you're a tourist, you use cukes, CUCs, and those are tied to the dollar and so on.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   But the average Cuban wage is between 15 and 30 dollars a month.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   A month, Leo.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   The economic disparity with the rest of the world is so out of whack.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   Well, and that puts a $2 Wi-Fi card into perspective.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   I mean, you're not going to buy that.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   Yep.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Yep.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   And so there's a dual economy now of people who have friends and relatives in the U.S.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   who can send them iPhones.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   And then there's people who couldn't imagine ever having an iPhone.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   And so it's got a long way to go.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   The government is aware that it's an unworkable problem and they're also aware that sort of they're
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   kept in power by this cult of personality around the Castro's.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   How Castro is in his 80s, Fidel Castro is in his 90s.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   That's not going to last too long.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   So they're struggling for solutions.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   They don't want to give up power, who does.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   And meanwhile, the Cuban people are champing at the bit to move forward and join the world
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   as a liberalized economy.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   And I think that theoretically, two of the achievements they talk about with the revolution
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   are the education system and the healthcare system.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   I can't speak directly about whether or not they have successfully done those things.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   But they seem to have a high literacy.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   They have 99% literacy, which is really great.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   That's amazing.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   They have a lot of people who speak English.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   So they have lots of engineers.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   So theoretically, in a capitalist world, the sort of the job is rushed to the low end of
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   the market where you have high education and low wages.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   So Cuba could become like this new Singapore or what China was a few years ago or something,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   potentially, if the government would just allow it.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   When you hear about this poverty and this desperate circumstances and then you read stories about
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   the lung cancer vaccine, for instance, that Cuba has had for years, you wonder how such
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   a thing could happen.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   And you really feel for the people.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   And I do hope that something can happen for them and make their lives better.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   What a tragedy.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   Yeah, and I do recommend that everybody visit Cuba if you can.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   It's going to change, but maybe not as fast as we thought.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   It's going to look like it is now.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   Yeah, but it's an interest.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   It was a really fascinating place to go because again, we really tried to live like Cuba.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   We lived in regular apartments.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   We shopped in regular stores.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   We made a lot of friends.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   We had a lot of candid conversations.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   One thing that's very different now.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   When we were in 2008, everybody scared the death to say anything to us.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   And now people are just openly criticized.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   Oh, interesting.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   Out loud.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   And so there's a lot of boldness.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   There's a sense that things are changing.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   And I think they are.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   Good.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   And I don't know if they were much better under Batista.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   I mean, he was pretty corrupt himself.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   And there were multiple revolutions in the 20th century.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   And the US invaded several times.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   It was not a great situation.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   There's just got to be a way for Cuba to have its independence to have a certain amount
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   of equality, but also, I mean, one of the shocking things.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   I mentioned before the show that I went to the Rolling Stones.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   The Rolling Stones came to Havana for the first time.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.680]   And I didn't realize this aspect of it, but everybody was talking about this because only
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.800]   a few years ago it was illegal to even listen to the Rolling Stones.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.280]   Popular music was literally illegal.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.000]   You could literally go to jail for having an album or a CD with music on it.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.880]   And that's a degree of repression that is just pretty outrageous.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   So this whole Rolling Stones event was just like, wow, it's a new world.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.160]   They were actual Cubans saying, from now on, we'll measure everything as being before
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.880]   or after the Rolling Stones.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.440]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   Wow.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.160]   Mike Elgin, who's just off a month in Cuba, he's now in Mexico in Cancun.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.600]   If you want to follow Mike's travels, he's back to the parapetetic Mike Elgin.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   We know and love.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.720]   If you want to follow his travels, of course, on Google+, you're still posting there.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.480]   And I know still a lot of them.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.080]   Is everything making it to Facebook as well?
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   Facebook and Twitter.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   And you have a blog now?
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.960]   I have a blog called BecomingNomad.com.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.560]   It's sort of a site about the digital nomad lifestyle.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:05.480]   And it's a combination of observations, tips, things I've learned, things I've gone through.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:13.760]   So it's more of a specific, narrow focus on the living abroad as a digital nomad for
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.480]   anybody who's interested in that sort of thing.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:22.600]   And I'm hoping that you will continue to be places with some internet so we can get you
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   on our shows.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   We missed having you.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   Although I...
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   I hope so too.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   I really, there's hot dogs.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   A staple, apparently, in Cuba.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.680]   In our first Airbnb, they came with breakfast and they were feeding us hot dogs every morning
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   for breakfast.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.720]   And it's kind of like, why we have an hot dogs every day?
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.280]   It's considered a legitimate meat or meat by a product.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   It's a gourmet treat.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   Are you kidding?
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.880]   You can put anything in it.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.880]   Look at the cars though.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.920]   And of course, while we think, oh, this is wonderful.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.520]   They're keeping these beautiful cars, these vintage cars alive.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.080]   This is what they have.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.080]   This is it.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.120]   We're going to take a break.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.840]   Danny, thank you for being patient while we caught up with Mike's travels around the world.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   Oh, still worries at all.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   Isn't it fascinating though?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   It's just...
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   I don't...
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   I'd like to go there.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.160]   I'm my wise British and we lived in Britain for 12 years and you would walk down the streets.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.360]   Especially in Britain, going on holiday or vacation, such a big industry that on the main
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.080]   street, there's always these tourism shops.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.600]   There's all these places you could go and there'd always be things like trips to Cuba.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.520]   And I'd always be like, what?
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.840]   I mean, because you couldn't go there if you're in the US and you would realize, wow, everybody
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.600]   else is going over there.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.000]   It's weird that we couldn't go to this island that was 90 miles next to us.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   So it's very exciting to see all this stuff that's happening.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.120]   I really didn't realize the depth of poverty and repression that was going on there.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.200]   I mean, it sounds almost as bad as North Korea.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.080]   It sounds really horrific.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.400]   And so I appreciate the update, Mike.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.040]   And we will get back to matters of the Internet.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:11.000]   It feels so shallow to talk about the kinds of things we normally talk about.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.720]   You know, whining about various minor inconveniences on the Internet when you hear about stories
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   like that.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   My wife, I didn't work yesterday.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.880]   Yeah, gosh darn it.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.480]   Can I get a good Wi-Fi signal in the gym?
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   The jacuzzi.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   The jacuzzi, Mr. Robot.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.720]   What was I supposed to do?
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.200]   Well, you know what it always impresses me is the spirit of humanity to even through such
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.720]   a horrible, I mean, the 50 years, 60 years, the human spirit survives.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:46.600]   And a beautiful people who have managed to survive in just very challenging circumstances.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   It kind of is encouraging.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.680]   And one last thing, Leo, on Cuba, if I may, on along those lines, the desire to have the
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.400]   Internet is so strong in Cuba that one of the ways they get it is on a thumb drive.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.280]   There's this type of business called the weekly packet.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.360]   You subscribe to it.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.920]   It costs a couple bucks a week.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.800]   And every week you get a new thumb drive.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   You give them the old thumb drive.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.960]   They give you the new one.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.680]   And on that thumb drive or Netflix movies, YouTube videos, there's a kind of Cuban Craigslist
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.240]   with listings on it.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.280]   There's just a mishmash of the kinds of things people will get on the Internet.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.920]   It's like a slow, offline Internet.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.880]   And it's very, very popular.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.600]   It's the main way that people get Internet content even if they don't have the Internet.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   Isn't that fascinating?
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.800]   A sneaker net.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   People want the Internet.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.640]   And you know, I don't blame them.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.640]   I don't blame them.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   What's up, Cards?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   It's very popular in Cuba.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640]   You're kidding.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   No.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.120]   You get it on the little thumb drive every week.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.480]   There's a new episode.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Wow.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.720]   What is it?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.360]   The weekly packet?
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   The weekly packet.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.400]   But who can afford it if it's that much?
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.960]   People are willing to pay it.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.440]   I mean, it's a valuable link to the outside world.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.320]   The eight bucks a month is like a 30-year income.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.720]   It's like, yeah, it's incredible.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.120]   It's a lot.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.680]   Our show is brought to you today by Headspace, Love Headspace.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.600]   And I use it daily.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   It's on my phone.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.880]   You can get it on an iPhone or an Android phone.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.800]   Your mind, you know, sometimes with the enemy is within, comes from within, fear and anger
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.320]   and stress and anxiety and waking up in the middle of the night.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.160]   It's hard to get through a night's sleep or a day, a busy day, but you don't have to
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   live this way.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.200]   Headspace starts with 10 minutes of guided meditation every day.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.760]   And this comes from the amazing Andy Puttycoma.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.040]   If you've not seen his, if you've not seen his TED talk, you've got to watch it.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.480]   He leads all the meditations.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.440]   And I hear Andy in my head now and it just, you know, if I get a little stressed, Andy
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.200]   just says something and it just calms me down in my head.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.480]   Headspace is meditation made simple.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.640]   There are also thousands of scientific studies that show the positive effects like improving
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.760]   focus, relationship harmony, literally decreasing anxiety and stress.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   I started doing it.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.520]   My physician said you have to manage the stress in your life.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.640]   That's going to kill you.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.240]   And this is a great solution there.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.640]   We can get you started with a 100% free, take 10 program, 10 meditation sessions.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.880]   That's all it takes.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.440]   Ten days of doing this and I think you'll immediately see benefits and understand why
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.960]   now 5 million people.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.160]   This is an amazing number.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.640]   Use Headspace on their computer, on their device, their tablet, their phone.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.600]   I pump it through my Amazon dot into my speakers and listen in the house.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.320]   It's just great.

[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:04.160]   Andy Puttycom is a nice voice to have in your head.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.520]   We should call the show the weekly packet, says W.D.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   Marpey.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.520]   He says, "You guys talk about so much."
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   I like that.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520]   Maybe we should rename it.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.760]   So this week in Google, the weekly packet.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.160]   There is a lot of Google news, particularly this morning, the news that the EU has finally
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.480]   ended their year-long investigation, their antitrust investigation, and charged, I don't
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.440]   know what this means, exactly, if they've charged them or whatever.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:37.880]   But Google has 12 weeks to respond to the statement of objections.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.960]   The commission says that with 90% market share, by the way, that's significantly more than
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.840]   here in the states, right?
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.720]   Danny, what is it in the state?
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.200]   60, 70%?
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.000]   For Google search market share?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.280]   And it's estimated to be around 60 to 70%.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.280]   Why is it 90%?
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.360]   In Europe.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.520]   Because Microsoft's not even trying.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.360]   I mean, they're literally not even trying.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.640]   If you go over there and you try to use a version of being, they usually don't have
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.080]   the latest features that have been added to it, or the country-specific stuff is not
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   even there.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:21.560]   And the French search engines that were supposed to get funding and challenge Google didn't.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:26.200]   And so it's just become de facto, because there's just no one really doing that.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.000]   With the exception of Russia, which is in the EU, of course, but that's really been
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   it.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.280]   They just wiped out the competition, and it was much harder for anybody to challenge.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:41.840]   Yahoo, which in the US was a counter to Google for a very long period of time, had been weaker
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.200]   in Europe as well.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   And each individual market's smaller, too, right?
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:53.480]   So you're going to fight it out in France or Germany or the UK and so on.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.600]   But this is how Microsoft is fighting it.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.240]   It's kind of because of Microsoft's prompting, right?
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.240]   Right.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.400]   Fear search is the complainer in this case, and fear search is a Microsoft lobbying organization
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.480]   that exists to take down Google in every way it costs and Oracle's involved and others.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.160]   Well, it was backed by Microsoft.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.920]   It was never entirely Microsoft, and actually Microsoft has pulled out a fear search now.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.400]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.040]   They're not, apparently, and I think it's not-
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.840]   Oh, their job is done.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.840]   Exactly.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.960]   I mean, there's no doubt that Microsoft helped make this happen.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   And in some ways, it's sort of like turnabout is fair play because in 2009, Google was really
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   hammering away.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.760]   And before that about Microsoft Internet Explorer, and you're so dominant on the mobile app,
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.160]   you're so dominant on the desktop that you shouldn't be able to let people choose what
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.680]   their browser is or their search.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   You know, and that's the reason why.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.280]   And I think it's still run to this day that in the EU, you know, a Windows computer will
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.440]   ask you to pick your search provider when you turn it on and it starts up.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.680]   And so- No, not your- Well, not only your search provider, your browser, because that
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   was the- Sorry, your browser.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.560]   Yeah, there's the browser- We call it the browser ballot, where they say which browser
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.960]   would you like to be your default?
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.520]   And that's over now.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   That just ended.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.120]   But right, but Google really pushed for that.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.600]   You know, Google was like, yeah, we need to have this because there's two dominant.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.240]   And so now Google is going to be taken up in part by the same kind of actions it took
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   against Microsoft.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.000]   Well, and also, I mean, if you want to mention Microsoft, this is very similar to the Department
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.640]   of Justice's suits against Microsoft in the late '90s, claiming the same thing.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.160]   Dominant market share used to promote a new market in the- in the- in the- the- it browser.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.800]   And that's exactly what the EU is saying is, because Google has market share of 90%, they
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.320]   are using their- their position in search to force people to use Google in the Android
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   operating system.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:55.000]   The Play Store accounts for 90% of apps downloaded on the Android devices.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.200]   So manufacturers have to, you know, for commercial reasons, pre-install the Play Store.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   And for that reason, Android users are less likely to use other stores.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.640]   So the- the- the commission- Although that's confusing, right?
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.280]   Because that's part of what- It's called success, if you ask me.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:20.680]   Well, they say it's 90% of Android devices, but are they talking about Android devices?
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.040]   Are they talking about Android open source project devices?
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.320]   And when they say Android, and that instance to say 90%, they're saying-
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.440]   They're saying- The licensed Android devices.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   Oh, really?
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   Oh, interesting.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.520]   No, they probably mean both, because you're not going to be a licensed Android device without
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.680]   having Google play on it.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   Right.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   It's part of the licensing process.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.280]   The commission seeks to ensure, they say, that manufacturers are free to choose which
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.680]   apps they pre-install on their devices.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.920]   Although, just as with Microsoft, consumer choice has always existed, but it's the tyranny
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.880]   of the default because Google searches the default, Google browsers the default.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:02.960]   Although- Although interestingly here, it's like, I could just go on a rant about this
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   whole thing- Go ahead.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   And around you.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.440]   Do it, Danny, do it.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:11.640]   So first of all, we have to start off like, there's no question Google is dominant in search,
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640]   all right?
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.280]   And so Google is vulnerable and has already had actions against it in search because it
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.920]   has such a dominance.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.000]   And you can do the arguments of like, well, other people do different things or whatever,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.720]   but it's widely accepted that when you have dominance in a particular market, if you
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.400]   have a monopoly, it's not necessarily illegal to have a monopoly, but it's that you may
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.800]   have special circumstances that you have to follow to ensure that there's competition.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.560]   So Google at 90% in search is already vulnerable in Europe that it needs to do special things.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   And certainly the EU ruled that when it came to regular search.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:51.360]   But then they start trying to go into, well, how can we try to somehow curtail them in search
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.680]   when it comes to Android?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:32:01.000]   And so they do this bizarre thing of saying, well, they have like 90% of the licensed mobile
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.520]   operating system market.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.520]   It's like, what?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.760]   Like 90%- They don't- You don't pay Google unless I missed it somewhere.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.040]   You don't pay Google a licensing fee.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.600]   Google doesn't make money directly off of you becoming an Android provider.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.920]   And anybody could be a licensing, but they provided Android and said, here's this platform.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   You want to use it.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   You can use it.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.560]   You want to actually call it Android as a trademark, then it's going to be licensed Android and
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.680]   you have to install this Google stuff.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.960]   But still, you don't have to do it.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.880]   You can go out and buy your own thing.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:39.200]   So this product that no one actually has to buy suddenly, they say, well, you have a monopoly
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.080]   of this free product that people use.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.600]   So now we want to restrict it more because manufacturers should be able to do what they
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   want, right?
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.200]   But Apple doesn't have any of these restrictions, right?
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.360]   There's no argument in here that says, well, Apple shouldn't be able to shove, watch on
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:02.160]   its device or shove, podcasts down your throat, or shove pages down your throat, or shove any
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.560]   of the other Apple crap it wants to on iOS that you cannot install.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.680]   Because apparently, if you're the manufacturer of a device, you can do whatever the hell you
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.840]   want.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:18.200]   But if you are this bizarre majority licensee of this third party thing that we don't even
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.320]   make money off of and nobody has to use it, but they decide to use it anyway because they're
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.800]   too lazy to build their signage in or whatever the hell you want to call it type of operating
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.040]   system and do it, well, then we're going to say, well, no, that's bad because pre-bundling
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.480]   is bad because manufacturers should be able to do what they want because manufacturers
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.520]   may want to shove their own crap down somebody's throat rather than yours crap down to the
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.320]   throat, even though they didn't build the things that we're going to do.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   But wait a minute.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.760]   And I agree with you, but I'm going to, but wait a minute because one of the things the
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:52.440]   commissioner is saying is that when you and consumers want it, pre-install Google's proprietary
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.800]   apps on your version of Android, as part of the license agreement, Google says you have
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:03.880]   to sign an anti fragmentation agreement and commit not to sell devices running on Android
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.280]   forks, you can't sell AOSP if you're going to sell a licensed version.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:17.360]   So Samsung can't do both a Google Play Store version and then one without like, by the
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.560]   way, Amazon does because they don't, they call it their anti fragmentation agreement.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.000]   And the EU says, well, that's proof that Google's forcing manufacturers into using its market
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.880]   share and demand from consumers into its proprietary corner.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   Right.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.440]   Which, you know, it's your, but you, but I agree with you because Google did the right thing,
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.760]   which is they made an open source operating system that anybody could use.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.000]   They offered like Google services as, as, you know, a come on, maybe they should drop
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.560]   this anti fragmentation agreement.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   I think that is kind of.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.160]   Well, there's, there's a lot of things that they could do.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:56.760]   I mean, I agree with you on the anti when they started doing that's because a lot of
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.400]   this is coming back to haunt Google for its own two phase talking on Android.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.280]   First, Android's open source and anybody can use it.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.840]   Then it turns out, androids is not open source.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.320]   Anybody can use it.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.080]   Android, if you want to call it Android means you have to do all this licensing stuff to
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.600]   get the Android trademark.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.640]   Otherwise you can't call it Android, which is why Apple stuff does not call it was why
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:26.280]   the Amazon devices don't call themselves Android because they're not Android.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.000]   You know, you know, Kindle is not is kind of was not Android under the surface.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.600]   We know that, but it's not Android and right.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   Right.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   Brandon.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600]   Right.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.600]   So they started doing this stuff where I was like, well, everybody should get together
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.120]   because open is always good because that's Google's go to thing whenever they're behind
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   on something.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   Well, we'll declare it open.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   But let me defend them.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.120]   It opens a better thing.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.400]   But then once they get the dominance in an area, open is no longer open anymore.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.800]   And now we're in this bizarre world where well, Android is open, but it's not open because
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.280]   we do this licensing, but you don't have to do it.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   You can do this stuff over here.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.520]   So on the one hand, they've confused it on the other hand.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.400]   You is coming back being just as confusing with the whole thing.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.000]   And, you know, and by the time this is all resolved, it'll be probably moot as it was
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   with Microsoft.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.440]   And you have this and then you have this stupid browser ballot for 10 more years.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.480]   It just confuses the hell out of people and serves no real purpose.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.880]   Well, I mean, that's exciting too.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.960]   Because let's just let's just jump ahead and talk about all right.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.880]   Let's say you come up with your solution and the solution, the main thing that they're
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.160]   pushing here is they don't like search being shoved down.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.880]   They don't like Google search being shoved through Android, right?
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.000]   That's been the main thing that they put in here.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.240]   So let's do a ballot box of search providers you have to have in the EU.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   Okay.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   You want that.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   But what's that?
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   What is the choice?
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   Bing.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.440]   Your choice will be Yahoo.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   Bing.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.600]   And then France, they want to want to mandate.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   That's right.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.040]   France has their own, don't they, Mike?
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   Their France wants to mandate in addition to alternatives to Google that you have a French
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   search engine.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.920]   In other news, there's a French search engine.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.920]   Well, it's not.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.640]   And the here's the thing is Google France did have a French search engine and it was
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.440]   called name that I can't remember.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.120]   But it was a homegrown search engine.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.320]   They ended up letting it sold to AOL.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.600]   I'll see if I can find the name with it from there.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.520]   So, but even if you do that search engine, there's an excellent chance that some of these
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.400]   other search engines will end up being powered by Google.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   Right.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Oh, it's still Google, right?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.000]   Is Dr. Google or is it a hodgepodge of other stuff?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Dr.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.480]   I think it's going to be.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   I think it's being actually.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   Oh, it's being.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.240]   But it's but a sanitize whatever it is, it's a sanitized version.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.400]   So there's no information about your searches fed back to the origin.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.120]   Because they don't have their own crawler yet.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.360]   They say they're working on one.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.400]   I think that's the thing when you start changing around search engine.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.600]   By the way, the French search engine, the French private search engine is quant.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.600]   And I think they actually do.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   That's right.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.680]   I think they actually do run their own crawling because they remember talking with one of
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.480]   the principles on it last year when it was out in France.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.280]   So but here's the real problem.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.240]   Nobody wants anything but Google because Google's the bet is better than all these alternatives.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   So the customers.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.640]   Especially in Europe.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.480]   European public loves Google more than any other public.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   That's why they have 90% market share.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480]   That's right.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.560]   I mean, it'll give some of these other providers a better chance and give them maybe the ability
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:30.920]   to actually make a serious go of it if they really wanted to because right now, why would
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   you?
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.040]   I mean, seriously, why would you think I'm going to try to compete with Google?
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.080]   Because to build up that kind of an infrastructure that you need to crawl the web as the core
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.160]   part of competing with them is difficult.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.280]   And then to try to capture the market share.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.120]   Like you need some degree of market share to go with it.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   Right.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   So this kind of thing could benefit some of those companies.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.360]   And it might not be bad.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.480]   I mean, it's nice to have competition in search.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.720]   It's nice to have Google feel like there's things that they need to be stepped up.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:05.760]   And so going back to the idea that there's a 90% thing, they probably could have just
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:11.800]   said enough that you have a 90% share and we're going to impose this on Android anyway.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   Right.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.400]   But when they come in with all this other bizarre stuff like, and of course, you're the dominant
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.000]   third party licensing provider and you're like, what?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.720]   You don't even need to do that.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.040]   And then your argument, it's just weird.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.560]   Here's quant by the way, you can use quant qwantt.com.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.000]   You can use in the United States.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.240]   They show you hot trends, Donald Trump, Elizabeth II, IHOP and Chrissy Teigen's bust line.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.200]   Let me let's search for something.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.800]   Let's search for, what should we search for?
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   Mike Elgin.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.560]   Let's see if they know about you.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.000]   Is that you Mike in the sailor suit?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.680]   That's a picture of my dad.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.800]   Where did they get that?
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   That's my dad.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.400]   But at least you know what?
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.360]   Did a good job.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.440]   It found a lot of Mike Elgin.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.400]   Your Food and Technology podcast, articles by Mike Elgin on computer world Facebook, LinkedIn.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   Pretty good job.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   That's switching.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   Huh?
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   I'm switching.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.840]   You're well known in France.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   Here's videos.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   Look at that.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   Oh, there's one.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.680]   Mostly twit stuff.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.920]   It's all twit stuff.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.200]   Well, you don't do videos, right?
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   Let's see.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.640]   Danny Sullivan.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.000]   I mean, I guess you could.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.200]   I mean, I just don't see a lot of people wanting to use Quat even in France probably,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.720]   right?
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.720]   There you are.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   Oh, of course, I found the race car driver.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.280]   But you're mixed in with the race car driver.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.520]   Just how does that anniversary?
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.520]   Did he really?
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.720]   Well, they had some F1.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.800]   I know this because people were congratulating me on Twitter.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.520]   You're kind of inextricably in twine now for the rest of your lives.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520]   I know.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.520]   I know.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.520]   I just look at what the EU did with cookies.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.560]   And I feel like that's a really good example of how all of this is really going to end
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.600]   up with something that makes no one happy, solves no problem.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:04.160]   There's nothing as enjoyable than every time I go to a website having to shut that
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.080]   damn window telling me this is cookie.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   What did they accomplish?
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   You really did a great job there.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   Good for you.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.440]   I mean, if people are listening and don't understand what we're talking about.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.080]   Meanwhile, when I'm watching Sky TV and I change the channel, Sky doesn't tell me every
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   time I go to a channel.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.000]   And by the way, we're monitoring everything you want.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.320]   And we'll use that for however we want.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   Right.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.560]   It's insane.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   If when you go to sites most, and now it is every site because if you want to do business
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.760]   in Europe, you have to do this, there's a big banner the first time you visit that says,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.920]   "Hey, we use cookies.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   Is that okay?
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920]   Yeah, that's okay.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   Click that."
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   It's just annoying.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.400]   It doesn't solve any problem.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.760]   Costs money to implement.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.200]   Because it feels like the EU is just hyper-conservative about anything.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.080]   Any sort of new business model, any sort of new thing, just like, "Wait a minute, wait
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   a minute.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   We can't have a new thing."
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.920]   I mean, to a very large extent, if you take a 10,000 foot view of Google's business model
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.000]   around Android, it's just a different business model.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.080]   Yes, we gain dominant market share by giving away this great operating system on all these
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.080]   phones.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.280]   And the business model is we get the manufacturers to bundle these apps.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.000]   People launch the apps and we move money from advertising.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.040]   That's just the business model.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.720]   They don't like that business model because it doesn't match or map against anything that
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.800]   is understood or well known.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.360]   It seems like a pretty straightforward business model.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.040]   The OEMs are in a position where they can choose alternatives.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:37.880]   My Samsung phone has prioritized the Samsung browser, not Chrome.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.120]   They do use Google as a search, but if they didn't, that would immediately change it anyway.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.000]   But the companies that do try to do innovative things with a signage and mod and all these
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.200]   other things with the exception of maybe Amazon, alternative user interfaces and so on, they're
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:00.160]   routinely rejected by the public who say, "We want Virgin, Vanilla, Android."
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.160]   That's what we want.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.480]   Well, no, but I mean the biggest selling Android device you have right now is from Samsung
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.640]   unless I'm off the mark outside of China.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   I'm sure it's the S7.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.200]   Outside of China, right?
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.080]   And there's no way that that's a pure device.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080]   It's full of crap.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.080]   It's full of crap.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.720]   It's number one in terms of the second biggest one, but in terms of a market share, it's
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   a tiny percentage.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   Right.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.680]   It's less, but Danny, it's less full of crap than ever.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.560]   In other words, they're feeling market pressure to tone down touch with.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.720]   My Verizon phone, my Verizon.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   That's Verizon.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   That's not Samsung.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   It doesn't.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   You know, it's like...
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.400]   I agree with you on that.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.960]   Verizon loads it up with crap.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.560]   Verizon iPhone does not have that crap on it.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.680]   No, well, Apple had some remarkable market clap that probably has dwindled somewhat.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   But...
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.640]   But I do think that...
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.760]   I do think it's very easy to be in the US and just go, "Oh, those Europeans are crazy.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.200]   They just hate all innovation."
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.600]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:04.480]   I do think that there are some serious concerns they have that Google's market share in search
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.200]   is much higher than in the US, right?
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.360]   There really is no alternative out there that people are using.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.280]   And that raises obvious concerns to begin with.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.080]   You have those concerns about anything that happens regardless when something's at, especially
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.240]   when it comes to how people seek information.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.640]   Well, that's true.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:30.040]   I mean, Facebook had to say, "Oh, despite what Mark Zuckerberg said at F8 against Donald
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   Trump, we're not going to try to throw the election."
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.280]   And the fact that they had to say that shows that people are aware of the clout that Facebook
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.120]   and Google, the dominant players have.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.040]   I think you have that.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   But I think you have that.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.880]   Well, how long before Facebook does decide that...
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.360]   It's been probably once Google.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   Right.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.800]   And the fact that Google is far less dominant in other regions, other countries, proved
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.680]   that if they wanted alternatives, they would choose those alternatives or free available.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.320]   Well, a lot of the European countries and people do want Google.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.080]   But I think that you actually have significant number of people in Europe.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:09.520]   I'm not saying the majority, but I think a significant number of people who have serious
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:14.240]   concerns about the only search tool that I have is this thing that I have concerns about
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   what's going on with my privacy and my tracking and it's tied into my phone and maybe I don't
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.000]   want to use Google, but how do I get to a good alternative to that?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.760]   Because I think the privacy concerns in the EU are much higher in public concerns.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.680]   And then I think you have to add on top of the fact that there's a political aspect to
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.960]   this, both among people and among the politicians that are reacting to it or leading it, which
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.000]   is Google's an American company.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.960]   And you've got this American company with this big huge dominance that's out there.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.880]   And do we like that?
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.880]   That is that good.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.800]   And I think if you flipped it around and if you were told that the largest search engine
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:56.480]   in America was owned by China and a Chinese company, you might have some people who would
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.720]   have concerns about it or being worried about it might be thinking, well, maybe there's
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.000]   other things we need to maybe need to address this and maybe we need to address it on the
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.360]   anti-trust ground type of things.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.800]   And then there's no doubt that there's going to be politicians that see this as a way for
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.440]   them to score.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.240]   They don't, you know, sorry, but you know, European politicians are any different than
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.160]   American politicians where sometimes they're doing stuff because they think it's the right
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   thing to do.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.240]   And sometimes they're doing stuff because it's the right thing for them to score a big
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.520]   victory in what they're doing.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.800]   So, you know, it's kind of messy, but you know, I don't think you can entirely dismiss what
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.240]   the EU is doing as it's just all ridiculous.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.320]   I think they've got some serious concerns, especially with some of these licensing agreements
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.040]   that Google ties into Android.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.080]   But I do think some of the other stuff and how they try to position it seem to be very
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.080]   laughable.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:50.240]   And I guess that's what concerns me the most is that do you really think it's an issue
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.440]   that manufacturers should be able to put whatever they want on their phones or is it
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:58.520]   really that your concern is that when manufacturers can't put what they want, that doesn't help
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.840]   users, which in turn sells competition.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.360]   And then if that's the concern, then really what you ought to be doing is addressing default
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.160]   installations on any device.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:13.080]   Like, I'd be cheering from the roof as the EU said right now, do you know what?
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.840]   Nobody who makes a cell phone can force you to have applications stay on that phone.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.600]   Oh, yeah, there you go.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.840]   The consumer has a right to uninstall and pick and choose and put whatever they want on it.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.120]   And moreover, you need to make it really clear when you tell somebody that you're going to
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.680]   set something as a default while you're doing it.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:35.200]   So if Apple wants to make sure that spotlight is by default going over to Bing, you understand
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   that.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.040]   And in addition to that, you understand that they're doing it because they're getting
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.640]   paid a crapload of money to make it happen.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.960]   That's one of the things I actually wrote to the FTC here in the US about three years
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   ago.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.720]   And it's like, I said, the formal ender saying, we have these deals in the US.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.520]   They happen that the consumers have no idea why they're happening and who's paying whom
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   for going on.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.520]   And maybe you ought to be looking at how that kind of disclosure happens, but they don't
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.520]   care.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   So.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   Excellent.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:07.560]   One of the dimensions that I think bears pointing out is that it feels oftentimes like
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.240]   the EU is always complaining about American tech companies.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.640]   But the reality is that it's mostly American tech companies complaining to the EU who then
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.400]   respond to those American companies by going after the other American companies.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.880]   That's mostly the dynamic in all of these stories.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.000]   It's just a pawn in your game.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.240]   Well, you know, there's some merit to what the EU says.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.680]   And I think Google's smartest thing Google could do at this point would be to respond
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.200]   to attempt to settle.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.440]   They have a few weeks to do so.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.360]   I think four months, three or four months to do that.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:48.000]   And of course, what their response has been that the UC Davis strategy is Danny Sullivan
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.400]   called it to release a bunch of news today.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.600]   So that would be buried in the Google search results.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.880]   But I mean, they might just decide to drag it out as long as they can because you say
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:03.320]   long you drag it out the more that by the time you get to a requirement in the settlement,
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.280]   the more it may not make any deal difference.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   Right.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.280]   Exactly.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   And what happened?
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.720]   By the way, we've lost Jeff Jarvis.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:19.040]   He had to bow out because the quality was connection in Germany was so bad that he couldn't
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.200]   weigh in.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.440]   He'd have to respond 30 seconds later.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.720]   And that wasn't going to work.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:32.400]   But I'm really glad we still have Mike in Mexico and Cancun and Danny Sullivan from Orange
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.400]   County.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   What's the story with the Google transparency report?
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.440]   Because yesterday when I went to the safe browsing site status and search for Google.com, it
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   said somewhat dangerous.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.640]   Now it's not dangerous.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.560]   Talk about transparency.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.040]   Did they just change their settings or was it mistake when they said they were somewhat
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.040]   dangerous?
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.360]   You know, Mike, yes, it was some kind of a glitch.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:00.440]   I mean, you remember once Google blocked, I think in Google's search results, they blocked
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   all Google or something.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:06.000]   You remember there was that period of time when suddenly everybody had to use Yahoo and
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.600]   they had this big spike off.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.040]   So, you know, let's just happen.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.040]   These things happen.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.840]   It must have been a little embarrassing.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.520]   I don't think they went through and deliberately said, oh, we're bad.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.520]   Just go change it.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.520]   We're not bad.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.520]   Let's.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.800]   I suspect that if there was something that was wrong, they figured out what it was and
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   then tried to fix it.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.200]   Well, and it does say some pages on this website.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:30.720]   Well, it's the actual site safety details don't appear to have changed.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.840]   Some pages on this website install malware and visitors computers.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.760]   That's because it's a search engine.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.800]   So you may search to sites that do that.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:45.040]   Some pages on this website redirect visitors to dangerous websites, including Google Groups.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.480]   Dangerous websites have been sending visitors to this website.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.120]   So people link to Google.com and that's considered a black mark.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:59.240]   So none of that has changed just the overall status, which is now not dangerous from somewhat
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.800]   dangerous.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.600]   So I think there's a little status.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Oh, they're not dangerous.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.880]   Yeah, not mostly harmless would be nice.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   It was 2009.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.800]   I've got the TechCrunch article.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.400]   We had one as well, but it was like Google flags.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.040]   Whole Internet is malware.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.920]   So it was not for a real search on whenever you searched on Google, every site on Google
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.240]   will say this may harm your computer.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.320]   And it really helped Yahoo that day.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.240]   They got a significant rise.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.520]   So yeah, stuff happened.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   And not far wrong.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:39.880]   I think the Internet is really much a malware haven.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:46.320]   I think we can move on to less controversial topics, new things.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.600]   Well, unless you want to say, if you want to talk about the article, why I won't live
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.160]   in Google alphabets tech utopia.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.680]   Because it doesn't exist, Joe.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.560]   And even if it did exist, you don't even know what would be in it.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.680]   And this is based on that weird article that the alphabet wants to build a city.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.600]   You felt like you should write a clickbait article anyway.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.440]   So this is clickbait based on clickbait.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.800]   Also, why will not live in heaven?
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   Next.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:23.680]   Although, to be honest, if Google alphabet did build a city, I would move into it in a
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.680]   heartbeat.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.680]   Right?
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.280]   Well, who wouldn't want to?
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   You know what?
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.880]   I bet that is they're like giving you a free house and everything.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.720]   You might be like, oh, I should have to go.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.160]   They would have high speed Internet.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.320]   It would have autonomous vehicles.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.960]   It would have green roofs.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.400]   This comes from the ads everywhere.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.560]   It would have well.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   Any kitchens.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.880]   There's a price to be paid.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.640]   Yeah, no kitchens because you're going to eat out every night.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.720]   This is this comes from the recode.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.040]   You say, Danny, that this recode article in the first place was clickbait.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.080]   No, no, that one's not.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.080]   Oh, OK.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.520]   That's a report like here's and that's actually a report off of the alphabet article, right?
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   Right.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.680]   So that's like here, they're planning to do this thing.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.200]   We don't really know much about it.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.720]   But to me, it's like, why I won't live in this thing?
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.480]   We barely know anything about.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:20.960]   So it all goes back to the exclusive piece and the information by Jessica Lesson.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:30.120]   But sidewalk labs is considering not a city, but a futuristic district project sidewalk.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.440]   I've been working with a hundred advisors on a plan for a standalone digital district,
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.600]   which would mark one of the most high profile attempts at a dedicated technology test bed.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.800]   Please Google if you're listening, I volunteer.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.040]   You got to have some old people.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:49.040]   Can't all be millennials living there.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.320]   He's got a slow traffic down by crossing the street at a snail's base.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.800]   I volunteer.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:59.960]   It's kind of the original intention of Epcot Center, which is one of the old videos of Walt
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.680]   Disney rolling out the vision.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.880]   What they ended up with was very different from what the intended to and partly because
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   Walt Disney died.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:13.400]   But last time I was at Epcot, I took a picture of the telephone booth of the future.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.920]   This is an alternative future that I think is not going to happen.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.360]   That's why it's so hard to predict the future because I think nobody would have predicted
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.840]   maybe somebody would have the descendants of the pocket computer and its ubiquity and
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   its total addictive nature.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.920]   I don't think anybody really knew that that was coming ten years ago, let alone.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.680]   I think Google should buy an existing town like Detroit.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   Why not?
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.240]   Yeah, put hyperloop transportation like flying...
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.400]   Elon needs to buy it with Google.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.880]   They did have that contest where some town renamed themselves Google or something.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   Yeah, but that was to get Google with fiber.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.120]   Yeah, it didn't work by the way.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   They didn't get it.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.520]   Do you think they named themselves back?
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.440]   I'm sure they can come up with a...
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.760]   I'm sure they can come up with a city to buy here or there.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.600]   Made in New York in our chat room is suggesting that Google's prototype community of tomorrow
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.200]   should be called Goopcot.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   Goopcot.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   I like that.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.200]   That's good.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.960]   I'm moving the goopcot.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.960]   What?
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.280]   Mike Elgin, he was living in the country of the past.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.560]   He's now moved to the Middle Ages in the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.520]   Where are you going after this?
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.760]   We're leaning toward Europe, France and the UK as boring and delicious as that sounds.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.680]   But yeah, we're not sure.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.360]   Right now, Cancun is actually a great place because it's up to the Caribbean, to South
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.440]   America.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:40.560]   We have a couple of trips planned coming back to the United States as well.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   Who knows?
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.560]   Could be just about anywhere.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.000]   We'll be here for at least a couple of months.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.200]   I'm so damn jealous.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   I'm just really...
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.880]   I'm happy for you because at least somebody gets to do that.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.920]   Well, so much more to talk about.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.840]   Let's take a break and come back with more than we can talk about.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.320]   Facebook's frustrating and useless chatbots.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.200]   I haven't talked to you about F8 and chatbots yet, Mike.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.120]   I'm curious what you take is and all of this.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.680]   Okay, I can't wait to tell you.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.840]   You'll wait to find out.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.240]   I showed you a brought to you by Auto-Matik.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   Love my automatic.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.400]   Got one right here.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.680]   See it turns out every car, not in Cuba, you can't use this in Cuba, but every car built
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:26.120]   since 1996 has a OBD or on-board diagnostic port right under the steering wheel.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.280]   It's open, it's available, it's not illegal to plug into it.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.080]   I think most of us just look at it and go, "Oh, that's for the technician when he's going
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.800]   to fix my car."
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.560]   But you know, it can be used for a lot more.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.480]   When you attach the automatic, suddenly you've got the quantified car.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:45.200]   This just plugs right into it and it integrates with so many things.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.600]   You get real-time performance data.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.840]   So the first thing you do is install the automatic app on your phone, Android or iOS.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.880]   It pairs via Bluetooth.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.400]   And now you're going to get all sorts of performance data.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.000]   You can actually look at the temperature of your engine as you're driving.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   You can get audio alert signaling that you've stepped on the gas too hard or you're breaking
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.360]   too hard or you're going too fast.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.600]   That helps you become a better driver, a more efficient driver too.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.920]   Their commute analyzer determines when you should leave for your destination and how
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.520]   you could save money by making your commute more efficient.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.720]   Seeing how much a drive to the store cost in gasoline is really great.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   And it's real-time.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:28.120]   It's based on where you got gas last and the amount of gas your engine's using is really
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.280]   accurate.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:33.680]   The dashboard web app provides granular information, lets you export trips and then you could
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   tie it into other things.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:40.440]   So I have it automatically for instance, if this than that, porting out my every trip
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.960]   to an ever-note notebook, keeping track of where I go and it has the map, it has the
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:49.120]   distance, it has information about how I drove a score associated with it.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.080]   It also works with the Amazon Echo.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   It's so cool.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.960]   You can ask the automatic, how much gas is in my tank?
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   Nest.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.280]   So it can turn the thermostat up when you're on your way home.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.320]   You are a mechanic so you can figure out what those lights mean on the dashboard.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:08.640]   It'll work with fresh books and expensive and concurs so you can keep track of business
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.440]   mileage automatically.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:16.280]   And if you have a teenager, this is the best thing you can get.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:20.240]   They have absolutely integrate to help your teenager be a better driver and help you keep
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.880]   track of what your teenager is doing in your car.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:28.200]   They've even got 24/7 crash response so you can feel secure knowing automatic is keeping
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.120]   you and your loved ones safe at all times on the road.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.640]   Apple watch a Pebble integration as well and none of this requires a monthly fee.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.040]   You just have to buy the automatic.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:49.920]   Normally that's $99.95 but we have a special offer code TWIT TWIT TWIT TWIT TWIT TWIT TWIT
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.380]   to save 20 percent of the regular purchase price.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.380]   I got two.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.940]   I got one for, uh, least one for me.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:00.780]   I love the automatic automatic .com slash twit.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:07.700]   And if you follow my chief twit bot on Twitter or on Telegram, that's how I give you the
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.700]   notifications.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.840]   When I pull up out front, you'll get a notification.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.200]   Leo has pulled up.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.280]   That's using if this than that and it automatically -- it -- it -- it knows when I've turned off
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.120]   my ignition within a certain area on the map and tweets for me and posts to the Telegram
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   bot.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.120]   I love that kind of thing.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.720]   The sky's the limit.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:29.040]   Automatic .com slash twit.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.040]   Mike Elgin is here.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.300]   He's visiting us again from his jaunts around the world, Danny Sullivan from Search Engine
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.040]   Land as well.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   Let's talk about F8.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.920]   Were you able to see any of the F8 conference, Mike, or read about it?
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   No way.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.640]   I'm not sure of it, but I read all about it when I got back.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.320]   You know, I was a huge cheerleader for bots when they first came out.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.600]   I was -- as you know, I think it was on this show maybe a month and a half ago that I recommended
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.960]   x.ai which is got the Amy bot that interacts via email and so on.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:07.840]   But what's bothering me about the whole bot hype thing is the degree to which it's being
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.240]   viewed as an alternative to apps.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:16.160]   These are frustrated because their app is hard to discover and even if people install
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   it, they forget about it.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:22.480]   It's hard to get -- make an app that's both discovered and sticky.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.040]   They're saying that bots are the solution because you don't have to install anything.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.040]   It's just there.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.360]   You just chat and so on.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:34.920]   The problem is that I think bots are going to be in aggregate far worse than apps.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.600]   Individually if you just look at the 1-800 flowers bot, you think, "Oh, I could order -- I just
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.840]   want to dozen roses sent to my mother on Mother's Day."
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.480]   That sounds like a good application for a bot.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:51.680]   What happens when all the florists are on and there are dozens of thousands of bots.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   How do you find them?
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.160]   How do you remember to use them?
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.920]   Everyone you use is now kind of sending you spam messages, right?
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:07.200]   The flawed logic behind the hype around bots is that, "Hey, everybody's doing messaging."
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.960]   So that's where the eyeballs are.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.200]   We'll just go to where the eyeballs are and then we'll succeed because that's where everybody
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200]   is.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.040]   That's flawed logic because people go to messaging because it's free of spam, because it's free
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.520]   of visuals and complexity and hype and marketing.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:30.080]   And once that starts being asserted on the chat platforms and the messaging apps, it's
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.280]   -- if users can't do anything about it, they'll just wander away to some other medium.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.920]   It'll ruin messaging as a friendly medium.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.720]   I just don't see how bots are going to -- it's essentially going back to a command line
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   interface.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.160]   You have to know the command to launch the really kind of bot.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   Well, there's buttons.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.920]   Spots have buttons so that you -- I mean, the buttons are going to be critical.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.320]   But I have to say, I had to see an in-bot on for a while and I turned it off.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.720]   It just was annoying.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.760]   There's a great article, kitty Natopolis writing in BuzzFeed.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.200]   Six things that definitely sucked about Facebook's new shopping bot.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.560]   She just wanted some shoes and it kept trying to upsell her.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.160]   She said it was kind of like that annoying salesperson who's saying, "Oh, you look great
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.720]   in this."
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.600]   She said, "I want sneakers under $100."
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:21.040]   It offered her $500 sneakers.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.240]   And it just -- I mean, it goes -- these are a bit more expensive at $120, but I think they're
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.040]   really great for summer.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.160]   It even said things like, "You know, I think this is really, really a great looking shoe."
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.800]   And she's saying, "Who?
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   I who?
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   A bot?
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   How do you know?
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800]   Do you have feet?"
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.680]   The whole thing is really annoying.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.440]   No customer reviews.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.720]   And if -- she says, "I asked the bot to tell me the customer rating for a pair of sunglasses
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.560]   they replied, 'They don't have reviews yet, but, quote, 'We hear good things.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560]   From whom?'
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   I might ask.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560]   "From whom?
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.640]   Your bot friends?"
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.000]   And furthermore, you have to enter your credit card.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.760]   It doesn't -- for, I guess, for reasonable reasons, it doesn't save your Facebook.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.720]   Even though Facebook knows all sorts of things, including if you've signed up for things like
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.480]   the Facebook Pay feature and messaging your credit card, they won't use it though.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.280]   So you have to -- this is a good interface.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.560]   Manually enter your credit card number into the messaging.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.640]   That's going to go well.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.600]   So I'm more positive, although first I have to say, Leo, that was such a good pitch.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.680]   I just ordered one of those automatic things.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.440]   And you're going to love it.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.440]   They're so cool.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440]   You're going on and I'm going, "That sounds fantastic."
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440]   Oh, it is.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440]   As.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.120]   Will they never -- will they never stop working?
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   Ask me.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   Thank you.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.680]   You were a great pitch.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   Thank you.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   Thank you very much.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   Stay tuned.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.760]   I'll have other things for you to buy later.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:52.160]   So on the bot thing, I was Mr. Dubius about this whole thing.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.880]   And I totally agree with Mike.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:02.320]   And I do feel that there's so much hype in this idea that the bots are going to replace
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.280]   apps is going to work just as well as the way that the apps replaced the web, which,
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.040]   of course, they didn't.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.680]   And in reality, I think that these are all layered.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.520]   Sometimes using the mobile web is going to make sense for you.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.880]   And you're going to continue to do it, and it's great.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.480]   And sometimes using an app is going to make sense.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.600]   And you're dealing with one person enough that you're like, "Yeah, for my gym, if I could
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.560]   book a training session or whatever, they've got a great app.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.800]   It's really easy.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.840]   I use that rather than try to call them or go online or whatever because the app is great.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.640]   So I'm going to use their app."
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:43.080]   But I think that the bots have a place and that there are things that they can do.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.760]   And I did my own article and it was like, "How I sent flowers to Mark Zuckerberg using
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.760]   a bot."
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   Wow, that's right.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   I was supposed to ask you about that.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   You did that during the speech.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   Well, I wasn't doing this, but I wish it was that kind of.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   I was at F8 afterwards.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.640]   I wanted to look at different things.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.560]   And I sat down and I thought, "All right, I've heard a lot about bots over the past four
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.160]   months or so, but I've never really kind of interacted with one because I don't use messaging
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.400]   much and there hasn't been that many of them.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.560]   So let me go try one of these things out."
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.760]   So for whatever reason, I started off with the flower bot.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.080]   This is 1-800-FLOWERS-1.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.280]   And I came away with the believer.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.960]   Like, that bot is so good that when Mother's Day comes around, I will use it to buy the
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.360]   flowers because it was actually a better experience than going to the website, which
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360]   I have done before.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.680]   It was very easy.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:35.520]   And one of the nicest things about it was, like, you can complain about putting in your
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.880]   credit card number, whatever.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.600]   But I needed to send the flowers and I couldn't remember the whole address.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.800]   And as I was going through, I thought, "Well, let me pretend this in flowers to Mark.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   Why not?"
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.240]   Because let's see how this whole thing works.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.040]   And so it was like, "Well, what's the address?"
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.320]   And I'm like, "Well, I know it's one hacker way, but I don't know the rest."
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.280]   I put that in and it's like, "Do you mean one-half away?"
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.920]   A part called "A point in 9-2," whatever, whatever, whatever.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.400]   And then it gave me a selection of flowers.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.320]   And as you'll see, if you've read my article, they weren't exactly what I was looking for.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.280]   I didn't really want to send them love and romance flowers.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.560]   But I found something that was like, "That works."
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.880]   And it's a good price range and there was enough selections for what I needed to do.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.160]   And it wasn't going to be anything that great if I'd gone to the website as well.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.840]   And it was like a five-minute process.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.880]   And because I wasn't on the web and even if it was on a mobile web or an app, you're
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.160]   still sometimes like, "Okay, I got to put it in here."
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.520]   And to entering my credit card number, it saved it.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.040]   It went through pretty straightforward, straightforward.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.040]   I was a believer.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:42.520]   And in fact, after I sent the flowers to Mark and then I wrote the article about, and I
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.760]   posted the article two minutes later, my wife was like, "Yeah, I like flowers."
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.120]   If you're sending them to Mark.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.120]   So I went back and I sent her flowers.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.120]   Actually, she's actually more than flowers.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.800]   But I did it again and I did it all from the chat bot and it worked great.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   And so like I said, Mother and Day were all around.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.520]   So I think that for certain instances, you might find that these things are useful.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.280]   Now, I'm totally with a lot of these things.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.760]   I went back and played with that same shopping app and it was like, "Yeah."
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.680]   It was a miserable experience.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680]   I mean, and it made me--
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.680]   I guess we have to acknowledge just as with any other technology.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.680]   It's early days.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.800]   And so it's a mixed bag, right?
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   Some things will work.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.360]   The Pancho-- I think we're--
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.000]   Pancho is so annoying.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.640]   And I think Facebook kind of sells a disservice because they really wanted to make this a
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   big announcement.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.920]   And when you go in and, you know, if you go into your phone and you're in messenger now
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:41.480]   and you start to do a search for stuff, it's offering these five chat bots, only one of
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.120]   which I found worked really well.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   CNN was terrible.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:48.200]   Pancho, hi Pancho, the weather bot is singularly annoying.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.800]   I mean, it's almost as if you pick-- so in fact, there's a great article.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.040]   This is in Gizmodo by Darren Orphan, which he does some screenshots.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.640]   If you don't want to turn on Pancho at how annoying Pancho can be, do I need a jacket?
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.640]   Yep, it's chilly.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   Sunglasses?
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.280]   Sorry, I was trying to charge my phone.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.280]   What do you try to say?
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:09.600]   When you turn on your phone and it's like, here's the weather.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.080]   You can see the weather, instead of getting this really annoying hipster--
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.960]   Your future's so bright, God, where shades?
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.080]   What about an umbrella?
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.160]   Excuse me?
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.080]   Do I need an umbrella?
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.040]   And then what's the weather like this weekend?
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.280]   Are you on a boat?
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.760]   Because I was not able to find any results for that location.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.640]   What's the weather like in Brooklyn this weekend?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.880]   He finally gave up and said, "I'll tell you where I am."
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.080]   Weather in Brooklyn, New York is 46 degrees and clear this weekend.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.920]   Excuse it, Moi?
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920]   Weekend.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.960]   Sorry, dizzed off for a second.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.960]   What were you saying?
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.560]   Like, you don't want that in your phone.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.160]   I got family members like that.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.480]   I don't need a sign up for a bot.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:55.800]   But this is the-- this points to the three things that are going to make bots amazing.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.840]   And unfortunately, these three things are five years away.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.000]   So the first thing is real artificial intelligence.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.760]   We have to get to the point where computers can understand random things like umbrella.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   Artificial stupidity.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.080]   He's asking me if I need to recommend an umbrella.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:19.240]   So you need real AI to manage not in each and in every individual bot, but a referee,
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.900]   sort of a platform that refries all the-- that manages all the stuff, it could be the chat
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:24.900]   app app.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:28.960]   Okay, the second thing is you need the app itself needs to have all the data.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.520]   It needs to know who my mother is.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.120]   It needs to know what everybody's addressed, like Amazon.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.440]   The kind of information Amazon has.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.240]   But doesn't Facebook already know that?
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.680]   Well, they should.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.400]   The third thing is that I think the real killer app of this is voice interaction.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.080]   So typing, messaging, I think is okay.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.520]   But we really just want to talk.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.560]   And if you can imagine the integration of Siri, Cortana, Alexa, and so on, as the manager
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:02.880]   of all these third party apps, bots, excuse me, and can intelligently choose those.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.240]   So let me give you a real-- the flowers example that Danny's talking about is one of the best
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.480]   current examples for how bots work.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.360]   But here's how it really works.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.480]   You talk to the bot, you talk to Siri or Cortana, and you say-- or Google now, and you say,
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.800]   "I want to send flowers to Mark Zuckerberg."
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.120]   And the bot should come back and say, "You know, I've noticed through your past purchase
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:32.080]   that you like organic foods and organic things, there is a small shop in Mark Zuckerberg's
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.760]   town that sells organic flowers.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.600]   It's only a couple of dollars more than the cheapest flowers around.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.360]   Would you like me-- would you like to consider flowers from that?
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   Yes, I would.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.160]   Okay, so here it is, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.280]   That kind of intelligence will make this amazing, life-changing.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.520]   But for now, we're going to be struggling against this stupidity of AI, the inability
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.080]   of it to know anything.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.880]   The data for all these products have not been keyed in and optimized for bots.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.200]   So the world is not ready for bots yet.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.800]   The AI is not ready for bots yet.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.840]   And I don't think the public is going to be thrilled with all this frustration.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.760]   So I think that for the next year, there's going to be a lot of-- I think bots will kind
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:19.080]   of unfortunately be a little bit of a laughing stock because people will have so many frustrating
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.040]   experiences like the ones that you talked about.
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.400]   Yeah, but it's early days yet.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.600]   And I think there's potential there.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.520]   I think we don't even really fully understand what bots are best for how they could be best
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.520]   used.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   And I think you're exactly right.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.760]   AI is nowhere near as good as it is.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:40.360]   And I finally got the Amazon Dot, which is the-- I'm a fan of the Echo, a big fan, own
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.720]   four of them.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.640]   But the Echo speaker is kind of mediocre.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.280]   And I would like to have the Echo be able to do things like play me music and read me
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.880]   at books in a way that sounds a little bit better.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.760]   So the Dot is a speakerless, almost.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.200]   It has a small function utility speaker.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.960]   But it's basically a speakerless version is the top of the Echo Cut-Off.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.200]   And I paired it to a Bluetooth speaker, which seemed to be the best way better than plugging
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.760]   it in hardwired because it didn't seem to wake it up all the time, things like that.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:18.000]   But Bluetooth, put the Echo near where I am, the speaker is playing loud.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   It's great.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.360]   It's always there, always available.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:26.760]   And when the Echo suddenly has full stereo sound, rich stereo sound, it's just remarkable.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.240]   And I really think that that is a platform that is.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.080]   And let's face it, that's a chatbot, essentially.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   It is.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.920]   And it's doing what I'm talking about.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.480]   They have what they call skills, third-party developers.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.280]   And Amazon was very aggressive with this.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.280]   Built these skills.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.920]   But it also has the problem that I was talking about, which is in order to use a specific
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.440]   skill, you have to have skill yourself.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.640]   You have to know, well, what's the command specifically that will enable that skill?
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.760]   It's a, for one or two skills, it's fine.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.120]   If you want to use a dozen or two dozen or three dozen of those skills that are available
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.760]   in Amazon Echo, it's like, you know, it's like, there's a lot of homework to do to figure
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.960]   out, remember how to do it.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.400]   It really needs to be smart enough.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.640]   Because I mean, I was going through to add some skills and they're like 10 pages of
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   different things.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   Oh, there's so much stuff.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.880]   We need to be smart enough to know that when I tell it something that it goes right and
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:26.080]   just finds the skill and runs the skill rather than do you want to install it?
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.880]   I think if I say Alexa fart, I need it to just immediately fart.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   Would you like?
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880]   Would you like to install the fart skills?
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   No.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.560]   And then tell you that the syntax is so from now on, you need to say it this way.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   That will happen.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.520]   But I don't want to do that.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.760]   That's going to be a real leap for it too.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.080]   Because I don't want to actually have to remember the syntax.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.760]   It should figure that stuff out.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.000]   Well, that's another failing of natural language right now.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   It's not very good.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.120]   Good article in Bloomberg, although unaccannably loaded with dancing jiffs.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   I wish this is the...
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120]   I mean, just...
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   Okay.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   Can we just talk about the layout on this?
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.320]   I don't know what they're trying to accomplish.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:09.720]   But this is everything but punch the monkey.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.280]   But it is in the...
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280]   Did somebody...
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.280]   I don't know.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.000]   Did somebody get a GIF animating program at Bloomberg and decide, you know what this
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.320]   article needs is more dancing echoes.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.760]   It's the strangest thing.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:30.200]   The real story of how Amazon built the echo, of course, it's in Amazon's Lab 126 where
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.160]   the fire phone was built.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.520]   It was originally created to build the Kindle.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.320]   And it was one of, I think it was Project D or E, they do them in the alphabet.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.800]   The one before it was augmented reality apparently.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:52.080]   The team somehow was doing something along the lines of a voice response system.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.240]   Jeff Bezos didn't really think much of it, but they went ahead.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.440]   Some have reported that's one of the issues at Amazon is that you spend a lot of energy,
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:07.960]   way too much energy, thinking about whether Jeff will like it and doing more things probably
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.440]   than you would.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.880]   C was an augmented reality program of some kind which died.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:22.760]   Project D ended up being the echo, despite Bezos's suspicion of the whole thing.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.200]   It's a good article, well researched, if you can ignore it.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.880]   I think this is a good one for a pocket.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.760]   Just put it in pocket or readability and you won't see the animation.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.040]   One little bit of trivia that I didn't know and I thought I knew everything about Amazon
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.680]   in Lab 126 was that 126 is a reference to the alphabet.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.560]   One representing the letter A and 26 representing the letter Z.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.480]   And I thought I always wanted what that 126 was all about.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:55.960]   They also talked about the name and the wake up because apparently Bezos wanted it to be
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.640]   Amazon and his engineers were saying, "You can't because it'll wake up all the time."
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:07.160]   People say Amazon a lot on TV, everywhere, sometimes not even referring to us.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.880]   They wanted to be ALEXA which is much less commonly referred to.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.680]   Jeff resisted but eventually I think...
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.960]   They should just let you make it whatever you want though.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.440]   I want the hot word to be the hot word I want it to be.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:25.680]   The only time I've ever seen that is in the Moto X where you could create your own.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.960]   And I guess it's because it uses too much processor power to have RB3 words.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.800]   You want to have just a few patterns built in.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.800]   And still...
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800]   I know.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.080]   Well, we got a long way to go, right?
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.760]   Save the processing locally.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.560]   Overwrite the RAM.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560]   Do something.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560]   With the ROM.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.560]   Do...
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.560]   There!
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.560]   Make it better.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.440]   And then there's people in Cuba who don't have water for four days.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   I just want to remind you.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:57.680]   Although I have the feeling that Cubans rather have good internet connectivity than water.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.680]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.840]   That just shows you how much...
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.320]   I think you're right.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.400]   I think once people really get experience of the internet, the world changes.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.760]   It's a different world we live in.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.120]   Google set up this...
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.400]   I know we talked a lot about Cuba earlier but one last thing I had to mention.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:25.400]   Google partnered with an artist whose name is Kacho, K-C-H-O and set up a room at Kacho's
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.960]   sort of an art compound.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.800]   And this artist does lots and lots of things to get young people involved in art and culture
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.880]   and so on.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:42.840]   And this partnership with Cuba has 20 Chromebooks set up and these Chromebooks are on a super
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.320]   fast Wi-Fi that's supposedly 70 times faster than the government Wi-Fi.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.280]   It's literally the fastest internet in Cuba.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.520]   I don't know how Google does this stuff.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:56.480]   How they provide super fast connectivity in a place that just doesn't have it anywhere
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.120]   else.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:04.080]   But they also had Google Cardboard there and they also had free Wi-Fi which is the only
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.520]   place in Cuba where you can actually use Wi-Fi for free.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.640]   And what's fascinating about it is people are lining up to use those fast Chromebooks.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.520]   Nobody was paying attention to Cardboard because Cardboard, I'm sure they all tried it.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.280]   Oh, this is really neat.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.240]   They really just want to get aligned.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:27.120]   And man, you get one hour with this fast Wi-Fi and people were just locked into these screens
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.120]   for that hour.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.280]   It was really something to see they are so hungry for good internet.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.800]   Okay, we really take it for granted, don't we?
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.840]   You know, it's just the fact that you can stream Game of Thrones or, you know, House
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   of Cards.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.960]   It's really remarkable, really remarkable.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.880]   And a couple of change law, I will do the change law which is just going to be a bunch
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   of new features.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.760]   Google launched a bunch of new features today and I think it's Danny Sullivan said it was
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   to distract people from the EU decision.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.640]   Google Play Music now of course has podcast support.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.480]   It's on Android, it's on the web.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.480]   We are on it.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.240]   We are a big part of it.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.160]   It's kind of rolling out slowly to Android.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:13.280]   I don't yet have it on Android, but on the web, if you're a Google Play music user, there
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:20.080]   will be now a new menu that says podcasts and you can search for podcasts over here under
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.200]   the Humberjare.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:30.640]   You can search for podcasts or you can search for tweets that way to see what all the shows
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.200]   we do or you can search for individual shows as well.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.240]   And I imagine most podcasts will be on here.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.280]   I think the podcaster has to submit just as they do with iTunes.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:45.840]   So that may be a short while before your favorite podcast is on there.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:52.040]   They've added new features to inbox which I just learned about because right before the
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.920]   show I checked TechMeam and so I'm not really up on this.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.320]   Maybe you are more Danny.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.120]   I like Google inbox.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.840]   We finally got Jeff Jarvis to use it.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.840]   He fought it for a long time.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:10.080]   Now it will keep track of events in your inbox and I think collate them.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:15.760]   Yeah, puts all the email that you have around a specific event together.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.440]   So sometimes if you have a trip coming up, you have the individual emails coming out
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.440]   over a period of weeks that will just group them all together nicely.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.440]   That's great.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.440]   That's awesome.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:32.680]   Email newsletters will have a preview kind of rolling up all the issues into a single preview.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.360]   You can store links that you want to remember with save to inbox.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.600]   So I'm not sure.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.240]   You have to get the, I will get this the inbox by Gmail Chrome extension.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.960]   And then now I guess in Chrome I can save it to my email.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960]   I don't understand.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.800]   It becomes an option in the share function on both Android and iOS when you say just hit
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:01.600]   the share, you can plug it in there so that like saving a link or sharing a home.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.400]   Chrome has been missing this email link forever, right?
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.520]   Every other browser, there's an, you just email a link.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.240]   It doesn't seem like you can do that on Chrome unless I'm missing something.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.440]   So now you add the inbox extension.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.880]   So what it's just going to save it to my inbox.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.040]   Yeah, it'll create an item in the inbox.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.240]   I love that because I use inbox for everything to any sort of information I want to retain.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.080]   I just throw in an inbox and deal with it later.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.720]   So that works great for me.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.240]   So it also has another entry share via email.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.120]   So how will you finally add it that?
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:40.640]   You think that'll be a fundamental browser capability, but they finally added that.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:48.360]   Google fiber wants to beam wireless internet to your home according to recode.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:53.000]   I guess this means, I mean, it makes sense because fiber, laying fiber is very costly.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.680]   It was estimated that Verizon spent $5,000 per subscriber to give them Fios.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:04.000]   So now it's looking at wireless high speed internet, solving that expensive last mile
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   problem.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.240]   I'll take it, just point it my way.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.960]   Point the beam at me.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.360]   Let's see.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.800]   Google claims YouTube ads are more effective than TV.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800]   Okay.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   The TV people disagree.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:27.200]   I think some might disagree, but okay.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.400]   Oh, Kevin Marks said this happened to him.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:37.760]   The Marshmallow 6.01 update is is breaking some people's Nexus 6s.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:43.520]   So if you have an older Nexus 6, be careful about the April security patch.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.760]   That's an over the air update.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.640]   They don't build them security patches, but that's what they are.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.240]   That's going to break my Nexus 6.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.440]   Be careful.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.560]   It does some and it breaks Kevin Marks's Nexus 6.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.560]   How do I be careful?
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560]   Do I just?
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560]   Don't take it.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.560]   Don't take it.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.120]   They do give you a chance.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.600]   It's not an automatic install.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.520]   There is a way to recover according to somebody named Techno Bill.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:11.680]   I trust him implicitly, which means put it.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.040]   You have to put the Android and beta on your Nexus 6.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.680]   Check developer options.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.280]   I don't know.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.280]   It's complicated.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   Sorry.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.120]   I should just wait until that goes away and they un-
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.880]   I bet it's gone by now.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   But I wouldn't wait.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   I would still wait.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.240]   I only updated like every three months or so.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.240]   You know what?
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.240]   I see an Android update.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.240]   I do it.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.240]   I'm getting up and down.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.240]   I think, oh, maybe I'm getting that roll.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.240]   I don't know.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240]   I just get excited.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.600]   I just can't wait.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   YouTube has rolled out support for 360 degree live streams plus, and I think this is very
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.080]   important, spatial audio.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.400]   So they've always had 360 degree videos, but this will be live now.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.680]   Now I don't know if you have hardware to do that.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.640]   The cameras that do live 360 degree video are few and far between.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.960]   Yeah, it's like 8K video.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.080]   It's like they can afford it, but who's going to do it?
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080]   Who's going to do it?
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080]   And how do you watch it?
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.400]   The other thing that will be challenging too is that you have to be so careful with the
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.200]   360 video.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.400]   If you're like the first one I shot, I'm holding my phone, my thing up like this, right?
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.560]   And they realize, oh, great.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.280]   This whole back part is just your head.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.280]   You know, like what they were showing you their thing.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.280]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.720]   But, you know, I suppose you, you know, I don't know.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.720]   It's 360.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:34.720]   It's awesome.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.920]   360 audio though, I think is going to be a critical feature.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.600]   And again, this requires hardware that has microphones in every direction.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.040]   But that's kind of what you want.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.280]   If you're looking over there, the sound should move, right?
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.280]   So that's going to be a big deal.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.560]   Again, I don't know what kind of hardware you're going to have to have to do it.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.840]   But I suppose it's coming along the OZO, which is Nokia's camera.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   We were playing with that earlier.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   We made a couple of OZO videos in the new screensavers and back pre-weekly with Alex
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.320]   Lindsey, who had one on loan.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.000]   He actually, I think he has three OZOs at the NAB show.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.080]   He's recording three 360 degree cameras.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.320]   One of them on a moving jib.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.320]   I don't, but there's $60,000 each.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.200]   The problem is they're not live streaming.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.200]   This is the video.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.760]   This took him a week to generate this 10 minute video because it's four hours per minute
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.920]   of video to stitch it.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.360]   Four hours of processing for every minute of video you shoot.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.640]   And you see, it doesn't even look all that good.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.040]   But that just changes everything.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.040]   Why?
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.440]   Oh, you're being sarcastic.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   Okay.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.040]   Especially when you get sent to you by your chatbot.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.040]   Look.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:55.280]   I think we've got it all covered.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.680]   Anything else you guys want to?
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:03.960]   There was an interesting article about Magic Leap in Wired.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:10.000]   But as Neelai Patel writes in The Verge in A Critique of It, they didn't really ask the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.880]   important questions in The Wired.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.680]   It was an interesting profile.
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.680]   But here's the five burning questions Neelai Patel would like to know.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:20.680]   What the hell is it?
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.520]   It didn't answer anything.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.320]   It was mostly like a press release.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.600]   It was just like Magic Leap.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.600]   It was like, I'm sorry.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.600]   It just works.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.520]   It was a nice article about what's going on with the art.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.200]   And Kevin Kelly, who wrote it, is great.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.200]   And I love him.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.360]   Yeah, no, but I did not get inside Magic Leap.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.920]   Like I don't think somebody said we don't even see what the headset is.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.920]   We still don't.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:46.120]   In fact, this is the picture they showed as a guy staring into a obviously prototype device
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.320]   with lots of glowing wires coming out of it.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:55.800]   That's a nice article about, hey, VR is growing and maybe this will finally be the time that
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:01.200]   it makes it unlike this article that could have come straight out of the 1990s that talked
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.200]   about.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.720]   It literally could have been a 1990s article about how VR was.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.120]   Someday.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.400]   But now, the difference is people really are getting these headsets.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.400]   If you have the gear, like we were joking earlier, I've got three gear VR sitting around.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:18.360]   You really can do it.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.240]   And people really are kind of blown away by it.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.920]   I was showing my business partner at the gear VR where you have the dinosaur.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.280]   He was just like, oh, oh.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.320]   It's really cool, isn't it?
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   It really is.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320]   I don't think I don't.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.320]   I'm that often.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.320]   Like it's.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.240]   It magically is AR, of course.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.120]   And they've described it, but they haven't really described how it works as glasses that
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.560]   are lightweight and thin.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.920]   And then that somehow magically it just stuff appears in your field of view and your eye
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.840]   naturally focuses.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.080]   They offer this video.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.920]   But as Neil I says, well, but they explain nothing.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.200]   What was it shot with?
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.560]   How is the camera focusing?
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.760]   Where is it focusing?
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.080]   Where does this stuff appear?
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.800]   And there's a call coming in from Google Hangouts.
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.680]   Is there an interface for Google Hangouts?
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.880]   Or is this just completely a mockup?
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:12.560]   How does it know any of this information?
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.080]   It's and Kevin Kelly never answers any of these questions.
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:24.200]   So while we're all kind of intrigued by Magic Leap, there's still absolutely no idea of
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.200]   how it works.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:32.560]   But it's kind of funny that one of the impressive things about Magic Leap is their ability to
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.280]   prevent anybody from knowing anything.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.760]   Yeah, it reminds me of.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.360]   Yeah, they've raised a billion dollars.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.720]   They've gotten Google backing.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.600]   They according to this article, the one thing that they hinted at that was somewhat intriguing
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:52.880]   was that the main core competency of Magic Leap is unique technology that makes the 3D
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.200]   aspect of it incredibly believable.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:00.560]   And so again, we don't know what that is, how it works or anything.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.480]   But the fact that they have been able to raise that much money and at the same time,
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:11.000]   they have the discipline to prevent us from knowing anything about it is in a way a suggestion
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.480]   that this company is somewhat formidable.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.680]   And it's very difficult to keep those kind of secrets.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.600]   Or they're Theranos.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:28.520]   I mean, given the history of the world, the latter is more likely than the former, to be
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.520]   honest with you.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.960]   I'm not casting aspersions.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.800]   But at some point, you're going to have to show this technology to somebody and it's
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.600]   going to have to be real.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.200]   Everything we've seen I think is fake.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:47.120]   Well, I mean, the same goes to a certain extent for Microsoft HoloLens.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.560]   But no, no, no, because if people have tried it on and it works and you can see what you
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.120]   see, it's disappointing, but it's real.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:00.840]   I mean, at least to Microsoft's credit, they're letting people buy them and try them on and
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:01.840]   use them.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:04.880]   And so that exists, much as Oculus Rift exists.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:09.840]   I'm not convinced that Magic Leap exists.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.080]   Maybe just read an article that was inside Magic Leap.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.480]   So what questions could you have?
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:22.120]   Well, my son told me about a bottle that some Austrian inventors have created that pulls
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.280]   water out of the air and fills itself up.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:29.120]   It's a magically refilling water bottle in an hour, even in the desert.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.480]   It will fill itself up with water.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.880]   And I said, well, you know, you read this stuff.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.160]   You see these kickstart, it was like a crowdfunded campaign.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.600]   You say, you got to really think, is that possible?
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.240]   Do they have one?
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.680]   Does it work?
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.360]   I'm still a little skeptical.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.760]   I mean, I would love Magic Leap to be real.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.760]   I will be the first to buy one.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:55.560]   Mmm, Burf Feinstein, we all talked about it.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.320]   Plus, C-Monkeys dance to music.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.400]   And they do.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   They're real.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:01.400]   They're live.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.720]   You know, maybe that's it.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.880]   I bought too many things from the back of comic books to believe any of this stuff anymore.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.720]   I bought X-ray glasses.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.360]   I bought a submarine.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.760]   Didn't really work.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:17.920]   I never got the plans for my hovercraft.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.920]   Okay.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:25.240]   Do you want to talk about the UC Davis article in the New York Times?
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.480]   You're quoted, Danny Sullivan.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.880]   UC Davis, as everyone knows and remembers well, that was the New York Times complain
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.440]   about my watch locker.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:43.400]   As many of you remember well, UC Davis, very famously in 2011, campus, copper, pepper sprayed,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:48.000]   students, non-violent, sit down, protesters.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.400]   And actually, if you watch the video, it's just horrific.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:32:00.240]   And unfortunately, when you do a search, unfortunately for UC Davis, for the chancellor's name or UC Davis,
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.640]   you get this video.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.840]   UC Davis didn't like that.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:07.120]   They spent 175, look at this guy.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.640]   They're just spraying him.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:16.480]   Like, anyway, trying to bury this video.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.400]   They hired a company, Nevins and Associates.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.160]   This is like a reputation management, right, Danny?
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:28.080]   Yeah, I mean, there's nothing unusual about this other than it was by public universities
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:34.160]   with public funds and not actually doing it well.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:39.640]   So like we didn't even run an article on it because this was like so commonplace, but
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:43.120]   it definitely got attention out there.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.000]   It's reputation management.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.760]   It's SEO, but very specialized SEO.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:54.040]   The problem in this case is first of all, they didn't like, if you read the contract,
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.040]   I think I was describing the thing, I found it laughable.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.320]   The contract didn't describe what it was they were trying to fix, like improve things,
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.720]   improve what.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.480]   It didn't say that when you search for UC Davis, you were actually getting this stuff.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.160]   Or when you're searching for the chancellor's name.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:13.320]   And in fact, the day the article ran about their attempts all those years later, those
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.560]   results were very clean.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:17.920]   You know, years had passed, really literally years have passed at this point and it wasn't
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.560]   coming up that way.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:24.360]   But the contract talked about trying to somehow get rid of all the results, which you were
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.240]   never going to be able to do.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.760]   And this totally a case that a lot of reputation management companies will try to bring in new
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.000]   content that kind of pushes down the older content.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.600]   But some of the older content and maybe this negative content may disappear on its own anyway.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:46.120]   But overall, it was a lot of money that they spent without any specific measure, specific
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.480]   measureables about what they were getting.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:51.040]   There was nothing like, and here's how we're going to prove that this actually worked and
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:55.760]   if it didn't work, you're going to get your money back or even kind of like, we can try
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.320]   this stuff, but it's not necessarily going to help.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.040]   So after that learning experience, they decided to spend even more money with the second firm
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:06.600]   after working with the first firm for a year, not getting the results.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.800]   And spend more money with the second firm, which may or may not have done anything different
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.800]   either.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.360]   And then of course, the whole thing comes out.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.880]   So now they get even more negative publicity off of what they were trying to bury in the
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.400]   first place, the whole Streisand effect that, you know, as it's known or whatever, they'd
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:28.120]   have been better off really just trying to, I don't know, I mean, one of the things they
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:31.440]   actually could have done is just dealt with the problem, right?
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.920]   Owned it, said this is what happened at our campus.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.840]   We're working to make sure it doesn't happen again and, you know, go on with it from there.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840]   That's the way to deal with all of this.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.040]   This is the deal with the right to be forgotten and all of that.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.240]   You can't delete history unless you win.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.400]   If you win the word, then you can do whatever you want in the EU.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:56.360]   But so these are just to make this clear because I think a lot of people know, hear
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:00.320]   about this than they're we, I don't do ads for, but there are a lot of radio ads for
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.840]   companies that do reputation management.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.520]   What they do, they mention a low price thing that does absolutely nothing.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.200]   Then for a significant amount of money, like $10,000 a month, they will generate a ton
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:18.000]   of content, kind of just stupid, meaningless content with your name attached so that when
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.520]   people do a search, that content supposedly will rise to the top of search results.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:28.520]   But you're saying, Danny, that kind of, that, it really depends on the situation.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:35.840]   So you have some people who are private individuals who maybe have fairly unique names.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.400]   And when you search for them, let's say they had gotten arrested and it ran in a local
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.360]   paper, that might show up because there's just not a lot of stuff.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.040]   So if they go through and they create a Facebook account, a Twitter account, and a LinkedIn
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.480]   account and all this other stuff, Google tends to favor returning, if you will, brand pages,
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.840]   your personal pages.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:55.560]   And it may be enough to knock that stuff down.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.920]   And then they could go through and create lots of other content.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:02.400]   And yeah, for that private person, it might be effective.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:08.040]   For a bigger company, it might help move it further down.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.200]   Like I haven't looked at the results for BP recently, right?
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:15.320]   But I'm pretty sure that BP's search results are not dominated by the oil spill.
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.320]   I'm taking a look at them now.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.320]   There's global BP.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.760]   Well, I've got news results.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.120]   You never need to get rid of the news results.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:27.320]   But the rest of the stuff that's showing up there, you know, is not dominated.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.400]   And so you're always going to have, like for a brand, if there's something back in the
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.760]   news, the new stuff is fresh.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.320]   You can't get rid of that.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:40.280]   But yeah, it can be effective if it's done right and you're realistic about it may not
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.200]   always work the way that you want.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.320]   And I think you're going to be even more effective if you understand that you go into the approach
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.560]   with not something that's so blatant, like we were trying to bury this other stuff.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.560]   Right.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.560]   Right.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.560]   Right.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.600]   You know, if Davis had embraced this as, you know, this terrible thing happened on our
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.560]   campus, we were embarrassed about it.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.400]   And here's the story of how we're improving it.
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.560]   It would have been so much more positive because first of all, they would have been
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.400]   taking positive action.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.400]   Right.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.720]   Instead, it just looks like you did this horrible thing and now you're just trying to hope to
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.720]   get rid of it.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.800]   Like nobody remembers it.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:19.040]   So one thing's it probably had a lot more to do with the chancellor trying to protect
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.960]   his name than anything else.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.640]   But and just not understanding how the internet works.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:29.000]   I mean, there's not any possible way that you can get this news story off of a search
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.640]   for UC Davis because this is literally the biggest news that this university has produced
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.640]   in the last decade.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.640]   Right.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.560]   But it was off the results.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.520]   I mean, it was just naturally off the result.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:41.520]   I mean, you're right.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.400]   You're never going to get rid of UC Davis pepper spray if you searched for it.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.600]   But when you were searching for just UC Davis, this was not dominating the results.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.520]   Well, we're not dominating, but they're there on the front page.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.680]   One of the ways that Google search results work is that Google actually somehow tries
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.240]   to figure out, I'm not telling you this, Danny, you know, this better than I do, but it tries
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.760]   to understand whether something's positive or negative.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.320]   And if there's lots of positive, it says it throws in some negative.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:17.520]   It tries to de-filter bubble the search engine results to make sure that there's some semblance
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.520]   of balance.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.600]   Oh, no, it doesn't do anything like that at all.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.560]   Unless you're reading something different than I know.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.560]   If you look at Eli Parriser's filter bubble book, he actually addresses this mechanism.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.960]   It was one of Google's defenses against the filter bubble thing.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.800]   Another one is which that Google claims that they don't filter search results.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.240]   They only rank them.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:47.760]   But if you, for example, I think this goes for all of us.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.000]   Let's say Danny Sullivan is a beloved figure in technology journalism.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.120]   That's the majority of the things that people say about Danny Sullivan are very, very positive.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.600]   And if a tiny minority of people say something negative, those are going to get an unusually
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.960]   high ranking in Google searches because they're negative.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.200]   And because so much of Elsevit is positive.
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.520]   Ooh, that's not good.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.240]   Well, I mean, it goes for Leo LaPorte and Mike Elgin as well.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:21.000]   It tries to almost artificially balance positive as negative so that results can't be padded.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.720]   Is it really doing that?
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.360]   I don't think it's doing that.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:30.240]   And it's been a while since I've read Eli's book, but I don't think it's trying to do
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240]   that.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.560]   And there's all sorts of bad things because if it was trying to do sentiment analysis of
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:40.080]   the different search results, and then it said, "Hey, but let's just throw in some bad stuff.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.360]   Anybody could just make up bad stuff."
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.880]   It's really, my understanding of the balance that it's trying to do, it tends to be more
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.560]   like to show a variety of results.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.480]   Right, of sources as opposed to variety of sentiments.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:58.720]   But if you could just go back and look at this, you can do the search for UC Davis now.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:02.520]   And before the story broke, it wasn't there.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.200]   I remember looking the day the story came out and I looked and there was nothing there.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.440]   It was like the Wikipedia page, the Facebook page, the athletic site.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.680]   They were one of their best college ranking things, their YouTube page.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.280]   There was no, and that's very standard for brands.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.880]   If you do a search for say Target right now, right, or do a search for McDonald's right
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:29.520]   now, Google over the past few years has actually really shifted things so that if you're a
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.840]   friend, it just kind of rewards your standard stuff.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.480]   There's a lot of people who hate McDonald's right here.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:40.520]   I'm searching for McDonald's and there's no don't shopping McDonald's stuff that's coming
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.520]   up.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.280]   It kind of brings up the standard McDonald's stuff, the official McDonald's stuff.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   Right, exactly.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   And a few years ago, you would have gotten that or if I search for like Diet Coke.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.800]   I'm sure that that's the brands that put pressure on Google to do that right or...
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.600]   Well, they haven't directly done it.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:03.600]   I think it's been a combination of Google like not wanting to deal with the hassles that
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:08.120]   if they're shifting more towards favoring stuff that's officially from a brand and someone's
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:11.560]   just searching for a brand, it's less controversial.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.360]   You have less people getting angry at you.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.880]   But people who are looking for something bad that they've heard about it still find it,
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:18.880]   right?
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.880]   So, you know, if you...
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.800]   That's why if you go UC Davis or even if you search for the chance, what UC Davis is
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:31.640]   Linda Katehi, I may not be pronouncing it right, but if you search for her on Google, her stuff
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.720]   was not that bad.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:39.160]   You can see that the only real negative thing that was happening like was coming up in March.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.920]   It wasn't even going to the pepper spray thing.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:46.680]   So they made it worse for themselves by getting into the new new stuff that was going on.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.880]   You were looking at the results because I mean, it's just really messed it up because...
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:51.880]   Right.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.600]   They generated all this new stuff trying to hide the new stuff.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.600]   It's just the backfired.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.400]   It wasn't necessarily there anyway.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.400]   Right.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.400]   Backfired.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.400]   Well, there you go.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.400]   Don't mess around.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.440]   Just accept what our Google overlords say about you.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.240]   Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.440]   No, I mean, I...
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.000]   It's...
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]   You know, it's just hard.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.840]   This is really hard.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.480]   It's like saying that if you were having negative stuff written about you in a newspaper
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:27.120]   that you should just take it, no, you would probably wage a PR campaign.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:33.440]   But there's a difference between waging a good PR campaign that has underlying it real
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.000]   change and good PR.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]   Right.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000]   That's the way to do it.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.440]   Versus just a bad PR campaign.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.040]   And in fact, the UC Davis did a lot.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.440]   They did an investigation.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.920]   They put the officer on leave.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.960]   I don't know if they ultimately fired him, but they did stuff.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.760]   That's what you want to promote, not try to bury the story entirely.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.760]   That's a mistake.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.440]   And so, you know, it was just...
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:00.160]   I would have been fascinated on how they actually did the research to find these companies.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.320]   It was so...
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.720]   That's the most annoying thing all this.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.440]   It was a lot of money wasted.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.440]   Mm-hmm.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.200]   Because no one really seemed to understand what they were doing.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.480]   More than wasted, yeah.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.320]   Hey, good news for free speech.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:22.760]   And for Google, the Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider the challenge to Google's
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.800]   book scanning project.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:33.240]   A district court had said somewhat reluctantly, but said that that was a fair use to scan those
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.160]   books within the boundaries of fair use.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:44.200]   And while the Publishers Association appealed it, they have now been rejected by the Supreme
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.440]   Court, which means, I think, finally, the Google book case is over.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.440]   That's the end of that, unless there's a higher court that I don't know if I guess they
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440]   go to the EU.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.440]   [laughter]
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:02.960]   We're going to take a break and come back with our final picks or tips or whatever.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.080]   It's so great to have you, Mike Elgin from Mexico, off his jots through Cuba.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.080]   It's great to be here.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.080]   Yeah, I really appreciate it.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.080]   It's so great to be here.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.080]   It's so good to show again.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.320]   Everything about as light as you can was just a couple of backpacks.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.160]   He packed a PR40 microphone with him, which, it's not an inconsiderable amount.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.120]   I mean, it's heavier than your laptop, probably.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.120]   Did you bring a laptop?
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.120]   It's an arm.
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120]   I.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.120]   Oh, yes.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:27.120]   I did.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.120]   Definitely.
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:31.240]   I brought a laptop only in the necessities, only the very bare necessities, so the PR40, but
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:36.440]   not, I put in storage all the stuff that goes around it, the pop filter that stand, all
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.440]   of that stuff.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.440]   That's why I'm holding it.
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.000]   But you got to have the PR40.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.240]   I'm so glad you brought it.
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240]   I really am.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.240]   Thank you.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.320]   And of course, the interface that makes it possible to use that with Skype.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.320]   So that's-
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.320]   Exactly.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.320]   Exactly.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.320]   Danny Sullivan also here.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.040]   We always love Danny's insights.
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.600]   There's probably nobody who better understands how Google works.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.360]   He is, of course, the founder of SearchEngineLand.com.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.360]   Marketing, what is it?
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:01.360]   Marketing Engine Land?
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:06.520]   SearchEngineLand.com, which is all the search engine and search marketing advice and reporting.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:09.320]   And then marketing land is our general one about digital marketing.
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.320]   And we have a lot of different people.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.320]   And we have a lot of different people.
