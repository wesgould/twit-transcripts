[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.280]   Google-- let's show the covers.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.600]   Google the Google versus Google Cloud.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.800]   All the other clouds that are puffing along right next
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.600]   to the Google Cloud.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.960]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.880]   That one's a vape cloud.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.760]   Ignore that one.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   Also, Facebook and Twitter, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.960]   I give you Gina Trapani of ThinkUp.com.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.760]   Hello.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.040]   Good to have you, Gina.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.440]   She's also--
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.000]   Good to be here.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.640]   --host of all about Android.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.160]   Oh yeah.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.680]   She's nice.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.840]   She's playing network every Tuesday night.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.360]   We make her work right in the middle of the week.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.960]   Jeff Jarvis is back home where the snow--
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.160]   has it come up to the windows yet, Jeff?
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.040]   I'm not in Buffalo, thank goodness.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.880]   The East Coast is not all the same.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.640]   Yes it is.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.320]   I think Gina should put her hoodie over her head
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.720]   since she's freezing.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   Both of you, I think.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.880]   It is freezing here.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600]   This is why I have my fuzzy, fuzzy hoodie on here because--
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.240]   Wow, that's cute.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.920]   Is that a unicorn hoodie?
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.640]   It's cold.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360]   You look so adorable in that.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.160]   I think this was like a Sam's Club special.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   My mother-in-law gave it to me.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.640]   It's great.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   It's so warm.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.680]   You really understand when you're walking around
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.800]   in sub-freezing weather, why warm weather,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.400]   where weather you're so important?
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360]   Yes.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yes, I'm being re-reminded after--
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.960]   I was kind of in denial about the winter
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.320]   because I moved back last winter.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   I was like, oh, this is a weird freak thing.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.280]   Now I'm like, oh, we committed to this.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.120]   This is going to be a season thing.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.680]   And it's really February that you really start hating it.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.480]   No, remember, this is nothing.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.880]   I was like, it's not even December yet today.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.800]   That's what I was saying.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.840]   I was saying, no, friend.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.120]   It's not even December.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.640]   What is this?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   Wrong.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.840]   It's wrong.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   Stay inside, stay warm.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.480]   Be toasty.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.760]   It's going to be 65 this weekend.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.960]   Oh, good.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.400]   I now feel like my parents talking about the weather.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.480]   I know.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.920]   I know.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.760]   I know.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.800]   Let's talk about Uber.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   Oh, boy.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.040]   At first, I wasn't going to.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.840]   But now I feel like I have to.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.040]   Let's do it.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   Let's do this.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.120]   It's phenomenal.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.560]   Jesus, what a story.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.680]   I mean--
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.840]   It's kind of depressing to me that it's only become
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.880]   a huge story once it affected journalists.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.440]   Yeah, typical, isn't it?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.520]   It's like gamergate.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.080]   As soon as you attack the journalist, now, now
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.600]   we got to start, amen.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.520]   So Uber has always been pretty aggressive.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.800]   And I think in some regard, this is just kind of a peek
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.160]   inside the startup culture, which
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.120]   can tend to be not only a boys club,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.960]   but an agro-boys club.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.240]   Really, obnoxious.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.800]   Obnoxious.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.720]   And a little bit sleek through the programmer
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.480]   and all of that stuff.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   But really, I'm not familiar with it
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.120]   because I don't hang out with VCs or with startups or anything.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.800]   Jeff, I think you do a little bit more.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.360]   Gina, you're in a startup.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.600]   Is this kind of aggressive culture that we're seeing here
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   with Uber kind of typical?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.200]   It's like Uber's just the darling of the valley.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.560]   And there is this whole sort of undercurrent of growth hacking
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.320]   and hustle and this sort of--
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.680]   I don't know, this idea that you just
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.320]   stop at nothing to succeed.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.800]   The Uberization of everything.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.640]   Uber has become this weird sentiment.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.160]   For me, I feel like it's a synonym for either the future
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   of technology and convenience or a company that treats its drivers
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.280]   terribly and resorts to unethical tactics
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.480]   to acquire customers.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.560]   It's this very weird split double thing, double-edged sword
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.160]   with Uber.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.080]   When Uber has raised more money probably
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.560]   than any startup in current Silicon Valley startup,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.760]   it's $1.5 billion in six rounds from 32 investors,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.360]   including several $100 million from Google Ventures.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.520]   Founded by Travis Kalanek and Garrett Camp,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.680]   we should explain, for those who don't know,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.120]   although I imagine most of our audience does,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.080]   it's a cab service, in effect.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.120]   Originally it was a black car service.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   The thing that made it different was, instead of phoning them up
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.520]   and saying, pick me up, I'm ready to go.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.080]   You have an app on your phone.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.960]   And it was actually a very lovely experience.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.240]   The app would already have your credit card information.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.440]   You'd tap it, say, I want to ride.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.360]   You could see how far away the car was.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.800]   You could see as it approached on a map,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.560]   you'd see a picture of your driver.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.040]   Your driver would see a picture of you
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.360]   and where to pick you up.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.440]   You'd get in the car, you'd go where you wanted to,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.360]   and then you'd get out of the car.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.200]   And that would be it.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.480]   The tip and the payment all handled by Uber.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.120]   So it was a very nice friction-free transaction.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   The early Uber cars were all kind of nice black cars.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.560]   They've now-- and then they had UberX,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.360]   which was somewhat of a lower-cost service.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   And I think they maybe even go lower than that.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480]   So there's a variety of cars that might--
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   Uber bike.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   Uber bike.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.720]   And then, of course, they got a lot of heat in Washington, DC,
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.360]   in New York City, in Toronto.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   I think that Toronto is about to make Uber illegal,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.920]   because the taxi services said this is essentially
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.480]   an unlicensed taxi service.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.800]   And you make us buy medallions and go through a huge regulatory
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   hoops, and you're not doing that to Uber.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.720]   And I don't know whether it's lobbying from the taxi
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.120]   services or--
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.760]   Sure, right.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.280]   --the taxi.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.320]   Yeah, I think it is probably.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.200]   But the taxi commission-- it's kind of like the Airbnb problems
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.320]   with the hotel commissions.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.680]   It's a new way of doing things.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.040]   And there maybe are some concerns.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.320]   An Uber car hit an immigrant family in San Francisco
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.520]   a few months ago and killed a six-year-old.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.000]   There have been reports of alleged reports of sexual attacks
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   in Uber cars by Uber drivers.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.960]   But really, the issues that's surfacing now
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.160]   is the aggressive promotion of Uber.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.600]   First, a couple of months ago, we heard that Uber was going
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.760]   after Lyft by actually getting in Lyft cars
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.440]   and trying to solicit their drivers.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.560]   Right.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.600]   Well, Lyft is one of their competitors,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.520]   and they would have-- supposedly, they had Uber employees
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.800]   calling in Lyft rides, getting the Lyft drivers
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.840]   to go to pick them up and then canceling, right?
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.440]   Like, basically taking away-- taking away their fares
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.680]   or getting into these cars and pitching Lyft drivers
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.760]   to move over to Uber about all the reasons why Uber was better
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.840]   for them.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.000]   You know what's interesting?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.320]   The name Uber, which sounds--
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.200]   at the beginning, they sounded like they're better.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.720]   They're good.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.040]   And now it's starting to sound like Deutsche
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.000]   Line Uber-alice.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.440]   It's like the connotations are not as good.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.640]   So the latest kerfuffle came from a private event
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.600]   that Uber had, in which one of their senior vice presidents
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.960]   for business said some things that were pretty appalling.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.240]   Yeah, it was a $1 fund to go after journalists.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.280]   Nobody would know it.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.240]   Yeah, well, and we should explain this.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.000]   So what happened was this was an off-the-record event.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.920]   Ed Norton, the actor, was there.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.120]   Ariana Huffington was there.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.720]   And Michael Wolfe--
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720]   It was a nice event.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.120]   Yeah, it was a nice event.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.320]   Like, they're trying to make nice.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.200]   They know that they're having PR problems, right?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.560]   So they're setting up these fancy dinners
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.400]   with all these heavy hitters to make nice and clean classes
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.960]   and get buddy-buddy because they know
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.240]   that they're having PR problems as a company, right?
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.840]   So this is why they're setting up these dinners.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   OK, so that's just the irony.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.600]   So I don't know the waverly in in New York,
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.160]   but I'm guessing it's a pretty nice--
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.400]   It's hip and nice, yeah.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.280]   So they asked Michael Wolfe of USA today to go.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   And he, in turn, invited to date Ben Smith--
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.440]   happens to be editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed--
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.880]   to come along with him.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   And now, just a little moment here,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.880]   Michael Wolfe, just his background,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.360]   is-- tries to be as nasty as he can be all the time.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   And he went to the Four Square Conference,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.920]   having nothing to do with our app Four Square,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.320]   but Four Square from now layman brothers.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.200]   And it's all off the record that makes us absolutely clear.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   And Wolfe revealed absolutely everything
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.160]   in the event and created a book called "Pilite of the Moagles."
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.840]   So Wolfe is no friend of off the record.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.360]   Wolfe invites--
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.320]   It is an off-the-record event, though.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.840]   And he says--
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.040]   But the argument is, unless the journalist agrees,
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.960]   it ain't off the record.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.120]   And Ben Smith, whom I've crossed on this,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.880]   never heard that was off the record.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.560]   Wolfe is writing in USA today, says,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.840]   I had understood the Uber dinner like other such media
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.160]   meet-and-greets was off the record.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.320]   I neglected, however, to tell Smith this.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.880]   He says, while I might have fairly
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440]   assumed Smith knew the context, this
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.840]   was my oversight, though surely not.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.760]   Uber's-- and you know what?
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.840]   It's everybody's oversight, because as you say,
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.680]   nothing's off the record until it's agreed
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   that it's off the record by both parties.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.600]   So off the record doesn't mean what you think it means.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.960]   I might have thought, too, that as my date,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.880]   he would have asked if there was an understanding.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.440]   Wolfe's throwing Smith under the bus here.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.000]   Yeah, he really is.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.680]   And again, this Michael Wolfe, who himself has absolutely
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.840]   flaunted off the record rules, who wrote an entire book
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.640]   out of the four-square event, which is clearly off the record.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.840]   Everyone knows it's off the record.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.160]   He knew it was off the record.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.200]   And now he's acting holier than now?
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.800]   BS, Michael.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.480]   BS.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.600]   So Ed Norton was there.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.360]   He's a friend of the founder, Sean O'Roberts, and his wife,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.480]   a movie producer, Mort Zuckerman, now the Daily News.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.680]   Interesting that Wolfe is naming names.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.920]   I had an off the record event.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.600]   Pride and event, right?
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.960]   Bob Pittman, the CEO of Clear Channel, Ariana Huffington,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.240]   Chris Hughes, the owner of the New Republic and former
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.280]   Facebooker.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.760]   Chris might even still be a--
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.960]   No, I think he left Facebook.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.680]   He was one of the founders.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.560]   And he says, "A long table about 40 feet or more,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.120]   Smith's was seated at the far end with Emil Michael,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.880]   who was Uber's senior vice president for business."
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.880]   Now Wolfe says, "I was at the other end of the table,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.720]   so I didn't hear this conversation."
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.440]   But apparently, so this is actually additional detail
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.800]   that we haven't read before.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.280]   Smith--
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   Smith--
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.800]   Smith--
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.120]   I'm not happy to just tweet it, but she was also
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.080]   at the other end of the table.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.640]   I didn't hear anything, darling.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.760]   I wasn't there.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.560]   I don't know what is talking about, darling.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.120]   And I'm going to take an Uber right now.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.720]   I don't know why she sounds like Jaja, but she kind of does.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.000]   Smith--
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.760]   No, this is darling.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.640]   She makes a point of never saying darling, but--
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.400]   I know.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.840]   But she should say darling.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.040]   If you're going to talk like that, you should say darling.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.680]   I knew her when she was Ariana Staphanopoulos.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.800]   So, OK, I'm just saying.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.760]   Smith apparently engaged Michael in a discussion
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.280]   of Uber's frequent bad press and came away
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.120]   with a set of quotes or snippets of quotes, which
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.240]   had Michael saying that Uber, if it wanted to,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.920]   could investigate journalists, including their personal lives.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.760]   As Smith represented Michael's conversation,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.720]   and this was a BuzzFeed posting, Michael
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.600]   was the executive at Uber.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.240]   Michael's angle was directed at Sarah Lacey, the founder
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.720]   and editor of Pano Daily.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.520]   And Lacey has been critical of Uber.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.000]   And it's aggressive--
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.480]   Massive tactics and so forth.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.360]   --sexists, a couple of sexes.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   Promo isn't.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.960]   I should mention that in the BuzzFeed article,
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.880]   this is the quote.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.720]   Over dinner, he outlined the notion
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   of spending, quote, a million dollars, end quote,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.640]   to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.560]   That team, could, he said, help Uber fight back
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.280]   against the press.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.640]   They'd look into, quote, your personal lives, your families,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.120]   end quote, and give the media a taste of its own medicine.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.400]   Michael was particularly focused-- this, again,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.040]   has been the BuzzFeed editor-in-chief.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   Michael was particularly focused on one journalist, Sarah
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.120]   Lacey, the editor of Pano Daily, sometimes combative voice
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.320]   inside the industry.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.160]   Lacey recently accused Uber of sexism and misogyny.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.000]   She wrote that she was deleting her Uber app after BuzzFeed
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.840]   reported that Uber appeared to be working with a French escort
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.080]   service.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.360]   She said, I don't know how many more signals we need.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.920]   The company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.400]   At dinner, Michael expressed outrage at Lacey's column
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.800]   and said that women are far more likely to get assaulted
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.440]   by taxi drivers than Uber drivers.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.400]   This is, to me, the sentence that was the most outrageous.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.200]   He said that he thought Lacey should be held personally
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.120]   responsible for any woman who follows her lead
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.080]   in deleting Uber and is then sexually assaulted.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.000]   He said also they could, in particular,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.400]   if they went after her, prove a particular and very specific
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.120]   claim about her personal life.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.440]   By the way, I don't know, and Ben does not report what that is,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.920]   and we don't need to talk about that.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.880]   I don't think that's an issue.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.120]   He, at no point, suggested that Uber has actually hired
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.000]   opposition researchers or plans to.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.640]   He cast as something that would make sense.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.720]   The company would be justified for doing.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.240]   Now, Michael did not deny it.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.600]   He actually issued a statement that said,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.480]   "The remarks attributed me at a private dinner
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.320]   born out of frustration during an informal debate
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.400]   over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   of the company I'm proud to work for.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.120]   Do not reflect my actual views and have no relation
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.680]   to the company's views or approach their wrong
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.840]   no matter the circumstance and I regret them."
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.280]   There was a Twitter, Kalanik had a Twitter storm,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.120]   about 17 tweets in which he apologized.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.320]   At no point did anybody mention whether Michael
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.400]   would be reprimanded or punished or even fired.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:57.800]   This 14 tweet stream saying that what he said had no
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.880]   representation in the company, we're very sorry.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.480]   This is not our company, but there's just been too many
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.920]   signals now.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.280]   Well, and then there's this other issue of them.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.560]   This is the God view.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   The God view.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.400]   The God view, yep.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.720]   You want to talk about that?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.480]   Yeah, I mean, this is when we talk about trust
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.080]   and particularly around Google, because this is a show
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.040]   about Google, this is what I was talking about
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.800]   when I said Google has root to culture.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.760]   So Uber has this thing called God view purportedly,
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.520]   allegedly, which means that certain employees
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.920]   of the company, not drivers who are contractors,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.320]   but employees of the company, particularly executives,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.480]   have this live map of cars, of Uber cars,
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.320]   and people who are in them.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.360]   And they can pretty much track anybody who's going
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.640]   somewhere at any given time.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.840]   And so there was a medium piece by someone who's name.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.600]   I didn't recognize.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.480]   I think maybe he's a VC or he's someone of some importance.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.800]   He said that someone that he knew also in the industry
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.360]   was texting him saying, hey, are you in a car on the street
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.920]   and this street asking him about his location.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.920]   And he said, yeah, how do you know where I am?
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.720]   And she said, well, I'm at this Uber party here in Chicago
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.520]   and they've got the God view up on the--
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.840]   or they've got this view of where your car is up on the wall.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.320]   And you should be proud.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.960]   You've been selected.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.120]   You should be so--
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.460]   You should be so delighted that they're
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.320]   Uber showing off this amazing technology,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.000]   where they get to watch you in real time,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   drive around the city in a car, which is like,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.360]   on this person's head, I never gave them any permission
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.240]   to broadcast my location real time.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.280]   This is-- so there's this accusation out there
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.360]   that people have access to your private information
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.720]   and where you're going and who you're with.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.600]   And what time is that?
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.240]   Is it possible that--
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.560]   I mean, I think you start--
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.360]   there seems to be a pattern.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.040]   But maybe the pattern is being--
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.080]   remember, Uber has been really fought hard
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.000]   against by the taxi commissions.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Lyft has been complained a lot about Uber.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.560]   They're, of course, a direct competitor.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.160]   And some of their complaints turn out
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.320]   to be kind of maybe not--
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.560]   anyway, there seems to be more to this story than meets the eye.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.040]   Let's not forget that Buzzfeed is heavily invested
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.840]   in by Andreessen Horowitz, which also is a lift--
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.520]   one of the major lift investors.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.720]   It seems like there's more to this story than we're--
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.200]   Well, I think that's what you are.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.400]   I think-- somebody said it to Andreessen,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.760]   and he said, oh, come on, really?
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.240]   And I agree with him.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.440]   Conspiracies don't really happen, folks.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.800]   The world's not that well organized.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.760]   And I don't believe for a second that the investors behind Lyft
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.360]   said, let's go and-- let's make sure we get Buzzfeed
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.200]   Ben invited this dinner so they can feed Panda more bad stuff
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.240]   so that it just doesn't allow--
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.840]   And Buzzfeed--
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.680]   But the bad guys here are Uber.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.240]   Uber has not denied that Michael said those things, right?
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.120]   Yeah, I mean, all you have to do is give this guy a half
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.000]   a bottle of wine.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.640]   I mean, it doesn't take much, right?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.760]   I mean, really?
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.280]   Like, I don't mean to--
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.360]   So are you OK?
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.080]   So let me ask you.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   See, it's not an issue for me because I can't use Uber
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.440]   in Petaluma.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.240]   John Hodgman, whom we respect a lot,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.600]   said, I'm going to delete my Uber app.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.000]   Are you going to delete your Uber app?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.040]   My Uber app is deleted.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.760]   I have emailed help and asked them to delete my account
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.520]   because just deleting the app from your phone
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.840]   does not actually close your account.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.640]   And there's no way to close your account on the Uber website.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.320]   You actually have to email them.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.680]   And a human being from Uber wrote back and said she'd
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.160]   be happy to delete my account.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.480]   But she wanted to know why first.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.400]   So I responded and said that I do not trust Uber with my data.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.160]   And could she please close my account?
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.400]   I have yet to hear from her.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.040]   This-- I did this about 24 hours ago.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.520]   So I'm already annoyed that there isn't a self-service.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.840]   Just close my account.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.240]   I feel very strongly that that is giving a customer an exit
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.680]   route is responsibility zero for a service like this.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.920]   They do store my credit card.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.880]   I should be able to say, hey, delete my stuff.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.760]   But that's where I'm at with it.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.400]   I'm waiting for them to get back and say, yeah,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.480]   I'm deleting your account.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.520]   I live in New York City.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.760]   We're getting a car service.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.360]   I mean, when you live in Brooklyn,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.200]   there aren't yellow taxi cabs that drive the streets of Brooklyn.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.400]   But I grew up even as a teenager.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   There's car service, which are these little storefront deals
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.600]   where you call-- yes, I have to make a voice call,
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.440]   which is inconvenient.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.240]   But you call, and then they come and get you.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.280]   And it's cost a few bucks.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.680]   And it's not that big a deal.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.600]   So I plan to use car service and public transportation
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.360]   and yellow taxi cabs for now.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.200]   Because I wasn't really a big Uber user to begin with.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.600]   I know it's a big deal in the San Francisco area,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.640]   because getting a taxi is apparently very difficult.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.720]   But the app experience is nice.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.160]   But there's a service here called Carmel, which has an app
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.400]   that's not as nice as Uber, but is close and that you can hail
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.200]   a car that way.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.600]   So I do that from the airport.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.280]   So yeah, I'm done.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.800]   I'm done with Uber.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.400]   I downloaded Lyft today.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.000]   And I will probably not use Uber.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.160]   And I think that what they've done is really disgusting.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.800]   Yeah, they all up.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.880]   They also went after investors in Lyft.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.120]   And it's just the culture.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.880]   My favorite, favorite line of the whole thing
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.040]   came from a response to a tweet of mine.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.800]   Richard Dunham said, Google is changing its motto
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   to don't be Uber.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.920]   Gosh, you point out that Google is a little bit in bed
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.040]   with Uber because the Google Maps app--
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.080]   Invested.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.720]   They invest-- not only they invest hundreds of millions,
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.040]   though, is the Google Maps app.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.080]   If you have Uber installed on your phone,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.880]   we'll give you a chance to call a cat calling Uber.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.440]   Well, I think that's all the major investors.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.720]   No, that made me super uncomfortable when they did that.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.200]   I remember doing that in the change log
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.520]   and feeling like, wait, whoa, Uber, looze.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.040]   I felt kind of icky about Uber.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.200]   Even then.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.120]   I mean, it's an interesting thing to me.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.320]   What responsibility?
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.360]   And look, we've had our outrage moments on this show
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.680]   about a lot of different things.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.440]   There are times when apologies work and I accept them
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.480]   and I move on.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.640]   And there are times they don't.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.680]   To me, Travis's account, apology just didn't work for me.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.920]   The apology that would have worked
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.440]   was would have been emails fired immediately
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.720]   for what happened, case closed.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.040]   They didn't do that.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.800]   And I feel like all of these things put together
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.840]   just indicate this really horrible company culture.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.160]   And I just can't support it.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.800]   So look, I believe that people make mistakes and can change.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.400]   I've made mistakes and I've apologized.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.160]   But in this case, just wasn't enough.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   So yeah, that's why I'm done with Uber.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:45.960]   And I think now we have to look to Matt Kohler, Bill Gurley,
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   the investors.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.000]   These are people who are on the board.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.040]   So they are the CEOs boss.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.920]   And are they going to hold the CEO accountable here?
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.840]   Let's list their names.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.320]   Ted Meisel, Matt Kohler, Steve Zhang, I guess,
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.040]   Bill Gurley, Timothy Ferris, Paul Brigille, Stephen Steve
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.360]   Russell, and Oscar Salazar.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.440]   That's the board of Uber.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.480]   Those are the real ultimate bosses.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.240]   In one way or the other, I wasn't
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.000]   the board of a company when we had some issues.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.800]   And at the end of the day, it's up to the board to say what's
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.840]   what, and we've got to see how they do.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.640]   There's another story here too, which
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.560]   is the journalistic story.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.280]   I just finished reading Wolf throwing--
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.400]   Mike Wolf of all people throwing buzzfeed down on Google.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.000]   He really throws him under the bus.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.880]   Really, really does.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.440]   And we are another story that was like this recently,
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.400]   when the Guardian went and went in a business
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.840]   meeting with Whisper and found out that Whisper was not
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.920]   really keeping things as private as seemed and seemed
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.160]   to be playing with people's privacy and identity
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.920]   in a lot of ways, and reported that.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.480]   And some journalists, in that case, as in this case,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   kind of got mad at it, oh, you're ruining the game.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.400]   You're ruining the rules.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   You have the record.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.640]   And my response to that is that as a journalist,
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.280]   your first responsibility, full stop,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.400]   is to the public you serve.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.560]   And access journalism is corrupting.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.240]   And Gee, you won't get invited back
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.640]   for the Waverly Dinner.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.240]   Or Gee, you won't get invited by the Silicon Valley Company
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.600]   to do a deal with them.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.960]   Well, fine.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.480]   Fine.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.040]   It's your job to protect the public.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.640]   And if you know something bad is going on,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.080]   even though people who are at the dinner
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.480]   knowing it was off the record, I
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.760]   think that there is some level at which it becomes
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.840]   over the top and to say, I'm telling this off the record,
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.480]   but I feel a need to tell people about this.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.080]   And I certainly as hell would have called Sarah Lacey
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.120]   and told her what was going on.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.960]   This was shameful.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.920]   And I'm ashamed of people in my business
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.640]   that they don't keep their priorities straight
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.600]   in both these stories.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.720]   There is this pattern of stories.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.040]   It just goes on and on and on.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.560]   And as Sarah Lacey points out, Uber's strategies,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.600]   you let the news cycle fade and then you move on
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.200]   and you don't change.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.680]   Right.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.600]   I mean, I think Sarah Lacey's piece was over the top,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.080]   but I understand why it was because they're talking
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.280]   about going in after her personally
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.880]   and the way that nobody will know what's us and attacking her.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.920]   She points out they ran a promotion in France
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.880]   that promises to pair Uber riders with hot chicks.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.600]   Yeah, that was the piece on sexism, misogyny that she wrote
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.240]   that Michael was apparently complaining about at that dinner.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.880]   So that's what kind of pissed him off, right?
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.040]   And so then she wrote her, so Ben called Lacey for comment
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.680]   before he published his story.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.760]   And yeah, she wrote a piece about that.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.560]   And she seemed, look, I don't know what,
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.440]   like we're not gonna discuss whatever thing it is
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.640]   that Michael was saying he knew and was gonna reveal about her.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.080]   I have no idea.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.680]   But she was clearly shaken up and afraid for her kids,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.600]   her young kids.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.080]   And so yes, her piece was clearly, she was clearly,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.920]   yeah, she felt threatened.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.160]   She felt vulnerable and you could tell.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.000]   What is going on?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.240]   We are in the middle of the worst bro culture.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.800]   Well, well, let's go to Bill Cosby.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.160]   That story.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.280]   That's been a lot, but that's going on for decades.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.520]   I'm talking about, well, Tada Hissie Coates,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.480]   who by the way is on the faculty at CUNY,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.080]   is an honored colleague of mine,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.200]   wrote a really, really good essay today in the Atlantic,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.760]   which has redundant in his case,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.440]   'cause all his essays are really good.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.720]   But saying that he covered Cosby,
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.200]   he followed him for two years,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.480]   as he was doing kind of the shaming
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.760]   of lesser cultural acts back in the day.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.720]   And he knew this stuff was going on back then,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.360]   but he chose not to deal with it,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.840]   'cause then I'd have to deal with that whole thing.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.560]   And so it's a book Mark Whitaker,
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.760]   a book biography, chose not to touch it at all.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.200]   And Tada Hissie said a day that he's had
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.880]   fewer regrets in his careers, but this is one.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.720]   'Cause in the end of the day,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.520]   you had to believe one person over 13 people,
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.280]   and he says, "I should have dealt with it."
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   And it was eloquent.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   And I think that, yes, you get Jean Gomeshi at CBC.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.120]   Somebody I knew, and there was a fan of,
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.680]   you get all these BBC men
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.520]   who've been accused of doing bad things
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.680]   with their public position.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.080]   There's, yeah, it's a big bad bro problem here.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.520]   For us men.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.360]   - It's really sad.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.840]   I thought we were making such great stuff.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.680]   - It's also true.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.080]   - It's really, it's funny.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.360]   I really, I come back and forth about this.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.520]   On one hand, I'm like, "Yeah, wow."
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.600]   We're making no progress.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.200]   This is terrible, right?
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.480]   But then it's like, "Well, maybe I just know about it more
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   because of the internet."
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.320]   - Yeah, maybe.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.440]   - And maybe the system's working.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.000]   I mean, what was his name,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.360]   the comedian that did the bit about Cosby?
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.680]   He calls him out during his bit,
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.760]   which is the thing that kind of got the momentum.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.080]   But what did he say during his bit?
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.960]   He said, "Go home and Google Cosby rape.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.600]   You'll see I'm right."
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.280]   Like that's how he backed up his claim,
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.920]   that these 13 women had, or I think like 15 now,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.760]   had accused him.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.320]   So on one hand, when I'm more depressed moments,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.840]   I think, yes, we have this huge sexism problem.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   Nothing is changing.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.040]   This is just, you know, getting worse and worse.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.520]   And then other times I think,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.920]   "You know what, the system's working.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.520]   People are getting called out.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.240]   You know, transparency, we're learning more,
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.000]   we're talking more, we're having this conversation,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   we're identifying patterns,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.120]   because we have a lot more information
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.440]   and a lot more conversation about it.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.120]   And that's how we make progress.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.880]   So I don't know, I try to be,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.680]   try to be an optimist about it.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.640]   - I mean, his show about canceled, right?
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.480]   Both shows, Netflix special and the NBC show.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.040]   - But you know, in all seriousness,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.520]   this is why you need, don't be evil.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.480]   You need to empower your employees to say,
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.720]   call you out on it and be licensed to say,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   "Should we do that?"
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.960]   - What about the fact, the chat was bringing this up,
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   that the system also allows a lot of false accusations
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.320]   and allegations that gain the power of truth,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.640]   just because they've been published
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   on the internet or on Twitter.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.480]   - Yeah.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.680]   - But don't, we have a system for really being,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.760]   you know, really determining what's true and what's not.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.280]   - Thating what's true and what's not.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.640]   - Well, I think over the long run we kind of do.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   I think that's the point is that the truth will out.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.160]   Generally, can people be, as we've talked about the show
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.440]   many, many times, can people be attacked, impersonated,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.120]   hounded, yeah, all kinds of bad things can happen.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.360]   But I think Gina's right, we have a better system
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.160]   for more checks now and for more truths to come out.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.640]   - And we have tools that empower more people
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.000]   to do that vetting, to do that checking,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.560]   than we ever have before.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.120]   And it was kind of what I was saying a couple weeks ago,
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.200]   technology is inherently good or evil, it just is, right?
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.320]   I mean, it's just tools, but yeah, I mean,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.440]   I have to believe that the truth will come out
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.080]   if people care enough, eventually.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.160]   I mean, look, I was outraged that there are that many causes.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.360]   I had no idea that these accusations were against Cosby
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.040]   until this guy did this bit, right?
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.360]   I'm thrilled that he spoke out about it
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.960]   and used his platform and that it gained steam
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.200]   and this is what's going on.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.240]   I mean, look, I don't want to crucify anybody,
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.200]   but this is what happened.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.480]   - This is why I'm, Jeff, you're doing the work of the Angels
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.160]   'cause we need, I think, what we need is journalists
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.960]   who are really high integrity journalists
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.680]   who will dig, who will try to, I mean, isn't that what,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.160]   originally what this whole point of,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   maybe actually isn't what,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.880]   originally journalism was about,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.480]   but at some point, in the modern era,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.360]   journalism started to become about people trying to find
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.400]   the objective facts, the objective truth,
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.160]   and giving that information to people
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.960]   so they could make judgments.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.360]   We've fallen far from that lofty goal.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.400]   I don't know, what do you think, Mr. Professor of Journalism?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.320]   Isn't that what, good journalism,
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.440]   I mean, originally journalism was yellow journalism, right?
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.840]   It was, it was always, until very recently,
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.880]   journalism was about arguing a--
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   - Well, Matt, Matt. - This is journalism.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.400]   - Yeah. - I mean, back before 1605,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.120]   pardon me for this Gutenberg moment,
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.240]   journalism was private information with--
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   - Made public. (laughs)
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.840]   - Well, not made public paid for.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   - Right. - And then it took from 1605
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.360]   until the Steam press in the 19th century
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.520]   before it became mass. - Right.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.600]   - Once it became mass, the idea I keep playing
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.720]   around with lately, and I have lunch with my old editor,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.080]   they started thinking about this again,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.320]   is I wanna play with the idea of the end of mass,
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.920]   and that I gave a talk at something called Newsgeist
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.440]   in Phoenix this weekend, which was a great
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.680]   unconference for my business.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.360]   And I think that the root of a lot of the problems
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.360]   that we have now in media is the reliance on mass,
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.880]   not just, I don't say that as a snob,
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.680]   I say that because it's a business problem.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.520]   It's corrupting, you go after page views,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.480]   you go after traffic, you go after
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.360]   a volume, and a volume-based business.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.120]   Journalism is a volume-based business,
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.560]   is inherently corrupted.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.760]   But I think the journalism as a service-based business
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.400]   isn't, and we see some hope there.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.080]   We see Chartbeat is working with EFT now
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.720]   to sell attention minutes, and Tony Hale,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.640]   the CEO of Chartbeat, or somebody we ought to have on
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.200]   at some point, is quite eloquent on this,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.640]   on how attention can be a better measure of quality.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.400]   That's what medium and ebb Williams are going after.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.080]   They're selling TTR, total time red.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.920]   They believe in that.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.160]   It's not the only way to get us,
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   just time spent is not necessarily a great measure,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.640]   but there are some efforts to flee to quality here.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.240]   And I think that as we flee away from mass media economics,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.720]   we may get better, but as long as we stay
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.800]   with mass media economics, it just stays pure volume.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.120]   - In other words, it promotes clickbait
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.760]   and sensationalism. - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.680]   And what we would somehow like to,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   I would somehow like to promote is maybe they used to call
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.360]   it investigative journalistic class of people who feel like,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.560]   who have kind of a calling, a higher calling
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.640]   to ferreting out the truth, the Woodward and Bernstein.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.280]   And because that's, this is the problem.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.200]   We don't, these allegations fly back and forth.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.120]   You can get a feeling, I mean, we all have a feeling
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   about Uber that doesn't feel good.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.360]   It feels like there's something wrong,
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.080]   but we don't really know.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.880]   - That's true.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.720]   - But do we trust the press to get it for us, right?
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.280]   So, so-- - Well, we don't anymore.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.200]   I mean, BuzzFeed is the press now.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.560]   - But I trust BuzzFeed then, I trust Ben Smith.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.920]   - Do you? - Watch out for us first.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.400]   - You probably know him, right?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.280]   - Well, yeah, Madam.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.120]   And I think it was BuzzFeed, I'm very critical of BuzzFeed
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.240]   as a last vestige of mass clickbait,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.040]   but the journalism, at the same time,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.640]   BuzzFeed does very good journalism,
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.960]   and Ben Smith does as well.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.880]   And, and, you know, cats are the new classifies
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.520]   that subsidize what the good journalists at BuzzFeed do.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.040]   - Yeah, I just, I'm gonna have a hard time trusting BuzzFeed
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   as a journalistic source, or vice.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.440]   - I generally believe-- - Or any of these other
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.640]   so-called journalistic sources that are driven by cats.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.120]   - I generally absolutely agree.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   And I think that's a corrupting problem,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.760]   and that's what I said in my book.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.680]   But, but then again, I think Smith himself
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.080]   is a good journalist and in this case--
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.360]   - Yeah, and vice too.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.240]   - Both, BuzzFeed and the West do some good journalism,
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.560]   but it's intermingled with crap.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   And I have a hard time-- - I actually think less so.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.880]   - Vice, I think less so.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.280]   I think vice, and by the way,
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.200]   full disclosure is on December 1st at CUNY,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.280]   where we are giving the Knight Innovation Award
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   in journalism to Shane Smith advice.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.400]   - Well, there you go.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.720]   - There you go.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.080]   I think, I think vice is reinvented itself.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.320]   You know, I think it's a very, it's a different,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.680]   the vice of today is very different than the vice.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.840]   - The vice of today is doing some really amazing reporting
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.160]   and proving that young people care about their work.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.960]   - Yeah, I mean, that's clearly what they're doing,
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.320]   is they're trying to bring young people
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   to real journalists, journalists together.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.640]   - David Carr smashed them, then did a meacopa
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.440]   and said, "No, vice is actually okay."
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.280]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.160]   - BuzzFeed, I generally agree with you though,
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.240]   there is some good stuff there.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.040]   A Vox, which I think is wonderful,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.920]   where I think it goes astray,
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.520]   is that it's still going after some volume page views,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.880]   where it should be trying to explain things,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.800]   but the business model isn't there yet.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.040]   - Well, isn't that kind of the basic problem,
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.680]   that there is no money in the kind of journalism
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.680]   that I'm asking for?
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.360]   Or is there a way to do true investigative,
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.640]   a high integrity journalism?
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.480]   - Oh, there is.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.560]   - And make a living.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.040]   - Yeah, there is, but not in the way that it was done before.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.880]   - Right.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.080]   - And at Piero Midear, his first reflex was to say,
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.640]   "Well, I need a sports section to get audience
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   to my investigative journalism."
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.240]   No, no, that's the wrong old model.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.840]   And he's not doing that now.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.920]   He's trying to figure out how to do this,
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.920]   and we're not there in the business models yet at all,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.680]   but I definitely think it's possible.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.560]   - I just think I'm just old fashioned,
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.480]   'cause I mean, you know, if you go to the top of Vice's page,
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.640]   really great, deep, investigative, and important stories.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.560]   And then as you scroll down,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.240]   they've got a lot of sugar in here
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.480]   to get you, again, the young people, particularly,
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.840]   to read it.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.320]   And--
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.160]   - Yeah, it's like broccoli wrapped in cotton candy, right?
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.600]   - And swimming dolphins with dolphins
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   really cure your method,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.080]   why do Swedish students love yelling so much?
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.440]   Put your hands in the air for world toilet day.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.080]   In my day, you wouldn't see this mixed in with good journalism,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.280]   but maybe I just have to get over that.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.120]   - I agree.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.800]   Well, the other one that bothers me most actually,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.760]   which starts with very good motives,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.840]   but ends up being very cynical as up worthy.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.400]   Highly manipulative.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.200]   - Yeah, Mom, I'm not gonna read up worthy for news.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.040]   - Well, they're trying to get young people to do just that
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.240]   because they're trying to, you know,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.320]   this will change your life.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.560]   And once you know it doesn't change your life,
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.320]   you don't believe them anymore.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.720]   - By the way, Vice has an article,
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.080]   all the reasons why Uber is the worst.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   (laughing)
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   - Oh, there you go.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.360]   (laughing)
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.480]   It's a list to go linking to all the critical journalism
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.920]   that others have done elsewhere.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.240]   - Right, that one right next to the human billboards
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.960]   of New York City, but okay.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.160]   - I mean, you know, this is interesting.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.360]   I mean, part of it is the rise of kind of social media,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.960]   the fact that people go to Facebook,
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.120]   their Facebook, no news feed,
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   and their Twitter timeline to get their news
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.840]   so they cop from things that thing.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.960]   I think Twit is so interesting to me, Leo,
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.240]   because you do long shows that do in-depth discussions,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   like the one that we're having now.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.560]   I mean, because it's, you know,
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.720]   I think your audience is primarily the audio listeners,
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.680]   right, from downloading the podcast,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   they're typically commuters or folks in the gym.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.720]   You know, people who aren't in a position
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.360]   where they can hop from, you know, one list go to another,
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.880]   one up where the curiosity gap headline from another
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.280]   on their news feed, right?
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.360]   But you kind of get this in-depth content.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.040]   I mean, I love that you are sort of,
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.000]   you're living your values by doing the shows,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.680]   the way that you do them.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.960]   But I know that, you know, when we've had this discussion,
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.560]   you know, how does video or podcasts go viral?
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.760]   They don't, right?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.600]   There's a, there's, there isn't a virality
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.800]   that can happen in this sort of medium.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.360]   There's an in-depth-ness that can happen.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.960]   And I don't really know what the answer is.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.200]   I mean, if you're an advertising-based business
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.520]   by its nature has to go after as many eyeballs as possible
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.920]   in order to support itself, right?
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   So it has to be free and it has to get,
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.920]   it has to, it has to involve getting listicles.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.240]   - If you feel it, really it has to, it has to.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.080]   - I mean, does it?
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.440]   - I, you know, I just, I, you know, I often think,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.720]   it's just a matter of time before I'm gonna have to retire
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.680]   because the world has left me behind.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.480]   And maybe I'm just too old for the-
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   (laughing)
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.320]   - No!
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.560]   (laughing)
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.920]   - I didn't mean for it to go there.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.920]   I was, I was congratulating you on doing this.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.760]   - Put the work data.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.600]   - Put the work data.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.840]   - I only retire.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.240]   - I really like it. - I need big listicles.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.080]   That's what we need, big listicles.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   - Kitten listicles.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.400]   - Kitten listicles.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.280]   - If you did this week in Cats,
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.680]   you would get two weeks traffic
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.480]   and then everyone would yell at you and abandon you.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.320]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.840]   - And the point is you have a relationship with trust
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.680]   with your audience.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.920]   They're more of an audience.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.680]   They're your friends, they're your community.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.440]   That's the future.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.920]   - And you have a super engaged audience.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.360]   I mean, look, I can't keep up with the chat room
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.400]   while we talk.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.240]   - I know.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.040]   - I mean, this is like live audience.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   It's amazing.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.280]   It's amazing what goes on here.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.680]   When I explain this to people who don't watch live,
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.640]   they're like, oh, that's crazy.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.600]   Somebody in the chat room saying,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.760]   I didn't realize there was video.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.240]   This is the first time I've ever seen video of Twig.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.400]   (laughs)
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.640]   And it doesn't Gina look adorable in her fur hoodie?
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.400]   - Oh, thanks.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.840]   It's cold here, you guys.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.920]   It's cold and I'm frightened and scared
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.120]   because Leo's retiring.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.960]   - No, I'm not.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.360]   I do that to scare the kids.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.120]   - You shop at Uniqlo, Gina.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.840]   - I've actually resisted it because it--
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.480]   - So this is, I see there's one as I drive
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.800]   to the airport in San Francisco.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.640]   It's a Chinese, no, Japanese,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.040]   and it's like the Ikea of clothes.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.800]   I love you.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.720]   - Yeah, it's like great colors.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.280]   - Really, you love Uniqlo?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.120]   - I love Uniqlo.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.560]   - It's Uniqlo.com if you want to.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.400]   - It's phenomenal.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.240]   It's just amazing.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.960]   And they have $20 hoodies and fleeces.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   And they have a--
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.120]   - It is like Ikea.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.960]   - Yeah.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.800]   - It's great.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.960]   - I have to you.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.800]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.640]   I do.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.400]   I wear the incredibly light.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.640]   They have an unbelievably light fleece.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.520]   - Is that the heat tech?
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.360]   - No, that's different.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.320]   That supposedly as you sweat warms you up.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.160]   I don't know.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.600]   - I don't like that idea.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.920]   - It's good layering, like basic layering material.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.200]   - Yeah, it's hard stuff.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.040]   - Cold.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   - Okay.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.520]   - I gotta go check this out.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.440]   I've seen it this one of the only Atlantic stuff.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.600]   - They have a really nice fuzzy hoodie there.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.440]   You'll love Gina.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.280]   - Yeah, I see, I see.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.120]   Look at this.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.840]   - Can't resist a good fuzzy hoodie.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.480]   - An outerwear outperforms the cold.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.320]   - Yeah.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.160]   - Yeah.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   (laughing)
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.920]   - Now this is sexy.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.720]   (laughing)
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.800]   - Oh, stretch down jacket.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.640]   - Ooh.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   - Dave Posh Marshmallow.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.480]   Listen, what are you saying?
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.920]   - I love those marshmallow jackets.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.320]   - I have had hair.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.160]   I'll do the whole thing.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.360]   Red nose, I don't care.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.200]   - You don't appreciate them
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   until you're in the cold and then you go, wow.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.040]   - Yeah.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.880]   - These are great.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.400]   - So real, what about you and Uber?
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.000]   - Well, like I said, I'm only written number twice.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.280]   It was in Paris.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.840]   The second time I was cheated by the driver,
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.880]   who said, I don't know, the application has crashed.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   I don't know how much you owe me.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.960]   I said, well, what should I pay you?
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.720]   - Oh, 50 euros.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.000]   - I was ripped off by, so that's the last--
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.760]   - Hey, doesn't it just charge you?
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.600]   Is it supposed to charge you?
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.160]   - Yeah, but the app had crashed.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.080]   - He said.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.680]   - Huh, it's France.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.840]   You don't expect Uber to work in France, do you?
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.680]   - He'll do.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.840]   He snowed you.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.640]   - He snowed me.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.840]   And what am I gonna do?
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.640]   I'm not, I can't, well, I'm not gonna pay you.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.760]   I didn't wanna do that.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.680]   So I just get, I threw 50 euros at him and ran.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.080]   - In France, I can see if it was a language issue,
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.000]   which there would be for me.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.920]   I could see how using an app would be a lot easier
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.760]   than money to get.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.080]   - And Uber had just come to Paris.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.560]   This was at Le Webb.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.640]   And then, we don't have Uber up here.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.920]   - Although, I think Jennifer uses Uber a lot.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.240]   I think there are, I know people who use Uber a lot,
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.680]   I guess when they go to San Francisco.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.800]   Do you use it, Jason, in San Francisco?
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.880]   - No, I've never used Uber, although I will say
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.640]   we had Phil Nickinson and Matteo Doni on all that Android
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.480]   a couple weeks ago.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.320]   - They came up.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.920]   - And they came and went back using Uber.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.800]   They were able to get Uber here in Sonoma.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.040]   - Yeah, you can, you can press the button and says,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.120]   well, there'll be an Uber car there in an hour and a half.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.480]   - Yeah, they wait 10 minutes.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   And it was here pretty fast.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.080]   - Oh, maybe it's here now.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.120]   Well, I ain't, no, but I don't want to take Lyft either.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.080]   That looks weird.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.520]   So.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.000]   - That mustache thing.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.760]   - I don't want to pink mustache on my car.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.600]   - It's not really my vibe.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.240]   - I like yellow cabs.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.360]   I just like a yellow cab.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.240]   That's all I want, just a yellow cab.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.800]   - Although at some point, they installed screens
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.000]   that, in yellow cabs here, in New York.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.280]   - They do all this tires, is it's male Michael Bloomberg
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.720]   and welcome in.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.760]   - Yeah, yeah, and it's the worst touchscreen ever
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.640]   and you have to jab out it to turn it off a million times.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.120]   - That was a great episode of The Good Wife
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.720]   from like the season ago.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.760]   I'm catching up on when our doublazio wouldn't shut up
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.600]   in the cab.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.440]   (laughing)
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.800]   - Yes, I remember that one.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.840]   I remember when an In fact,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.760]   Uber was just on the last episode without giving anything away.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.600]   I know you're watching it now,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.040]   but there was an Uber mention on the last episode
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.960]   of The Good Wife, which is a fantastic, fantastic show,
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.360]   just in terms of technology references.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.880]   But yeah, there was a moment where they were like,
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.720]   did you take a cab?
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.640]   Yeah, I took an Uber and they were like,
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.240]   give me your phone, we want to see the route you took.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.440]   - Oh. - Oh.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.160]   - Yeah, yeah, so.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.000]   I was like, oh.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.920]   - The Good Wife seems to be really up
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.160]   on all of the latest issues of privacy and so forth.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.800]   - Oh, it's a great show. - I don't watch it.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.880]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a fake Google, Chumhum,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.920]   is the name of the search engine in the show
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   and there's this ongoing case of like Chumhum, you know,
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.760]   whatever, being a monopoly, basically,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.480]   using their powers to rank results
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.120]   in the search engine unfairly.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.160]   - Oh, wow.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.000]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, oh, they're ripped case,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.360]   they ripped, you know, situations directly from the news.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.000]   - Tony Wang has just-- - For the last season,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.080]   was the last season, before, like,
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.680]   his last season was the NSA snoops.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.800]   - Yes.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.440]   - Ooh. - Yeah.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.360]   - Would you watch it, Leo?
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.640]   - No, I've never seen it.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.600]   - I have, I have, I thought that I gave up on it
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.000]   because I missed like the first six episodes
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.240]   that I'll never catch up.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.600]   I've now binge watching last season to this season
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.440]   and then from the beginning,
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.600]   I'm gonna watch the whole damn thing.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.640]   - Oh, I intentionally miss episodes
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.040]   'cause I wanna binge watch everything.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.920]   I don't wanna-- - It's great.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.360]   - Yeah, I highly recommend.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.160]   And one of the NSA snoops was,
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.880]   is the guy who plays Jared and Silicon Valley on HBO.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   - Yeah. - Oh.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.120]   - Yes, it's great.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   - He is also one of the voices in "Big Hero 6."
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.560]   Is it Jared?
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.720]   It's the guy with a funny weird beard.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.520]   - Oh, no.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.120]   Jared was the business manager guy,
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.440]   the guy that got stuck out on the barge.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.360]   - Love him. - Or not the barge.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.160]   - Love him. - Yeah, the barge.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.000]   - Yeah, he's great. - He's great.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.200]   - He's also in that, in the loop,
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.040]   that wonderful movie based on the thick of it.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.720]   - Anyway, I'm sorry, where are we going here?
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.560]   We're gonna take a break. - Yeah, we're talking.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.680]   - So Jeff can go answer the door.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.440]   He has been told his Nexus 6 is on the truck.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.880]   - I keep on refreshing.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.040]   It's like refreshing, do I have a new operating system?
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.640]   Refreshing, do I have a new phone?
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.120]   - And thanks to Tony Wang,
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.440]   I'm gonna have a tool of the week this week
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.640]   that comes from Uniqlo.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.080]   - Oh. - How do you like that?
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.280]   How do you like them apples?
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.320]   That's a little later on.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.920]   Yeah, you know what's weird, 'cause Jason Howell,
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.680]   host of all that Android and our producer today,
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.920]   was the guy who was refreshing,
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.840]   like right and left, right and right, left on the day
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.480]   that the Nexus 6 went online and available
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.840]   and was got in in the first 30 seconds and bought one.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.880]   So you got it sooner than anybody else.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.600]   I, some weeks later, learned that every Wednesday,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.640]   they put a few more on sale
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   and I was able to snag one on the Play Store.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.680]   But Jeff, where did you get yours?
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.840]   - Motorola. - Motorola.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   - Okay, yes. - Two Twig fans on Twitter.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.160]   Oh god bless you both, alerted me.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.160]   I went on, I seemed to have bought it at the very end.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.480]   I'll leave that item in your check
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.120]   and your cat wanted to call it.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.680]   Cart is no longer for sale, as opposed to it.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.040]   So I just refreshed and I had two
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.320]   and I tried to delete the right one and bull my hat it
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.120]   and it's on a truck, it's on, it's in New Jersey.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.360]   It's in New Jersey.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.160]   So of all, it's odd because Jeff ordered it
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.200]   the most recently and he's gonna get his first.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   - He's gonna get his. - He's gonna get his.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.760]   - You're gonna get yours. - Mine's on its way.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.560]   It's his order of the week after mine.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.400]   I was there at the front gates and I got in
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.040]   and I'm waiting, it hasn't even shipped.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   - I'm just saying there's just no rhyme reason here.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.080]   - And my ship from China,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.000]   mine ship from Lexington, Kentucky.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.480]   - Ah.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.160]   - Oddly enough, they're all coming on UPS, right?
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.120]   No yours is FedEx. - Go FedEx.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.160]   - Mine's UPS.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.480]   And Jason's ships on Thursday.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.200]   - I'm convinced mine's never coming.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.440]   Mine's just never gonna come, so weird.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.760]   - My kibber shouldn't have.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.480]   - The T-Mobile has it now as well.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.360]   - Yes, everybody has it.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.160]   - Well, don't worry, everybody has it.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.560]   - I'm starting to, you know, we had Kevin Tofelon last week.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.200]   He had his, I'm starting to hear that the battery life,
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.120]   like on all these QHD displays,
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.440]   these quad HD displays is not the greatest.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.600]   - Really?
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.520]   - Stick with your OnePlus One.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.440]   - This OnePlus One battery life really is unbelievable.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.640]   - It's unbelievable. - It is just phenomenal.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.120]   - I think we have a clear winner in battery life
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.000]   and it's OnePlus One.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.840]   - Oh boy, do we?
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.240]   It sets the standard for battery life.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.440]   - It's 'cause it's a 1080p screen.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.040]   - If any of these big screen guys were 1080p, be fine.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.520]   But they decided, well, we got more battery.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.280]   Let's throw more pixels at it.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.640]   - More power, more power.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.760]   - And I'm curious if Lollipop's gonna make that better or not.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.640]   I mean, theory Lollipop does, but I'm curious.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.440]   - Speaking of Lollipop, did either of you
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.080]   get it on your Nexus 7?
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.040]   - Nope.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.880]   - Nope.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.080]   - I dug up my Nexus 7, which is the original Nexus 7.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.800]   So, and I just, I hadn't looked at it in a while.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.560]   That thing is just slow.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   Like it's just slow.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.760]   It had a ton of updates to get through,
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.480]   but it's stuttery and slow and--
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.560]   - Well, the little I did, I put mine in my briefcase
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.320]   next to a magnet and it was pixels.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.480]   - No.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.880]   - Oh no.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.080]   - And I love this thing so much.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.200]   I ordered another one before they go off stock.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.880]   - I have my second generation here.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.440]   I brought it in, keeping it charged on wireless.
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.040]   I love Qi charging, by the way.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.120]   You gotta love that.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.120]   And so just sitting on the dock there
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.960]   and every once in a while I check.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.720]   We know now though, thanks to a post on Reddit
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.680]   by a Google engineer, the story of the updates.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.080]   And I will tell you the story of the updates
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.440]   when we come back.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.880]   Why you are getting an update, but you aren't
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.840]   and so forth and so on.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.680]   - Oh.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.520]   - Yeah.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.000]   We now know the truth about all of this.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.360]   But first a word from our friends.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.000]   It's smart things.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.720]   Smart things was a wonderful Kickstarter project
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.800]   to create a hub for your smart home
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.680]   that would understand everything you have in the smart home
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.680]   and allow you to set up a smart automated system
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.320]   without a lot of must and fuss to give you home security
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.480]   to allow you to control things like your lights
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.920]   and your music.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.680]   Smart things is so cool.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.000]   Get a notification of someone you don't know
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.480]   tries to enter your house or get an alert
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.920]   to prevent a small leak from becoming a major flood.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.560]   Yes, they have moisture sensors.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.640]   Control and automate your lights and your small appliances
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.760]   wherever you go.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.600]   Stay connected to your family by getting notifications
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.760]   of when people come and go and protect valuable items
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   and secure areas that are off limits.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.960]   Smart things is so cool.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.040]   And of course you control it all with a mobile app
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.080]   on your iPhone or your Android device.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.520]   They have a huge number of sensors,
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:37.520]   but it all starts with the hub, the smart things hub.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.880]   In fact, a great way to start is to work with the kits
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.960]   that they offer. They have a variety of kits available,
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   security kits, but also kits designed to get things done
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.400]   like the water detection kit I mentioned,
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   which has the sensors that will detect moisture.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.440]   You can get instant push or text notifications
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.680]   whenever moisture is found in a particular area,
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.640]   basement, a stairwell, a laundry room.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.160]   You can monitor temperatures if you're worried about
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.600]   the pipes freezing in your cabin or your Brooklyn home.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.360]   You can have notifications there.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.760]   And this is the nicest thing about smart things.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.960]   If you've got a Nest thermostat or a Honeywell or an Eon,
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   it talks to those too.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.960]   So you can use the smart things hub and the smart things units
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:32.640]   but you can also use Dropcam, Sonos, the Philips Hue,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.440]   Logitech, and of course your Nest thermostat.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.880]   Furthermore, for your developer,
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.520]   you can also create new ways to use smart things
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.040]   and publish them for everyone else to use.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.640]   It works with if, then, then that.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.440]   I can just go on and on.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.600]   It works with your Schlage locks, your Quick Set locks,
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.640]   your train heating system, your Sonos, your Foscam,
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.320]   your Belkin, with your Y things.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.400]   Now we've got solution kits starting at $170 for Twit fans.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.520]   Home security kits starting at $350.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.320]   Each of them, of course, starts with the hub
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.640]   and then has the devices you need
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.040]   to add additional capabilities.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.800]   You'll be getting a smart home in less than 15 minutes,
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.760]   plus free shipping within the US.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.680]   Smartthings.com/Twit, and the deal is use the offer code
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.120]   TWIT10 at checkout to get 10% off any home security
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.560]   or solution kit.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   TWIT10, TWIT10 at checkout smartthings.com/Twit.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.400]   I just, it's such a good solution.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.600]   Did you get your Kickstarter reward yet?
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   Didn't you buy it on a, on a.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.280]   I did. I backed the Kickstarter.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.120]   It was a while ago.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.800]   It was like September, it was like 2012.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.640]   So you got it.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.480]   A couple years ago.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.320]   Yeah, so I got my kit a long time ago.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.160]   And in fact, I'm pretty sure the version that I got
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.120]   is at a date at this point in the one they're shipping.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.640]   So it was an early prototype.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.240]   Oh, it's so much improved, yeah.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.320]   It's awesome.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.040]   I love smartthings from the get go.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:54.880]   I had it hooked up.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.200]   I think I told you I had it hooked up to my mailbox,
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.280]   my postal mailbox outside.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.600]   When the mail got dropped in,
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.680]   I got a push notification on my phone, which was awesome.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.080]   So awesome.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.200]   Yeah, it's a great, it's a great product.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.440]   Or when the FedEx guy throws your Nexus 6 over the fence.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.000]   Exactly.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Yeah, then you'll know it's here.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.600]   Katie has just arrived home from school.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.200]   This is so cool.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.640]   So she has in her backpack, the little thing that's,
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.280]   that's a present sensor.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.000]   And you'll get a text message when your,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.640]   when your kids arrive back from school,
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.480]   that kind of thing.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.840]   It's just so neat.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.920]   Yeah, I had one on that at a stroller.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   So I knew what you knew that.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.400]   Fuck.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.920]   Yeah, it's really, it's the coolest thing ever.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.680]   I don't know what this guy's doing, but.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.160]   (laughs)
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.680]   SmartThings.com/twit.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:42.400]   Yeah, so a good posting by a Google engineer on Reddit.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.280]   Kind of cleared up a little bit.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.480]   You know, so many people, and it's still happening now,
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.960]   we're so anxious to get Android 5.0 Lollipop on their Nexus 5,
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.880]   their Nexus 4, their Nexus 7, their Motorola X,
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.640]   that they were downloading the, you know, the jar files
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.840]   and trying to install them.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.840]   And he posted PSA, "Do not clear data
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.720]   for Google service framework."
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.560]   He said, "So a lot of people are doing this apparently,
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.160]   and it just screws everything up.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.960]   But, but further more explained that here's how
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   these rollouts work.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.960]   Did I explain this last week?
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:22.800]   No.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.640]   I explained it on Twit.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.480]   Yeah, yeah on Twit.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.840]   I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself, I'm getting old.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.160]   So what, what he said is one per se, so here's how it works.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.400]   They've got the new Lollipop 5.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.840]   It has been tested.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.800]   The releases are out.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.440]   They've even released the, you know, the full APK,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.480]   or I guess it's a jar file for each of the phones.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.960]   So if you really, you know, wanted to, you can install it.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.520]   But don't.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.200]   What they do first, they roll it out to 1% randomly.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.640]   And he said, "It doesn't matter how much you press refresh."
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.400]   Remember we were wondering last week if actually pressing
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.880]   refresh could screw it up, you know, asking too many times
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.120]   can I have the update?
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.280]   He said, "It doesn't matter."
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.280]   He said, "You're either on the bus or off the bus.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.960]   If you're on the bus, you're in the 1% you'll get it.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.040]   If not, you can refresh as many times you want.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:10.880]   You're not going to get it.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.720]   And it's not going to make it any worse.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.520]   Because if there are no big massive bugs,
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.280]   we've heard a couple, but I don't think there are any
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.720]   massive bugs in the next week, and this is the next week.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.480]   Now I think 25% will get it.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.400]   Oh, that's a big jump.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:32.520]   So now 26% of all owners of Moto Xs or Nexus 5s or Nexus 4s
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.720]   probably should have Lollipop or we'll get it in the next day or so.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.800]   The next jump is another 25% and then the final 25%.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.720]   So it takes-- it's three or four weeks to roll out the whole thing.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.480]   And there's nothing you can do.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.160]   You can't force the update.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.040]   You could sideload it.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.920]   But it seems to me sideloading causes some issues.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.480]   Yeah, I mean, I guess I guess 1% is actually
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.640]   quite a few users.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.560]   And it makes sense that they would stage the rollout.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.120]   And honestly, maybe you don't want
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.520]   to be in the 1%-- the co--
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.560]   the container, the coal mine, the people.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.320]   Because with software, really you can test and test and test.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.960]   This is a lesson I have to learn over and over again.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.440]   You don't see the bug, but the bug doesn't happen
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.920]   until actual users get it.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.800]   And then you want to jump off a cliff.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.160]   So that makes sense that they do 1%.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.040]   Although we were saying last night on all about Android, or at least I was saying,
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:28.960]   I wish that Google could just detect the people who are manually tapping check
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.400]   now, because those are the people who really care and really want it.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.080]   And they could just win so many hearts by putting those people on the 1%.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:37.720]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.240]   Or the first 25%.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.880]   There ought to be a fans club that--
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.760]   If you're a loyal user, you get early take on it.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.400]   If I've bought every damn Nexus product there, I have and I have.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.800]   And if you happen to have written a kiss,
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.240]   I ask, "Look, I'm going to ask, 'What about the company?'
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.240]   And I have."
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   At least you get the stuff early.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.040]   Yeah, like some sort of opt-in.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.240]   Yeah, super fans.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.040]   But, well, and this is all companies do this.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.080]   You can be a super fan, you know, if you get in the beta program or whatever,
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.120]   but understand, you're also--
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.040]   You're also, you know, cannon fodder.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.360]   You're the first one over the hill.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.360]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.360]   That's true.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.360]   Right.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   Right.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   And maybe they don't want us--
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   They want a super fan of states.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   Yeah, just stay happy.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.960]   Be talking about the buggy, at least they got.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   Exactly.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.440]   Don't upgrade to Lollipop.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:28.280]   It's really buggy, you know, that's-- it's dangerous.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:31.200]   This one is from Jeff Jarvis, I'm guessing.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.600]   At two Google.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:39.320]   Google now joins dumb TV news reports on what we've long known.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.800]   Thanksgiving holiday traffic.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.440]   Are they going to have somebody standing?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   What's it called?
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   A stand-outer?
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   A stand-out?
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   A stand-up?
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   A stand-up.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.440]   A stand-up.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   Somebody standing in front of--
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.960]   I'm standing in front of I-5 and it's a mess.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.960]   All right.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.960]   It's like the--
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.360]   It went through all this magnificent data and they tell us,
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   "Guess what?
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.360]   Wednesday has a lot of traffic."
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.360]   So Google.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   But you got them at the infographic.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.360]   Or one of them is going to shop on the day after Thanksgiving.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.520]   Why don't you tell me that?
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.240]   The infographic is well done.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.400]   Right?
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   But in interestingly, Boston is Tuesday.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.040]   Honolulu is Saturday.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.960]   It providence is Saturday.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.280]   And San Francisco is Saturday.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.000]   So there are exceptions.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.480]   Yeah, they're fine, fine, fine.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.240]   If you must leave on Wednesday, skip the rush.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   This is just an infographic exercise.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.600]   Yeah, that's all it is.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.280]   We actually had fun on Monday.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:34.240]   If you get a chance to watch "Tryingulation," I interviewed
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.560]   Gareth Cokos, the author of "The Best Infographics of 2014."
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.880]   And there's some really good ones.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.040]   We talked about bad infographics, clickbait infographics, and all of that.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.960]   But there's some really nice.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.560]   It can be done well.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.200]   Good news for local travelers.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.280]   Thanksgiving day traffic is a breeze.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.120]   And they have a turkey in a car.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.960]   Yeah, the turkey's trying to get away from the table.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   Run!
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   Run!
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.400]   Get me out of here.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.760]   It says, Thanksgiving day traffic is a breeze.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.800]   It usually has the least traffic of the entire week.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.320]   For traffic gurus looking to best, even the lightest traffic days,
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.840]   make sure you stay off the road between noon and 2
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.440]   on Thanksgiving day.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.400]   That's not clear.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.840]   I don't understand what they're saying.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.320]   Even the lightest--
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.920]   Actually, that's crappy, whatever they wrote there, because I don't understand what I'm
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.320]   supposed to do.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.760]   Stay off the road between noon and 2.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   It's the best day for good traffic.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:35.520]   Let me read this again.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.800]   Thanksgiving day traffic is a breeze.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:41.760]   It usually has the least traffic in the entire week.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.200]   And it's a semi-colon.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:50.160]   For the traffic gurus looking to best, even the lightest traffic days,
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.120]   make sure you stay off the road between noon and 2 on Thanksgiving day.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.800]   So they're saying, on the best day, the worst at two hours and between 12 and 2.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.160]   Thank you for translating.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.160]   Right.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.160]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.360]   See, this is the intelligence.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.920]   The intelligence that you bring to think up.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.440]   Try that part.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.600]   What the hell these people are saying in 140 characters?
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.120]   I don't understand.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.240]   My basically my entire full-time job is trying to come up with a sentence that someone would
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:18.440]   say maybe a conversation expressing what a piece of data means.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   That's not easy.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.360]   Hey, you're doing a deal, by the way.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.120]   We should mention this.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.880]   What's the website I should go to?
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   Thank you.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.280]   It's goodwebbundle.com.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.920]   We're doing a holiday promotion.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:36.840]   Think up, got together with four of our favorite sites, milkshake, meta-filter, the toast,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.840]   and newsblur.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:42.800]   We're offering something similar to humble bundle, not affiliated with humble bundle,
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.760]   but similar to humble bundle in that you can buy a one-year membership to all of these
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:54.320]   sites in one shot for $96, which sounds like a lot of money, but if you pay for the normal
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.920]   price outside of the bundle, it would be almost $200.
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.400]   It's about 50% off.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.440]   These are just a bunch of sites.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.000]   Given the Uber story and the model of startup that's super funded and just trying to take
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.400]   over the world using all these crazy tactics, I think there are still a lot of small businesses
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.360]   on the web that are run through donations and through subscriptions, and I count my company
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.920]   as one of those.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.120]   This is one way to support sites like that.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.600]   Hopefully, one of these sites you've never heard of before, you'll discover something
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.800]   good.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.640]   If you buy the bundle, you get a coupon code, you can use it all to five sites.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.920]   If you already have a membership, you can give it away to a friend.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.320]   You can give it a gift for your online hero.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.640]   It's goodwebbundle.com.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.960]   It's a one-time deal, a year's membership to five really great sites.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.960]   Thanks for letting me plug it.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   What's the update on Metafilter?
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.640]   Wasn't Matt going to retire it or something?
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   What happened?
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.840]   Metafilter had...
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.360]   It actually just redesigned.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   Look how beautiful it looks.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   It looks amazing.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.800]   It needed this a little bit.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.440]   It hadn't changed much in years.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   It did.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.800]   Metafilter's a really interesting story of how Google ranking really affects a business.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.000]   Metafilter was actually...
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.800]   They were a case study for Google AdSense.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.560]   Google made them a case study and there was a page on Google describing how great Metafilter
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.120]   did in terms of running Google Ads.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.920]   They made some changes to their algorithm.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.520]   They started to de-rank older pages.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.280]   Ask Metafilter, for example, is a fantastic resource.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.600]   There were threads that were old that were certainly content that was perfectly good,
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.240]   but the pages were just older, had an update in a while, and they got de-ranked.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   Their revenue took a big hit.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:50.080]   Matt had to size down his staff and he did a donation push earlier this year.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.080]   They got back on their feet and they did this beautiful redesign, which you can see.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.400]   I think they even launched a new TV centric Metafilter site.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400]   It's great.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.400]   It's doing well.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.240]   It's on stable ground right now.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   And really, yeah, fanfare.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   That's the new Metafilter site.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.400]   All the Metafilter sites are great.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.520]   I mean, this is a site that's been around.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.680]   Matt was running Metafilter on a single box underneath his desk back when he was working
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.520]   on Blogger in 1999.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.680]   This is an old school.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.840]   He's always run it independently with a staff of moderators.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.200]   All these sites do read the comments.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.440]   None of these sites tolerate abusive behavior.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440]   There's fantastic conversations going on here.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.440]   It's a small Metafilter.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.360]   It's been so good for so many years.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.160]   It's such a great, well-moderated, fairly-moderated, and ardently-moderated community.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   It's fantastic.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:43.160]   We're really happy that they're in the bundle with us and they're a fantastic site too.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.160]   So you'll be basically buying a supporting membership, which is great.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160]   Exactly, right.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.720]   So on Metafilter, each site you get a little something different.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.560]   On Metafilter, you get a little, you know, I'm a supporting member badge on your account.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.520]   Most people can see that you help on the site.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:05.280]   But through the bundle, you can get that at half the normal suggested donation amount
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   for a year.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   So yeah.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.840]   That's awesome.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.040]   And the random thing is fun because it's their entire life of Metafilter.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.080]   So there's stuff from the year 2000.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080]   That's crazy.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.680]   It's been around 14 years.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.680]   I did more than that, I think.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   More than that.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.080]   And it's amazing, it's a really amazing case study of what a dude who started a first-group
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.000]   blog can do built an entire career and business all around.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.040]   One of the years, only back earlier days, he had existential crises at various points
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.000]   in the life of Metafilter and has kept going on with value added.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.440]   It really is a great story, as you said, about how you can adapt to these changes.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.240]   And Matt, he really has reckoned with some of the hardest moments.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.800]   I think there are a few moments of being shut down.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.600]   He had offers to be bought, which he never did.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.760]   He is the guru on great community moderation.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.960]   And he struggled with ads and he struggled with dealing with what a change to Google's
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.800]   algorithm can do to his business.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.400]   And he's really come out on top and it's amazing community.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.440]   It's really old school, amazing community.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.440]   You know, I can tell how much I like Metafilter because unfortunately, I'm starting to read
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   the articles.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]   You right now.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]   I'm going to read that.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.240]   Oh, yeah, well, that's going to...
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.640]   All right, anyway, that's...
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:33.000]   So if you want to support a lot of really great stuff, the Good Web Bundle would be a
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   great holiday gift.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.520]   And if you already have a think-up subscription as I do, you can give that offer code to somebody
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.520]   else.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.520]   Exactly.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.520]   You can unbundle the bundle for money-sus-box.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520]   Exactly.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.840]   If you only want two of the sites, you take the two you want and you can give the other
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840]   two away.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.840]   And you're supporting some really great sites.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.480]   I was looking at Milkshake before the show.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.480]   That's fun.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.720]   Yeah, Milkshake is really fun.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.520]   Milkshake is one of those undersung heroes.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   I know.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.520]   Never heard of them.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.520]   I know you know about it.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   Yeah, yeah, you haven't heard about, right?
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.080]   It's made by my husband and wife, Team Andre and Amber.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.840]   It's just got so much personality and fun.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.840]   So awesome.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.360]   Yeah, it's really well designed and actually, Andre is at Slack now.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.920]   Oh, yeah, there's some great content there.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.280]   And so we're really happy to team up with them as well.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280]   I don't know.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:22.720]   Oh, there's a little layout of Milkshake.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   I love Milkshake.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.240]   So Milkshake is like people put images up and share them.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.040]   It's kind of like Pinterest for images, but it's got a kind of wicked sense of humor.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.680]   You create a shake and it's a stream of images.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.040]   And the community that's attracted just happens to be really big on animated GIFs and really
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.880]   kind of funny, quirky, humorous images.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.080]   I'm going to buy this bundle.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.760]   Because already that's three sites now I love.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   I got it.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.360]   This is awesome and a great site for discovery.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.240]   So our show today brought to you by prosper.com.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:02.040]   It actually is a great, this is Silicon Valley's answer to going in the bank with a hat and
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.240]   hand for a loan and you got to put on a tire and you got to look nice.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.680]   And Prosper is a way to get money, to borrow money.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.960]   Without doing any of that, it's a peer to peer lending marketplace connecting people
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.840]   who are looking to borrow money with people who have money to lend.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840]   Such a great idea.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:24.560]   If you go to prosper.com/twit, right now you'll be able to fill out a quick application and
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.400]   find out exactly how much money you can get and what your rate will be.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.200]   There aren't a lot of ways to borrow money when you need it.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.920]   I guess you could go to friends and family or a credit card.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.320]   That's a bad idea.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   Or go to the bank.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:42.280]   But now with a low fixed rate loan from prosper.com, you can pay off those high rate credit cards.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.000]   You can fix up your house for the holidays.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.920]   You can put it into your business or start a business.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.400]   Borrow up to $35,000 in as few as five days and use the money as you need.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.000]   These are fixed rate loans, multi-year terms available.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.120]   No collateral needed.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.080]   They're personal loans.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.720]   Prosper is an online marketplace connecting people who need money with those who want to
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   invest.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.240]   Don't rack up more debt on your credit cards as holiday season.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.680]   Pay them off with prosper.com.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.480]   Check your rate without affecting your good credit.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.160]   Go to prosper.com/twit.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.280]   And for a limited time, Prosper is offering Twit viewers a $50 Visa prepaid card when
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.000]   you get a loan.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Prosper.com/twit.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.800]   That's a special site just for you.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   Prosper.com/twit.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.640]   Up to $35,000 in just five days plus that $50 Visa prepaid card.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.120]   It's waiting for you at prosper.com/twit.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.320]   And now it's time for the gold change log.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:46.880]   Here's Gina Travani with the latest from Google.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.440]   This is something I'm really excited about.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.040]   I love Google Keep.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:54.800]   A fantastic note taking app with a fantastic widget, works on Android or the web.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   Well, one of the most requested features that they get for Keep just rolled out, you
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.920]   can now share notes and collaborate in real time on Keep notes.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.360]   This is really awesome, you guys.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.080]   If you need a share or grocery list with your--
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.080]   That's exactly what I want to use this for.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.080]   Yes, exactly.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.400]   And it checks it off as you're in the store buying stuff.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.240]   Lisa will see that I got it.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.240]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   Very, very cool stuff.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240]   Oh, man.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240]   I instantly, instantly shared.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.720]   Way back in the day.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.560]   I worked with a German company that was going to do that on the web.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.640]   This is called Back 1999.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.040]   And it was always a great idea.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.040]   Now it's finally done.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.520]   Yeah, I make it to do app.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.920]   There's tons of apps out there that let you collaborate.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.400]   There's no taking apps and there's list apps.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.320]   I have to say, I love Keep because it's tied to your Google account.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   It's really lightweight.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.320]   It lets you do-- I actually use Evernote and Keep.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.480]   But it's great just for collaborating without asking somebody.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.200]   I mean, I guess you do have to download the Keep app.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.360]   But you don't have to sign up.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.680]   It's just really, really simple and easy and lightweight.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.920]   You can add checkboxes, remove checkboxes.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.360]   So the sharing collaboration is really, really nice.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.640]   You can also filter your notes by color.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.440]   Because you can change the notes to your color,
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.720]   whether or not they have images or audio, whether or not they're shared.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.120]   So it's easy for you to sort out your notes and see the ones that you're sharing with
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.160]   your business-- coworkers or better half or whatever.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.960]   So really nice.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.320]   And it's got that reminder built in.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.080]   Love Keep.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:26.600]   Love Keep.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.240]   I feel like Keep is one of Google's most undersung products, actually.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:30.760]   Right.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.400]   You're right.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.680]   A couple of other little nice upgrades.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.640]   Google's search results on mobile now let you know if the site is mobile friendly.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.080]   OK.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.640]   So if you do search and you get your search results on your phone,
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   on your mobile device, you'll see a little label that says mobile friendly.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.760]   If the site that it's linking to is mobile friendly, it looks good on your--
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.000]   Does it mean it's a mobile site or it's just if mobile responsive, would that count?
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.840]   Yeah, I think that response would count.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:09.520]   And I would love to know the story behind how they're automatically detecting this, actually.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.920]   So yeah, it doesn't appear to be just sites that have an mmobile.whatever.com.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.720]   Because that's kind of not the modern web anymore now.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720]   It is the modern web.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.000]   The modern web is sites that are responsive and just change the screen.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.160]   It does not appear to be that.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.440]   So really nice way to kind of choose what sites you go through based on whether or not
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.080]   they're going to look good on your phone.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.480]   Similar change, weather is now in Google Maps.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.040]   So I tried this out with a couple of places and got mixed results.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.800]   I searched for London, England, like in the screenshot there.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.320]   And I didn't see the weather, but then I searched for Brooklyn, New York.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.680]   And I did get the weather.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.440]   Anyway, it's a little Google Now style card right below the place you search for.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.760]   That'll tell you what the weather is there.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.920]   So I can look at places in California and be jealous of how sunny and gorgeous it is
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.320]   there while I shiver here in Brooklyn.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.200]   I think it was last week that I talked about our two weeks ago.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.960]   I talked about how you have Google search on mobile now has you.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.200]   You can flip a coin to it.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.560]   OK, Google flip a coin.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.960]   I'll flip a coin for you.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.000]   There's a couple of other ones there.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   It didn't work.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.280]   I think when we tried it live on the show because we hadn't gotten the update yet.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.280]   It does work for me now.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.120]   Leo probably still does for you, does for you as well.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.760]   There's also roll a tie.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.040]   So Google will roll this excited die for you.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040]   Well, they will.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040]   Oh, God.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.720]   Oh, not a 20 sided though.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720]   I can't.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.160]   No, I wonder I didn't try roll a 20 sided die.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.480]   We should maybe maybe try that.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.480]   OK, Google.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.720]   Let me see if we can roll a 20 sided die.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   Hello.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.160]   Yeah, activated.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.040]   Roll a 20.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   OK, Google.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   Oh, shut up.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.400]   I just my timing is everything.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:58.520]   Roll a 20 sided die.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.080]   No, so close.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.560]   I was so sure that was a real die.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.400]   You know, I'm using a galaxy note.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.480]   Maybe that Google is just not up to date.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.800]   I don't know what's going on now.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.240]   Oh, it's translating thinking, thinking, parking, can't reach Google at the moment.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   Whoa.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.400]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   Roll a die.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   I don't like to say.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.680]   No, it didn't work.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   You mustn't have gotten the update.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   Sorry about that.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   Let's see.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   I did the same thing I did to last week.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.920]   The other thing that you could do, Game of Thrones fans, just Google Hoder.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.160]   It'll talk back to you.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160]   I love that.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   Hoder.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.160]   Is it working this week?
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160]   We tried last week.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   It didn't work.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160]   It did.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.320]   It worked for me this time around.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.320]   Help me.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   I'll be one, Kenobi.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.840]   Oh, see now my watch is listening.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.800]   It's so confusing.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   Help me, Obi-Wan.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.240]   And then the phone gets kind of snarky and says, "You shouldn't be talking to me while
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.080]   your watch is listening."
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.120]   Okay, there you go.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.120]   Hoder.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.120]   Hoder.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   Hoder.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.120]   Hoder.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   Love Hoder.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.120]   And then the Hoder.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.840]   Anyway, so I'm a sucker for these Easter eggs.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.280]   These are ways to impress your friends and family and Thanksgiving, folks.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.280]   So there you go.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.280]   Google tricks.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   Google tricks for turkey day.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   Who's Hoder?
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280]   What's Hoder?
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280]   What?
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.280]   What are you talking about?
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   Hoder.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.760]   Oh, that's all I got.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.360]   And that's the Google change log.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   Hoder.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.480]   That's kind of, you know, I think that that Hoder thing, people aren't going to know what
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.840]   that means in a few years.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.720]   Yeah, it's probably a fleeting.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720]   Do they still have the cling on?
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.120]   I think they probably still have Google and cling on.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   And that's another one.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.320]   That's just kind of a nerdy fun.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.160]   Hoder for those who don't know is a character in Game of Thrones that can say, but one thing
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.120]   and that thing is Hoder.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.120]   It's also his name.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.120]   Yeah, they should.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.120]   They should do it for Groot.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   Groot.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120]   Same thing.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   I am Groot.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   I am Groot.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.120]   That's all he can say.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.120]   But he says it in such expressive way.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.720]   You know what he's talking about.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.960]   By the way, Ingress is two years old.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.760]   Whoa, time flies.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:11.760]   I know.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.680]   Remember we were all like, I want to get an invite.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.240]   I want to play Ingress.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.840]   All of our staffers play Ingress and log miles.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.640]   Miles.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.440]   Playing the thing.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   It's crazy.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.960]   In fact, here's the infographic.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:32.440]   Hypothesis, Google GPS based game, cracking the code on healthier lifestyle, urban exploration
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.200]   and discovery, 200 plus countries, 64 million resonators deployed.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.560]   That's part of the game is deploying resonators.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.160]   78 million portals visited.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.720]   Are the portals all geographic locations?
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.280]   They must be, right?
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.520]   52,000 event attendance.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.080]   127 million kilometers walked.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.160]   Ingress as you play it logs your distance traveled.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.000]   So that's pretty awesome.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   Pretty awesome.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.560]   Yeah, that's pretty great for them.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.560]   Oh, I get it.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.040]   The portals created 178 million visited.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.040]   I'm even more overwhelmed by the thought of playing Ingress now than I was two years
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.240]   ago when it was introduced.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.920]   It seems like a world that I just don't know that I'm willing to commit to.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.520]   That's what happens.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:30.400]   If you got in at the beginning, Jeff Needles plays it and he walks miles.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   Padre plays it.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:38.000]   It's really kind of, at the whole time when we first saw this, we thought we surmised
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.560]   it was some sort of Google plan to gather location information.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   In fact, I think it was a Google plan to get everybody walking.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   Love it.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560]   Or so they want us to think.
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.120]   Yeah, who knows what they're on.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.160]   What was the net effect of the Niantic project?
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.080]   We had crossed a threshold.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:04.080]   People's security could be at risk.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.520]   Ingress is not a good one.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.680]   So Niantic Labs has created this.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.720]   Is inside Google, right?
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.040]   Is this a 20% project or is this an actual...
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.960]   What is this?
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   Is this a business?
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   People, but it tracks events.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.600]   I always go out with my sounds.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.680]   It's to monitor the effects of mind hacking.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.640]   Obviously this will be done with the highest of security.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.320]   It's really a neat idea.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.960]   It's a contaminated or threatened.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   It is.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.600]   I found it a little too all-consuming to play, but...
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.160]   It is all-consuming.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   People love it.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   I just got places to go.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.160]   I don't know.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]   I got...
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.160]   I was talking about life.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160]   I just couldn't...
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.960]   It wasn't my thing, but I totally got it.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.600]   And I love that people love it.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.560]   If I lived in a city like you do, I would really be more like a city.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:57.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:06.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:28.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:35.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:58.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:20.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:27.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:35.560]   I would really be more like a city like you do.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.560]   It's a night show.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.560]   A website has done this way for NBC.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560]   It's Headless Drupal.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   They still use Drupal, but Drupal is now an API.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.560]   One of the consumers, but not the only consumer of the API,
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.560]   is a website that's written in Node.js.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.560]   Just as you said, the website is actually just a JavaScript entity
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:01.560]   that is doing calls to the API saying, "Okay, what's the name of the show?
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560]   What's the picture?
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.560]   What's the video?
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.560]   Whatever."
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.560]   I'm not going to go up on the website.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.560]   It's kind of...
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.560]   I approve too.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.560]   It feels modern.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.560]   It feels very modern.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:15.560]   The reason we did this is because we realized that the web is not so important as it used
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:22.560]   to be, that really we see most of the consumers of our content doing it on mobile.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.560]   What we want to do is have an API that can be consumed by a variety of things.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.560]   A website is just one.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.560]   A mobile app would be another.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.560]   We're going to make a public API so that if you'd like to write a little Ruby or Python
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.560]   or something, you'll be able to write a little app if you want because the API is public
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.560]   and freely available.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.560]   You'll be able to query...
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.560]   Right now, there is an API in effect to all podcasts.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   It's the RSS feed, but this is going to go so much more beyond that.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560]   Yeah, that's so limited, right?
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560]   That's great.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.560]   That's awesome, Leo.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   Crazy.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   Yeah, designing an API can be hard.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.560]   But not that's great.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   I'm excited.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.560]   I'm really...
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560]   The four kitchen skies are great.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560]   Gals and guys are great.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.560]   We're doing the Internet.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.560]   There's two phases of development.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.560]   There's the API development, the Drupal development.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.560]   Then there's the UI for the website development.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.560]   We're in the middle of the information architecture, the IA, for the website right now.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.560]   Right, because that's really going to define your API.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560]   You want to design from the outside.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560]   That's a two-way street.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.560]   We also talk to app developers.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.560]   We also talk...
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.560]   What would an API, which would an API have?
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560]   In fact, we consume it internally.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:39.560]   We have a program we use called Elroy that is the generator of the content and the feeds
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560]   and stuff.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:47.560]   So the editor, when he finishes editing the show, he creates a mezzanine file, which is
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:53.560]   a high-quality file, which he then gives Elroy, and he puts all the metadata in Elroy.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.560]   That's going to start moving to Drupal.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.560]   Would he send feeds that to Elroy?
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.560]   And Elroy churns and makes all the different versions, uploads it to YouTube and the CDN.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:07.560]   It posts the feed, creates it to feed and posts it and does all this stuff automatically.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.560]   So Elroy will also be a consumer of the API.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.560]   Very nice.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.560]   That's exciting.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.560]   It seems like the right way to do it.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.560]   Yeah, sounds good to me.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.560]   Those things, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.560]   [laughter]
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:27.560]   You say if we're sold in a year, it's definitely the right way to do it.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.560]   It's modularity.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.560]   You know what it all came from is that the web moves so fast you can no longer.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.560]   You don't want to do a redesign every six months or a year.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.560]   It's too expensive.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.560]   It makes a lot of sense to separate the front end from the back end, right?
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.560]   And have clients and, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.560]   Yeah, it makes sense in my mind.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.560]   Is this a news flash?
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:55.560]   I just got a solid tweet that Firefox is a renewal of Google as default worldwide search came up.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.560]   In the US, it's going to be Yahoo! search.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.560]   Russia, yes.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.560]   Wow.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.560]   That's a huge story.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.560]   Wow.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:09.560]   I'll tell you why that's a huge story because Mozilla, the nonprofit open source foundation that does Firefox,
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560]   makes millions every year from Google.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560]   Google, so it's only 10 zumillions.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:19.560]   And the reason is because that's the default search in that little search window or actually
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.560]   it'll be in the awesome bar.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560]   That's where you go.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:27.560]   And those search results, Google gives a cut of money made from those search results to Mozilla.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   And that's been a lot of, that's been what's kept the foundation going.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   So that's a shocker.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.560]   That is.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   Well Yahoo! must be paying them as much.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   No, I mean for them to leave.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.560]   I guess that's where the cash is going from.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.560]   Maybe more.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.560]   You know, Firefox seems to be moving in the direction of being the privacy browser.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.680]   Just as Apple is distinguishing itself from Android by saying, "Well, we care about your
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.680]   privacy.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.680]   Google doesn't."
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.920]   Firefox lately seems to be doing the same.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.760]   And so that makes sense they might move away from Google.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.560]   Not that Yahoo! is in any way going to protect your privacy.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.920]   I kind of expected DuckDuckGo to announce something with Firefox.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:09.480]   Well, one of the things Firefox did do yesterday in the latest version is make DuckDuckGo an
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.480]   easy choice in their search.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.480]   It's one of the default searches.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.480]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.480]   So wow, yeah, that is a breaking story.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.480]   Big story.
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   The other story I find fascinating if I may is the Google project that auto captions photos.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.360]   Did you see that one on the rundown?
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   How do they know?
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.480]   It's like one of the photos is two dogs running.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.480]   Oh.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   This is the beginning.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.680]   Isn't this the beginning of Skynet really?
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.160]   It's pretty amazing if they can start to interpret images.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.800]   Look at some of those examples.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.520]   Two dogs who are people playing?
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.000]   I was waiting over the puck.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.920]   Well, that you can probably say anybody was a mascot.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.800]   Now, can I get this or is this something internal on it?
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   This is a project right now.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   It's a project.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:09.840]   This is pretty phenomenal that this kind of recognition and translation into searchable,
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:17.160]   analyzable, findable text are heard of elephants walking across a dry grass field.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.520]   Yeah, that's some smarts.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.720]   I mean, so they're turning the knowledge graph inside out, right?
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.760]   They're showing us.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.200]   Hat with a wide brim dog.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.400]   Dog wearing hat with a wide brim would be the--
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400]   Wow.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.720]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.720]   Here's the one.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.600]   The group of people shopping at an outdoor market.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.520]   There are many vegetables at the fruit stand.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.320]   So you're like at a four-year-old level.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.920]   Yeah, but gee, that's impressive.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.920]   Really impressive.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.760]   Yeah, this is-- yeah, this is amazing.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.920]   Yeah, this is a research paper.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:56.920]   But wow.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.960]   I'm going to tap this into Google Glass or something like that.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   It's for accessibility.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:08.960]   I was thinking about the other day.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.360]   I went to the Barnes and Noble and then I went to the men's room.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.320]   I'm sure you're going to let you know that.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:16.960]   And I saw the braille on the door.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.360]   And I'm thinking, how does the blind person find the damn door to do the braille?
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.280]   And I'm thinking, well, there's no reason you couldn't have a map of the store and directions
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.800]   in the store and audio directions to say 20 steps forward due to the right.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.800]   There's the men's room.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.360]   You start to map out the world in these ways.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.640]   Phenomenal things can happen.
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:44.080]   Or, forbin, Colossus the Forbin project.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.600]   It could go either way.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.400]   I like the examples that are completely wrong.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.000]   So there's a photo of a parking sign and it's a refrigerator filled with lots of food and
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   drinks.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   Close enough.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   Close enough.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   What are the dogs catching the frisbee?
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   The yellow school bus parked in a parking lot.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.600]   That's actually not too far off.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.160]   The refrigerator is the worst one here.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   The other one is fabulous.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.160]   I answer.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:18.400]   You could see how it might make that mistake.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.000]   The dog isn't even jumping in that picture.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.880]   For those of you listening on audio, we're just looking at fairly simple pictures and
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.880]   misinterpretations.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:27.640]   But it's still phenomenal.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.640]   It is.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.640]   That's amazing.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.680]   I'm going to download this.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.680]   I can be an actor.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.280]   I can be a computer engineer for my Kindle right now.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280]   Is that the Barb?
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.200]   So Gizmodo published this yesterday and already that's what we were seeing on Milk Shake.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.400]   I couldn't figure out why on Milk Shake I was seeing all these Barbie images.
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.400]   Apparently, there's a book you can buy.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.560]   Barb is on the rundown.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.560]   Is it?
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   I don't know.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560]   You got it.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560]   There's a Gizmodo.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.640]   Barbie, I can be a computer engineer.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.640]   And God bless.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.640]   God bless.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.160]   Let's just take a look at breakfast one morning.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.600]   Barbie is already hard at working on our laptop.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600]   What are you doing?
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.600]   Barbie, S. Skipper.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.040]   I'm designing a game that shows kids how computers work explains Barbie.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.000]   You can make a robot puppy do cute tricks by matching up colored blocks.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   Okay.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.680]   Okay, not so bad.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.400]   Your robot puppy is sweet, says Skipper.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   Can I play your game?
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.080]   Oh, I'm only creating the design ideas.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:25.080]   Barbie says laughing.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:29.120]   I'll need Steven and Brian's help to turn it into a real game.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   God help us.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.760]   Oh, it gets worse.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:37.440]   Barbie tries to email her design to Steven, but suddenly her screen starts leaking.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.000]   This is real.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.080]   Oh, no.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.520]   That's weird, says Barbie.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.840]   Barbie and Skipper try to reboot the computer, but nothing happens.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.840]   Looks like you've got a virus, big sister, says Skipper.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.200]   Luckily, I wear my flash drive on a necklace, so I'll always remember to back up my work
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:58.720]   replies, Barbie.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.840]   When Barbie puts her flash drive into Skipper's laptop, the screen starts blinking.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.000]   Oh, no, says Barbie.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.160]   The virus must be on the flash drive.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.920]   I forgot to back up my homework assignment, Christ Skipper, and all my music files are
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.320]   lost too.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.520]   Fortunately, and by the way, then she hit playfully hits Barbie with a pillow, because that's
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.520]   always fun when girls have pillow fights.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:23.920]   Barbie makes it to computer classes before the bell rings.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.320]   As soon as the class begins, Barbie raises her hand.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:31.120]   Yes, Barbie asks Ms. Smith, the teacher, "If your computer gets a virus and crashes, how
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.240]   can you retrieve all the files you lost?"
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.240]   Ask Barbie.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:40.040]   And then Ms. Smith gives it a fairly good answer.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   Not so bad.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.520]   Remove the hard drive.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.840]   But let's go talk to Steven and Brian, the geeks.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.920]   "Hi, guys," says Barbie.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.200]   "I tried to send my designs, but I ended up crashing my laptop, and Skippers too.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.920]   I need to get back to lost files and repair both of our laptops."
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:59.320]   "It'll go faster if Brian and I help offer Steven.
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.600]   By the way, you want to take a ride, my Uber?"
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.320]   "Great," says Barbie.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.840]   "Steven, can you hook up Skipper's hard drive to the library computer?"
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.480]   "Sure," says Steven.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:14.120]   The library computer has excellent security software to protect it.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.520]   Anyway, so that's the meme now, is to take these...
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:24.920]   "If you go to the rundown, on the last thing under other, it's make your own Barbie computer."
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.920]   So, me and Pat get off.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.800]   Thank God for Brian and Skipper.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.920]   That's all I can say because Barbie...
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   "Brian and Steven."
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.920]   "Brian and Steven."
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.920]   "Brian and Steven."
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:35.920]   "Brian and Steven."
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:36.920]   "I actually...
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:37.920]   I didn't read that story.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.320]   I avoided it because I'm so worried that Barbie is inevitably in my future.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.840]   Like that, we're gonna have to reckon with Barbie and somehow."
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.280]   "To be fair, as bad as this is, it could be worse.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280]   I mean, they are...
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.080]   It would have been...
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.920]   I mean, Ms. Smith is...
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.720]   The female teacher is smart and knows a little bit about computers.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.080]   At computer class, Barbie presents the game she designed.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.440]   Ms. Smith is so impressed that she gives Barbie extra credit.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.400]   Barbie's terrific computer skills have saved the day for both sisters.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.280]   I guess I can be a computer engineer, says Barbie happily.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.920]   So, she discovered it doesn't mean it.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.320]   It's about what you'd expect.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.120]   The only thing that's really bad is when she says, "Huh, I'm not designing the game.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:23.400]   I'm just drawing the designs.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.240]   I need Steven and Brian's help to turn it into a real game.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.120]   That's where maybe you could have left that line out."
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.680]   "I mean, what was there?
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.920]   Thank God I'm looking for you."
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.800]   "It could be worse, listen.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.400]   I'm never going to look to Barbie for a progressive take on this."
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:43.160]   "You only get where you're going to be, Gina, where I used to go is American Girl."
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.040]   "That is another aspect of..."
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.000]   "Oh, I loved American Girl.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   That was not too bad."
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   "It was not too bad.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.040]   Those were the stories that were actually very good."
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.560]   "No, American Girl was fine.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:58.160]   And Abby and I went to Chicago to the American Girl's doll museum and we had TV.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.640]   They have a little chair at the table for your doll and her tea."
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.960]   "The stories are, I think, pretty...
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.760]   Now I have to link them back.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.760]   Pretty empowering.
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:14.920]   They're all about young women in history, in so much of historic periods.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.480]   I think they're all powerful and good, right?"
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.320]   "Pretty much, yeah.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.960]   They're okay, Gina.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.960]   Really, the stories are okay."
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.280]   "Here's an example of the Internet's response to Barbie.
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.840]   So Barbie's sitting at the computer skipper's pouring.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.600]   Instead of saying, "Oh, no, I'm just designing and I'm going to ask the boys to do the work."
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:37.240]   "The story says, 'Poor mine with an extra espresso shot' says some scrub decide to
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.400]   link directly to Atlas instead of generic blast and lop pack.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:44.960]   So now I have to write patches to get this BS to link against Accelerate. framework instead.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:50.440]   I am not about to pollute/user/local/lib with a bunch of stupid dependencies.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.240]   This awful shared library model is why Linux can't have nice things."
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   "The Linux can have nice things."
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.240]   "That's my Barbie."
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.240]   "Awesome.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.240]   That is awesome."
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.240]   "That's my Barbie."
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.240]   "That's what I'm going to do with that.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.840]   In these situations, we're going to rewrite the story."
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.120]   "Let's take the panels and hack it."
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.360]   "You just get to do that because she can't read yet.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.080]   So you just read it to her this way."
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.520]   "Oh, you have no idea.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.520]   I changed the words.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.960]   My wife laughs and laughs.
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.520]   Every line about the girl-a-girl loving hot pink, I'm like, "Oh, I really hate.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520]   I changed the words.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520]   I say mama and mommy.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.720]   I mean, I just, yeah."
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.080]   "I love the riff on kids' books."
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.800]   "So if you all of a sudden see a lot of Barbie and computers in your meme feed, that's
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.800]   where that's coming from."
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]   "That's where that's coming from."
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.800]   "The response has been pretty darn excellent."
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.240]   "I'm going to have her publish her own books.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.240]   That's what I'm going to do."
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:38.240]   "There you go.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.120]   Give her a copy of "Vellum Letter Have at It."
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.120]   "Get nuts."
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.000]   "The oral history of the poop emoji by Fast Company."
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   "I have to."
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   "Nice reading.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.160]   Did you put this in here?"
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.960]   "No, I did not.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.960]   I wouldn't do that."
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.960]   "Sorry about that, Leo."
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:57.600]   "This is important journalism."
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.600]   "Yeah.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.120]   I did not." "It set the word Google and I was like, 'Okay.'"
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.520]   "There's a Google story."
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.520]   "Yeah, there we go."
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   "The Poomo-gee."
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.520]   "Poomo-gee."
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.520]   "It's good for a couple."
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:14.200]   "Actually, it's a history of emojis and et cetera, et cetera."
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.040]   "If you go up three, the compilation of videos about the internet from the 80s and 90s."
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.040]   "Oh, yeah.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.040]   We've played some of those on our show."
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.040]   "Okay, great.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.040]   That's a good one."
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.040]   "They're hysterical."
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:27.800]   "And on fact, I'm guilty of, I'm guilty for some of these because I, of course, did a
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:34.200]   PBS show called the Internet Exploration Mark, which I try to explain."
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.920]   "The other good video is the, I don't know if this is complete."
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.040]   "These are all from Andy Bio.
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.520]   This is Andy Bio's channel on the-"
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.520]   "Andy Bio's, yes.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.480]   It's a great, great list."
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:47.560]   "I want to see Steve Allen and Jane Meadows' computer video from 1984."
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.160]   "What the what?
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.360]   This is the VHS era internet."
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:55.600]   "What you love to graphics?"
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.600]   "Putability.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.600]   Starring.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.600]   Steve Allen, which most of our heads never heard of, and Jane Meadows."
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   "Index."
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.600]   "This is the home cassette that has been indexed with a color code for your convenience."
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:08.600]   "The introduction."
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.600]   "I got a gem head a moment."
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.600]   "Let's just see.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.600]   Let's just see some hacker."
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.600]   "Who's the computer and music has to eat stinks and sleeps computers?"
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.600]   "Now, a hacker would definitely own a modem."
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:24.240]   "This is a device that changes the electronic impulses in the computer into sounds that
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.800]   can be carried over a telephone line.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.400]   Very useful for communicating with other computers, data banks, information services,
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.400]   etc.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.400]   As you'll see, tape drives.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.000]   Tape drives a lot more than the disk type because they store the data sequentially."
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.800]   "I love her faux British accents."
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.400]   "I love her other terms, most of which you'll never need."
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.920]   "You'll pick up a lot of them the more you work with your computer."
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.360]   Kids' actresses in the 30s and 40s often affected British accents even though they were from
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.360]   the Bronx.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.360]   "Because learning a lot of new words can be used to be used to the first time."
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.360]   "And what's with the hair?"
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.640]   "I guarantee in a few weeks you'll be using these terms as easily as counting from one
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:03.640]   to ten."
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.000]   "I have no idea what any of them need, but I'm reading the teleprompter well."
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.040]   "But you know what I have to say, I love Steve Allen and J. Meadows, so I'm going to
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.040]   watch this."
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.200]   "Look at his hair.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.960]   I think his hair is higher than hers."
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.200]   "This is just what he's like at home."
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   "That was the movie J.Lo."
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.520]   "The multitude of things, a computer of reason."
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.360]   "Steve Allen invented the Tonight Show practically.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.840]   Many of the jokes that you see people like Letterman and Eve and Fallon do now were started
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:31.840]   by Steve Allen.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.240]   Alright, let's do a commercial work.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.520]   Unless you see one more story if you find something you want, the poop emoji grabbed
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:37.520]   me.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.520]   "I thought it might."
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.520]   "I thought it might."
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.520]   "Yeah."
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:41.520]   "This is good news.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.760]   We talked about this insecurity now.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:49.360]   What's app is going to add end-to-end encryption from the open source text secure messaging system."
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.760]   That's from Open Whisper Systems.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:54.720]   That is a really strong encryption, strong solution.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.200]   Of course, as soon as it's within WhatsApp, maybe you don't know exactly how they implement
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.680]   it, but I think this is really great news.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.040]   It shows that Facebook, I think Facebook's kind of thinking along with these other big
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.240]   companies, Google and Apple and Microsoft, how can we get out from under the NSA?
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.480]   "Let's not forget that the bill to restrict the NSA was defeated yesterday."
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:21.360]   What it was is it's one of those weird votes.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.160]   They needed a super majority because it was a vote to debate.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.160]   They needed 60 votes.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160]   They only got 50.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160]   "Your government works."
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.160]   Or not.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.600]   That's the case maybe.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.000]   Alright, let's wrap this up.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.640]   I think we got all the big stories in here.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:43.120]   We're going to get your tip and number and tool of the week in just a minute, but first
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.120]   a word from Squarespace.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   That's my tip of the week.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   Get your website.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:52.200]   "Hytheovertosquarespace.com," the best website hosting and content management system.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:56.120]   We're talking about Google and the search results letting you know whether a site is
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.560]   mobile friendly.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:02.200]   All Squarespace sites are automatically mobile friendly because their templates are all
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.400]   mobile responsive.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.840]   That means the design looks great no matter what size screen.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.960]   You don't even have to think about it.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.080]   Start with 25, actually more.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.600]   They keep adding new templates.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.800]   Beautiful templates.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:19.320]   Many of them design for specific categories like musicians or artists or architects or
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.880]   chefs.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.960]   That gives you a great starting point.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:27.960]   The band template Horizon for instance has a tour dates page, a music player and a merchandise
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:28.960]   store.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:34.320]   In fact, all the Squarespace templates are e-commerce enabled, which is nice.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.200]   Even if you just want to do a wedding register, all cash-reading registry or donations for
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.240]   a school library.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.120]   Squarespace 7 is new and it really adds some nice features including the ability to live
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.560]   edit on a single screen so you don't have to go back and forth between preview and site
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.560]   manager.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.880]   You can even preview designs in device mode so you'll see how your design will look on
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.640]   a tablet or mobile device.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.600]   You get instant access to professional stock photography from Getty.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.160]   Instant branded email set up with Google Apps.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.600]   New developer platform is so sweet.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:11.400]   If you are a guru of web design, if you're a JavaScript or CSS or HTML user, you'll love
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.680]   the dev platform with color-coded syntax and all.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:21.760]   Easy to use, but if you need help, 24/7 support from their offices, live chat and email 24/7
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.040]   plus self-help articles, video workshops and their newly redesigned help portal, it's
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.040]   really great.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:32.240]   And all this $8 a month, that includes a free domain name when you sign up for a year,
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.840]   but better than that, if you just visit squarespace.com and click the Get Started button, you can
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.720]   just set up a site right now.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.680]   Play with all the tools, even import your existing content.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.240]   And you'll see how easy it is to change the template without changing the content.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:51.720]   It's just, it's exactly modern state of the art, web design and hosting.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.720]   You're going to love it.
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.720]   Start that free two week trial.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.680]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.000]   If you decide to buy, all I ask is use our offer code Twig TWIG and that way you get 10%
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   off.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.600]   And you tell them you heard it on this week in Google.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.360]   If you are an existing Squarespace 7 customer, by the way, I'm sorry, if you're a Squarespace
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:12.560]   6 customer, you can turn on 7.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:18.920]   If you go to the Settings tab and click Activate, that way you get all the new features Squarespace.com,
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:22.280]   click the Get Started button, use the offer code Twig to save 10%.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.880]   We thank them so much.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.720]   They have been long-term supporters of this show and all of our network.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.680]   And we're happy to say we'll be back with us as almost all of our sponsors will in 2015.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.800]   We're starting to sign up people for next year.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.800]   Lots of interests.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.200]   Glad to say.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.560]   Let us get your tip of the week, Gina Trepani.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:49.280]   So I must get asked a couple of times a week it feels like for advice from listeners from
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.000]   the shows or just online in general, you know, I want to learn how to program where should
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.320]   I start, what languages should I use, you know, where do I start?
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:02.200]   And that's a really hard thing to, a hard question to answer, especially in a tweet.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:06.080]   I suspect that a lot of young people, especially young people, but lots of people want a job
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.040]   at Google.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:14.760]   And Google has actually, Google for Education anyway, has published a list of a guide for
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:20.440]   technical development, a suggested list of courses and subjects for people for aspiring
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.160]   software engineers to teach themselves.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:30.600]   This doesn't, of course, guarantee a job at Google, but these are really good recommendations.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.240]   Like recommendations and non-academic recommendations.
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.920]   So if you're a student in school and you want to teach yourself or not, some really
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:44.040]   good stuff here, there are all links to third party courses, some of Coursera, some from
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:49.920]   the various universities on, you know, what Google thinks is worth, is worth learning.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.000]   So you got your introduction to computer science course, programming at least one object-oriented
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.200]   programming language.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.000]   This is pretty, this is skewed very Google.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.880]   So Google uses Java and Python primarily.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:03.520]   So they, of course, recommend learning C++ Java or Python.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.040]   Then of course, all the languages, the web, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:11.600]   But some really, really great stuff here on debugging and testing and artificial intelligence
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.840]   and building compilers and cryptography.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.840]   Awesome resource here.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:21.040]   So if you're really interested in learning and becoming a programmer or becoming a software
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.760]   engineer or starting a new career in that, I think this is actually a really good place
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.560]   to start.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.160]   It's Google's guide for technical development.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:33.360]   I'm sure that if you Google that, it'll be the first thing that comes up.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   That's nice.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.480]   Yeah, yeah, I thought it was a helpful way.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.760]   I mean, there's so many resources out there to teach yourself, you know, some sponsors
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.680]   of these shows and Code Academy and lots of different things.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.800]   It's hard to know where to start.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:49.800]   And I feel like this is a good starting point.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.680]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.800]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.200]   Well, I think I'll take this one.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:03.220]   Flurry, who is not an analysis, to show that time spent on mobile devices now exceeds time
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.220]   spent on television.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.220]   Wow.
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:06.720]   Google is the first screen.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.720]   That's a pretty big deal.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   Wow.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.920]   So how much in am I hours a day?
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:17.880]   Two hours and 57 minutes a day versus two hours and 48 minutes daily on TV according
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:24.480]   to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics or our paper statistics, I guess, in this case.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:29.360]   The Bureau of Labor Statistics does measures time on TV and mobile.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   Interesting.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.000]   So many people unemployed these days, it's really important to know.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000]   I love this.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.600]   So if you click on the link to the BLS watching TV two point hours a day, relaxing and thinking
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:43.840]   18 minutes a day.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.840]   Oh, there you go.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:45.840]   That's the problem.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:49.880]   You're probably only thick along with relaxed 18 minutes a day.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:50.880]   There's the problem.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.080]   How do you even measure that?
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.080]   Who knows?
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:57.720]   How much time do I spend thinking?
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:58.920]   I think they don't mean thinking.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.400]   I think they mean on the can.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:07.600]   But that's just a thought.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.400]   Reading 19 minutes a day.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:10.400]   Oh.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.400]   Your computer, you're reading.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.400]   Right.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.560]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:18.080]   Reading paper is separate than reading on the screen.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.080]   Apparently.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.800]   You know, it's not real reading, Gina.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.920]   That's an interesting point, though.
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.520]   We probably now read more than ever before, thanks to you.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:27.520]   Oh, yeah, I think so.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.520]   No doubt.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.520]   No doubt.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.040]   I read a lot of articles, a lot of stuff online.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.360]   I read probably a magazine's worth every day.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.720]   I'd opt to read a user interface from an app before talk to an actual human any day.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:42.800]   Come to the think of it.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.400]   Well, here's one more app that'll keep you on your phone.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.880]   We were talking about Uniqlo.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:52.640]   Tony Wang messaged me and said, "My favorite Uniqlo product is their Wake Me app."
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.040]   Let me show you the website.
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.040]   You're kidding me.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.040]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.680]   It's Uniqlo Wake Up.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.720]   I think the app is Uniqlo.com/wakeup.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.960]   And it wakes you up with music appropriate to the day's weather.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:10.520]   On Friday, today is a...
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.320]   This is very Japanese.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.760]   Super Japanese in a good way.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.560]   All right, I'm not going to set this up.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.520]   I'm not going to put out the window.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.000]   Good morning, Jeff.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.680]   Today is a Uniqlo day.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:25.680]   They have other apps, by the way.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:28.480]   You can design a Uniqlo t-shirt on your phone and whatever.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.320]   This is for iOS and Android.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.160]   Uniqlo Wake Up, it's called.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.080]   Let me set it up because I just downloaded it for the...
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.240]   Oh, network error.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.200]   I'm having trouble with this phone.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.560]   It seems this is a Galaxy Note 4 and it seems to be confused about the network.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.560]   The Wi-Fi.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.560]   Wow.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.840]   I see a network here.
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.720]   I don't understand.
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.720]   Maybe it's...
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.720]   Maybe I'll turn off the...
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:49.720]   Go to the mobile network.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.960]   Maybe that'll make it work better.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.920]   Uniqlo Wake Up.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:55.320]   Hello.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.360]   Wake Up with music that changes with the weather.
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.440]   Share the start of your day.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.880]   Should I have it in English, Mandarin or none?
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.000]   I'm going to have English, Fahrenheit.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.040]   I don't think I'll share this with Ren Ren or Wibo.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.040]   Maybe Facebook or Twitter.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.600]   Let me tell it's a Chinese app.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.840]   And now I guess it's going to get the weather forecast.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.240]   How interesting.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.560]   The page brings you the latest Uniqlo Wake Up news.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:22.560]   Apparently there is none.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.000]   It's got a little clock.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.520]   I could set the alarm.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.440]   I should set an alarm.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.200]   Oh, I have to do this up here.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.000]   She's setting an alarm for now.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.640]   There you go.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.360]   World time.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:43.360]   It's starting to wake me up.
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.360]   Oh, no.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.360]   Let's go back.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.360]   I want to wake up.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.360]   Wake me up again.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360]   Let's add another alarm.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.360]   Let's make this 514.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   That was kind of pretty music though.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.360]   Tony says he loves this.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360]   It's free.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.360]   I like it.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:07.680]   My QLO Uniqlo Wake Up Wake Up with music that changes the weather.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:09.400]   And then I guess you can share the stars.
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:11.800]   See, she's sleeping with her phone.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.080]   And she's looking out the window.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.480]   So maybe she's going to share.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.480]   On Friday.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.720]   Today is a sunny day.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:22.400]   Oh, Lord.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.360]   This was on the Android Apparina.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:25.840]   Oh.
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.360]   This was a Ron's pick, I believe.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:29.360]   Wilding.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.360]   I hope you're watching.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.360]   I hope you're watching.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.200]   We had a good bit about it actually if I remember correctly.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.360]   How could you not?
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.360]   Sunday day.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.360]   Oh.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360]   Hello.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:44.360]   It's 314 PM on Wednesday.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.360]   Today is a cloudy day.
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.360]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.360]   I would.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360]   Oh.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   It's going to keep going.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.360]   It's going to be 414 PM on Wednesday.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.360]   Today is a cloudy day.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.360]   Makes you want to just use the poop emoji, doesn't it?
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.360]   All right.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.360]   All right.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.360]   There you go.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.360]   Tony Wang's tool of--
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.360]   Thanks so much, Tony.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.360]   It's time for me.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:19.360]   Tony, are you wearing a uni-close shirt?
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.360]   Yeah, I bet he is.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.360]   I bet he is.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:25.320]   Hey, Jeff, did you-- did anything come while we were doing the show?
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:26.320]   Did you check the app?
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.320]   Nope.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.320]   Nope.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:34.320]   I checked the doors for an earlier commercial break, but there's nothing.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.320]   All right.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.320]   Okay.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.320]   We're both waiting for our Nexus 6.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:41.320]   It's a race.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.320]   Gina Tripani, is it ThinkUp?
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.320]   Don't forget, you can take advantage of a special bundle right now if you want to get ThinkUp
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.320]   along with some other great stuff.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.320]   What's the URL for that again?
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:53.320]   Goodwebbundle.com.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:54.320]   It's a good gift.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.320]   It's a good webbundle.
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.320]   Good webbundle.com.
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:57.320]   Thanks, Liam.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320]   Cool.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.320]   Have fun today.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.840]   I'm actually not on that site.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.320]   I am using, though, that really great Google extension that shows beautiful land masses
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.320]   on my new tab.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.320]   I know I love it.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:10.320]   I know.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.320]   I kept it on mine, too.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.320]   I love it.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.320]   I just absolutely love it.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.320]   And by the way, it changes all the time.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:16.320]   There's always fresh stuff.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.320]   But it also-- it does recycle some.
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:20.320]   Some.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.320]   You see some repeats.
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.760]   I think that that might be within a short period of time because I haven't seen any of these
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.760]   before.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.520]   I've seen some of them come place before, but it still is magnificent.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.520]   It's really beautiful.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:32.000]   My problem is I'll open it up to have it go do something and then I'll want to go-- I
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.800]   want to hit the back button to see what I just--
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.800]   Great.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.800]   Let me get that down again.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.800]   I get distracted.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.800]   Like, oh, what was I doing?
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.800]   Where is that place?
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.800]   You know, like--
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.800]   We live in a beautiful planet, don't we?
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.800]   We do.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.000]   It's a beautiful world.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000]   Just a gorgeous world.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.680]   I wonder how they select these images.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.360]   They probably have an algorithm.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:55.120]   I'm sure that there's some bot who's like, this is visually interesting.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.560]   This is visually interesting.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:01.240]   Let us see if we should-- I bet you-- the number of-- there's an algorithm at the number
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.920]   of colors, the shapes.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.920]   There is.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:04.920]   There is.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.720]   This is pleasing to the human eye.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.560]   Here's a cog jumping from a ball.
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:11.440]   My humans would enjoy this refrigerator full of food.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.640]   Yes, my human overlords would get distracted by this photo.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:16.640]   Let's just--
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.640]   Just calm them down as I take over their lives.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.800]   The other time, Skyd has come in.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.520]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.520]   He's the best.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.640]   His new book is out, geeks, bearing, gifts, managing, new--
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:33.360]   Future for news.
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.360]   --for news.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.840]   And you can find that on Amazon.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:36.840]   It's pretty damn walkie-pokes.
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:37.840]   That's walkie-pokes.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.840]   No, no, no.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:41.040]   This is exactly the question I was talking about earlier.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.040]   There it is.
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.600]   We need to solve this problem so that we can know what's true.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.240]   I despair of that, but we'll see.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.000]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.280]   It is every Wednesday at 1 p.m. that we do this show.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.280]   That's a specific time, a specific standard time.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:04.040]   We do it at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and 2100 UTC live on twit.tv.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:09.000]   After the fact, you can get audio and video of the show from twit.tv/twig or from our
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.360]   YouTube.com/thisweekongooble or from whatever podcast app you like.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:20.200]   There are a lot of them, including Stitcher and Instacast and Slacker and a app named
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:22.520]   Podcast on your phone.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:25.240]   I use a dog catcher on Android like that a lot.
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.440]   I still use them that way.
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.440]   Yeah, it's really good.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.440]   Pocketcast is good.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.440]   What do you use?
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   Pocketcast.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:31.440]   Pocketcast.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.440]   Pocketcast.
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.440]   You switch too, huh?
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.440]   Maybe I ought to switch.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.440]   I don't know.
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.920]   Just anything that downloads a show that I can listen to or are slightly--
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:38.920]   Yeah, totally.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:39.920]   They all do that.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.920]   So--
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:42.920]   --here's a Twitter app.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:43.920]   I recommend that.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:44.920]   I think a podcast does the syncing across devices.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:45.920]   Oh, that's a nice thing.
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.840]   You know, it's interesting because that's one of the things we're talking about in the
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:56.040]   API is the ability to save user state so that we know where you stop watching or listening
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:59.720]   to a show so that when you use something else, it'll say, "Would you like to start where
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.720]   you left off?"
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.720]   Ooh.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720]   Non-trivial.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:05.080]   Non-trivial at all.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:08.800]   That's some advanced stuff there, Leo.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.920]   Good for you, but watch out for scope creep.
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.920]   Well, you know what?
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:14.960]   Someday we'll talk about this.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.600]   Four kitchens is very agile.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:19.160]   I mean, like dogmatically agile.
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.160]   Yep.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.880]   And so we use scrums.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:26.080]   We use that whole points technique to assign points.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.280]   We have a backlog.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.640]   We groom the backlog.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.360]   I'm learning all these weird, scrummy--
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.160]   Burned, burned down charts.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:35.360]   Yeah, all of that stuff.
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360]   So we're boards.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:39.360]   User stories.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.660]   We came up with hundreds of user stories.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:41.660]   You know what?
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.680]   It would be very interesting, special to do sometimes.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:46.200]   So have you used this methodology?
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.200]   I have.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:50.480]   I'm not a zealot and I haven't used the more advanced stuff.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:56.640]   But I'm a big fan of burned down charts just as a way to assess how much work and estimating
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.480]   and breaking down tasks and changing the burn and stand up.
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:06.120]   So I find these methodologies super, super interesting.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:09.120]   And I learn-- I'm kind of a cafeteria Catholic.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.380]   I'm a cafeteria agile.
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:12.380]   I take--
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:13.380]   Well, we are working with the Pope.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:14.380]   Let me tell you, Avadual.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:16.120]   I'm a
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:17.120]   Holy cow.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:21.940]   I'm personally always a little wary of the kind of the folks that are like one true way.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:23.700]   I must do it exactly.
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:25.220]   But I think it does work.
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:29.540]   I mean, if you have a development shop that's just committed to the methodology and that's
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.660]   a language they speak and it works for everyone, that's great.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:35.100]   I've never been on a team where everyone was fully on board and fully committed.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.100]   So it's always been kind of piecemeal for me.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.900]   Yeah, no, this is pretty serious.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:40.780]   We have a certified scrum master.
[01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.780]   Paul Benjamin is running this thing like a clockwork.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:45.700]   Oh, you've got a scrum master.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   A scrum master.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.300]   We have stand ups every day.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:49.300]   Nice.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:52.200]   Yeah, we get spanked if we don't show up.
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.140]   It's really good so far.
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:55.800]   It is process heavy at the beginning.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:59.340]   And so there's some debate over how much time we spend a lot of money on process right
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:00.340]   now.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:05.100]   But I think that this is what you have to do to make sure that we as the project owners
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.300]   get our needs heard.
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.300]   Yes.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:11.980]   And the developers understand the job that they need to do.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:14.060]   That's the hardest thing I think in software development.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:18.140]   Yeah, there's a lot of value I think to formalizing that, especially if you're working with a third
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.740]   party at, I think that's great.
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.700]   I would love to see that special.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:22.700]   Okay.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:25.420]   When the four kitchens people come here, maybe we'll do it.
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:26.420]   The making of.
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:27.420]   The making of.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:29.460]   It's driving certain of us crazy.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:33.900]   Wait, I want to hear more about that.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.300]   That'll have to be an offline conversation.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.300]   Okay.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.740]   I understand how much geeks love process.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:44.580]   And sometimes to the point where we love process rather than doing anything.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:48.420]   So, you know, you use the getting things done methodology.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:53.060]   Many a geek has done 43 folders and set it all up just so, but never gets anything done.
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.700]   But man, they have a system.
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:59.340]   And so I always want to temper the love of the system with an actual desire to get work
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.340]   done.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:01.340]   But I think it's getting done.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:06.140]   And if I tell you what, we'll know at the end, if you like the new Twitch site, then it
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:07.140]   will have worked.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:08.140]   Absolutely.
