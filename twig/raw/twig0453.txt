[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.960]   This week at Google is brought to you by WordPress reach more customers when you build your business website on WordPress
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.860]   .com plan start at just four dollars a month and get 15% off any new plan at WordPress .com/twig
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.840]   It's time for Twig this week in Google the show we talk about the latest news from the Google verse the Facebook verse the Twitter verse and the universe
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.440]   Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey and IOT she has an exciting day today
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.080]   We'll talk about why
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.840]   Very exciting and I'm not talking about the wine dinner. You're going to later today
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.280]   I'm talking about Microsoft's big announcement. We'll also welcome Jeff Jarvis from the City University, New York
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.120]   He's back in his office. He is a professor of journalism there. He's also at buzz machine.com the author of many a fine tome
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.640]   He's a Tomologist
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   Which is better or worse than being a tamale
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.720]   or a tomography
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.080]   So this kind of surprised me on Windows weekly and they said you were tweeting all about it. You're very excited about this
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.920]   Microsoft announced a secure IOT hardware software play called a
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.600]   Azure sphere
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.040]   Yes, it is a three-way play. So there is a MCU microcontroller
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.960]   There is a OS secure OS that sits on top of the microcontroller
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.920]   Most people were very excited because this is a Linux based distribution
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.240]   And then there is a cloud element
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.800]   which is the what do they call it the secure cloud or something and what all this is is
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.680]   This is designed to solve a lot of the problems with connected devices and these are not
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   computers servers things that have like
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.440]   official big chips big chips and then there there are things like washing machines microwaves
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.800]   Not actually wearables because there's an a7 in there, but they have microcontroller so these tiny
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   Smaller chips that don't have a lot of processing power except this one does so it's it's a little different
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.560]   It's certificate based authentication and it's got a secure element on the chip. So
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.680]   What's happening here is you're like you put this in your device?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.480]   It's going to have its own it's going to be basically auditable secure and you can actually update it from over the air send
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.840]   Everything via encrypted traffic and it's it's actually a really
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.760]   Pretty awesome step forward for IoT security the big catches are here they come
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.240]   These are still pretty significant chips. There's an there a microcontroller is usually very small
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.920]   But they have an arm a7 chip on there. So that's that's actually a big chip
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.240]   So this is not for like sensors. This is going to be in devices that have substantial enough batteries
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.440]   It's not like bolts. It's doorbells. It's cameras. It's light bulbs would work
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.620]   Really small
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.960]   Well, yeah, it's small enough for that and you can plug a light bulb in I mean it's oh, that's right
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.780]   So you're thinking I see low power devices and battery power
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.000]   I'm thinking I'm like looking around for the sensors that are scattered in my desktop
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But like a door window sensor
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.520]   And the other thing is this doesn't do anything for all of the devices that are out there now
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   So this is coming in the future end of year
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.320]   You should start seeing devices that have this on there and then the third thing is for this to actually work
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.800]   Microsoft has to partner with the chip guys and the chip guys have to put Microsoft's IP on their silicon and
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Adopt it mean it's gonna be a little bit in the initial batch of chips. Although Qualcomm has said they're interested
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.940]   Yes, yes, Qualcomm's interested. I think I
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.560]   Bet Samsung is not because they've got their own platform. They have a secure chip for their Arctic
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.160]   Platform so they have Arctic modules and they have an Arctic s module which is their secure module
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760]   So it'll be interesting to see what happens there arm is a partner for this
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.600]   So if you license arm stuff, you can just wiggle the Microsoft IP block in there
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.040]   Like licensing will be inexpensive
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   But I think they make their money because it uses the Azure cloud
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.640]   Well, so this is where it gets fun
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.680]   they
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.000]   You this does use the Azure cloud you pay a one-time fee for the chip and the license and it's a 10-year life
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.800]   And what will happen is you can use Azure cloud
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.680]   So you can send the data from the secure device anywhere you want so
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.160]   You don't have to use Azure
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.000]   Where I think this gets maybe more interesting is Microsoft has an edge product Microsoft IoT edge
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.400]   I believe it's called and this is for like intermittent computing environments like
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.840]   Think about like a container ship or anything where the power and connectivity might come off for off and on
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.120]   You're gonna need a platform for that that can handle those on and off environments
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.200]   It's gonna be easier to tie it to Microsoft's IoT edge than it might be for
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.000]   You to tie it to AWS green grass for example, so that's where things are gonna start
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It'll still work with AWS green grass, but you might have to work a little bit harder
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.600]   It's my guess that it really the goal here is to compete with Amazon and Google
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.920]   And to provide something that really is security first, which is something Amazon and Google really aren't
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.960]   No, Amazon has a chance with free art us, but they haven't done anything there
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.600]   Yeah, so and I think this is this actually is really good news for consumers
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.120]   It's it's Microsoft saying we're gonna this is an important thing for us
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:39.080]   IoT and we're gonna make a secure platform and that means you'd be able to look and I'm sure they'll have some badge or some sort of
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:47.480]   Certification and that'll be on the box and you'll have this sense that yeah, not only is this a secure system is Microsoft gonna provide patches to the
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.640]   Operating system as needed. Oh, yes, that's part of the secure it
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.080]   So yes over the ten year life of the chip and that's really actually a hugely important thing for IoT is
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.480]   Having such a long lived support element although as a consumer
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.880]   I'm like yay ten years. That sounds reasonable, but then I'm like I have had washing machines
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:18.320]   But it's better than anything out there right now and I even you know where this really becomes valuable is these Chinese companies that are making these really
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.800]   insecure cameras and and other IoT devices
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.600]   routers they can for a reasonable fee put this Microsoft thing in there and
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.280]   Saves them a lot of development time and consumers in the States will look at it say okay
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:39.680]   I could trust this even though I never heard of Xiaomi or whoever right this $20 device that compares to all the $100 device as well
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.400]   It's got ashers fear than it. Yeah, that's true. It's gonna cost a license that
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:50.120]   That is not disclosed, but I did talk to someone in the community and they were like it's a bit pricey
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.920]   But really it's not gonna be a $20 hammer anymore. It'll be a well
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.160]   I've done no, I don't think well pricey for this segment is a few dollars
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.840]   Well, it's a few cents. I mean so when you're looking at your chip pricing
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   It's a few cents, but if it's like an extra buck then that has that's a 20 bucks on your right and
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.440]   Anyway, I don't know if that was way like super nerdy for y'all so I think I think that
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.240]   Microsoft was saying it was not expensive, but of course that's all in the eye, but yeah expensive is in the eye of the beholder
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.560]   But what I think this is really good news and it for a few reasons
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.600]   It makes it easier for companies to make secure it IOT devices without doing all that back in R&D
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.120]   It and it makes competition for Amazon and Google
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.720]   an Apple to some degree and
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.280]   It encourages them to put security first all of which is really good for the general ecosystem
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.480]   I think this is I'm really happy to see Microsoft do this and it's kind of a surprise. It's a little bit out of nowhere
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.520]   They've been working on it for four years. Yeah, that's what they called soap risk that they were working on and we were talking
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.400]   This is it this is the rules for project soap risk. So Galen who did that and it's all based on their
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.320]   Oh, what's their gaming console Xbox? Sorry
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.200]   By the way, I talked that he's already
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.560]   I'm the can it's in the can it's in the can and so the next
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.040]   The next I
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.160]   IOT will be the interview with Galen. What's his name? Galen Hunt who is the guy?
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.400]   Who is the guy who came up with his seven security principles that he was designing for and then right?
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.720]   If you thought the stuff I just said was interesting. I talk about it even more with him. Yeah
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.560]   Microsoft's presidents Brad Smith said he expects nine billion
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.320]   IOT devices to ship this year
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.280]   I'm with Brad nine billion with a B
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.320]   So this is this is probably the fastest growing technology segment ever and
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.120]   As it stands right now is a massive threat to security. So this is a big deal and
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.800]   I feel like Microsoft
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.720]   Really put a stake in the sand it goes right up against Google and Amazon because those the those are the other two big companies
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.320]   And as I said Apple wants to be in this but they but they haven't made anything particularly compelling yet
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.300]   Although Apple will be security and privacy first, right?
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.200]   Yes, but I think this might actually go up more against Samsung and Apple
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.400]   Oh, yes a bit Amazon. So really what they're trying to do is
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:37.680]   And even the chip players none of the chip players have gotten their act together on this the closest thing we had because this market's so fragmented
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.000]   so I think this is really
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.160]   Yes, it should drive Amazon and Google to be more secure
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.200]   But I would say Samsung actually makes these modules Apple already does its own chips. They have the MFI program
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:58.400]   Yeah, Samsung I'd forgotten completely, but they were there acquisition of smart things and all the devices they make if they're a big player in this
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.320]   Yeah, they just integrated all their all their appliances and smart things
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.000]   They're in the process like right as we talk of integrating that all in together
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.240]   So if you have Samsung appliances
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.720]   You can start doing some really cool stuff like your lights will flick on when your dryer is done
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.960]   Okay, maybe that's not really cool. I think it's cool
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:24.280]   We now know where Marissa Myers been she's hanging out at Google. Well, sort of that's weird
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.320]   She's renting her old Google office
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.680]   Was what was it her old office? It was the original Palo Alto office, I think oh Google's old office at Palo Alto
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.280]   It's Google's old office. Oh, how funny that fabled one and down to Palo Alto
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.920]   She said she'd work there because she said every time I go up the steps. Yeah, it comes back big article
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.320]   This is actually not the one to look at let's go back to the New York Times article because this is this is a rehashed version of the big
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.920]   article in the New York Times about her and yeah, she says let me see if I can find the quote
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.400]   Because she says every time she goes up the steps it reminds her of the early days
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   There it is by the way great picture Marissa Myers. You know she looks relaxed happy. She talks a lot about Yahoo
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.640]   She said, you know, I had high hopes
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:18.200]   Of turning around Yahoo, but ultimately it was a legacy business and all I could do is slow down
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.120]   The death absolutely true. It was the last old media business. Yeah
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:33.600]   She she is looking I guess this is kind of to be expected to be invest I guess and be a
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.480]   startup person
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   Lumi Labs. Yeah, that's and Lumi is a Finnish word. It means snow. She says I like snow a lot
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.640]   It's a good that was that was that was a silly little quote. I'm like and I just love snow. I'm like, huh?
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.960]   Okay, so this is actually the office. She said where I started my career in 1999
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.240]   It's also where PayPal started. So there's a lot of good juju here
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.400]   Coming back reminds me of what Google felt like in these early moments. I remember this was a telling statement
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.440]   I remember running up those steps because if you didn't get here fast enough on Saturday morning
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.480]   Somebody in the world was going to get worse. So church results and it might change their life for the worse
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.960]   Wow
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:23.320]   I'm not running up. Anybody steps on Saturday morning. That's like the old Disney joke. If you don't come to work on Saturday
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   Don't bother coming to work on Sunday
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.120]   That's a good joke
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.000]   Uh, she talks about larry and serge in the early days. I'm glad the times asked her this
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.200]   She says larry and serge just yelled at us until we became what they needed us to become and get done
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.760]   What they needed to be done. And so I said look she was employee 20. I think right
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.520]   Look, I'm just gonna rinse and repeat that hopefully with less yelling
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   We ultimately brought in management coaches and all kinds of mentors
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.400]   Wow
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.600]   Wow, she said I always knew what larry and serge wanted. I knew what looked
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.920]   Good looked like to them. And so I never got discouraged by them saying wait
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.880]   I don't think this is ready or I think this is overly ready
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.560]   Overly ready
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:17.160]   At a startup you never really know when you should launch something so google but the built the philosophy of launching early and often try things out
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.480]   See what works
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:26.680]   She said the first phase of the company when you're tens of people the the idea itself either attracts people or it doesn't people are there because
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.960]   They think the problem you're trying to solve is just that important then
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.280]   Getting from 100 employees to 1000 you have to be very careful
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.960]   You don't want it. This was really interesting
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.160]   You don't want to pay them too much because you don't want somebody who's there
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.400]   For the wrong reasons you want to get people who are really aligned with the mission
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:52.600]   You make sure they're fairly compensated, but not necessarily motivated by that compensation. That's not truly more. Is it? No, well
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   She says that's up to a thousand
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.840]   She says then around a thousand people the culture and the mission becomes self-reinforcing
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.600]   At google I always ask new people why did you come when we were about 1200 people all of a sudden for the first time
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   I actually heard the answer I came for the culture
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.560]   She said I had a strategy both at google and yahoo of meat
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:19.480]   Salaries not beat salaries. It's the trade-off between this is a great line. It's the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:24.200]   You want a true believer is not somebody who's there for the money
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.960]   Mercenaries and missionaries. I love that
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.280]   As uh as for yahoo, she said well, I was I'd been working at google for 13 years
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:39.720]   She doesn't mention the fact that she was kind of demoted or pushed aside a little bit right before she went to yahoo
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.280]   I'd been on search for 10 of those years just recently made the change over to focus on maps
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:50.920]   Maybe this is her way of saying that and I was like, you know, I'm just not sure I want to be like the 50 year old search girl
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.840]   I always had huge respect for yahoo as a company
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.160]   When we were here in this office, we dreamed of maybe getting the yahoo contract maybe one day powering yahoo search
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.200]   In 1999 yahoo was the internet
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:11.080]   He said there's the problem there's the problem in 1999
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:17.720]   And I knew that while there were a lot of things going wrong for the board and leadership at yahoo
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.280]   There were a lot of really good people still there working on
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.600]   products
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.360]   She wanted she says to return it to the preeminence in its users daily lives where it used to be where people were on yahoo for half
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.280]   An hour and many hours a day
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.680]   I'm proud of what we achieved at yahoo that said we had a quickly decaying legacy business
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.040]   And all we really managed to do was offset the declines
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.240]   She talks a little bit about the activist
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.680]   Dan lobe and carlai can and how that was really focused on shortsightedness and
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.080]   She was mad because they forced yahoo to sell some of their alipaba steak
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.600]   Which would have been worth a lot more had they held held on to it
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:01.480]   She tells an anecdote about building something with her son with magnetiles
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:09.000]   Stacey you probably know it was her fun. Yeah, it's not lego, but what is it? It's like magnetic lego or like plastic covered magnets that you
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.480]   Build stuff with have like they're flat you build the i'm like deep deep deep deep
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.680]   She said we built this giant kind of castle complex and it collapsed and my son was crestfallen
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   I stopped and said son
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:30.360]   This is a teaching moment. There's nothing to be upset about we built it and it worked once and we'll just rebuild it
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:38.040]   Kid fail fast. Yeah often. Yeah, you're gonna regret words. She said that was one of my just don't become a civil engineer
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.360]   Yeah, right
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.440]   Because you don't want bridges to fail even once
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.680]   Uh, she said I would say one of my key learnings for yahoo is that timing is everything
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:54.760]   We could make the products really good, but regaining the contextual relevance that was afforded a yahoo in 1999 in the early 2000
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.080]   Was difficult difficult. Absolutely
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.680]   She said an interesting thing about me too. She said
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:06.360]   As important as these conversations are hope we're able to have them in a concentrated way fix the problems and then move on
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.760]   Because what I don't want to do is dissuade the next set of leaders entrepreneurs and executives from even entering the field
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.280]   I don't want us 15 years from now to turn around and be like wait, how come there's so few women vp's of these companies
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   Oh, right because in the summer of 2018
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.320]   All this me too stuff was happening. It caused people to say I'm not getting that business
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:32.760]   Okay, me too is everywhere. That's just asinine. Okay, there's no business said aside from this yet. That's a good point
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.080]   Come on. It's not just the tech industry
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.880]   even podcasting
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   Even in podcast even in podcasting
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.360]   What are some of your tips for perseverance when the chips are stacked against you?
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:52.440]   Develop a thick skin Bradley Cooper the actor once said if you ever want to feel really really bad about yourself go read about yourself online
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:19:00.600]   And then she quotes the last line of a book. I bet you've read your daughter rosy revere engineer
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:08.360]   Life may have its failures, but this was not it. The only true failure can come if you quit
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.400]   Yeah
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:19.720]   And scene so that's marissa my are back at it and I guess she's interview. It's a it's actually
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.920]   You know what? I've always liked Marissa respected Marissa and I wish her the
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   By all means the best what I loved about it was very colloquial and not forced not
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.680]   She didn't yeah back. This was hope there was no PR person. No, it was very genuine. It was good her. I thought
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.800]   Okay, I agree
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.920]   Kendrick Lamar wins a Pulitzer prize
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.280]   For music the first damn damn. That's right damn
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.880]   That's his that's what I don't know if that was the album the one but yes it is he uh
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.600]   He's the first hip-hop artist to win a Pulitzer
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:00.600]   You know traditionally the pollsters go to jazz and classical music
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.360]   You know slate did a wonderful it wasn't wonderful is too much slate did an interesting article
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.560]   They interviewed the two other nominees and classical music for the Pulitzer about Kendrick winning
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.920]   So it was kind of a fun article. That's interesting. What did they say?
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.800]   They basically were like dude
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.640]   He's awesome and we really like his work and one of them was kind of influenced by some of his stuff
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.160]   And they were really excited for him. Like Kendrick is not your typical rapper. He talks about
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.600]   uh
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.840]   Lot of stuff deep stuff real stuff
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.800]   Um, you know, it's it's it's it's hip-hop, but it's but I think that he is
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.640]   Absolutely a poet and uh and pushes the envelope. So and of course he got a Grammy, right?
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.880]   Album of the oh no, he didn't get a Grammy. He didn't get the Grammy. That was oh whoops
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:54.280]   Oh, but he got a Pulitzer slight somebody the New Yorker says kind of like Bob Dylan getting the Nobel Prize
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.040]   Yeah, that's actually what I thought of us like times are changing
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.480]   Yeah, isn't that interesting. He didn't get the Grammy, but he got the Pulitzer
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.160]   Wow that tells you something about the Grammys
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.080]   and then the can and can film festival saying well
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.680]   Netflix can't be in the can film festival because
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.640]   Their movies aren't on a screen
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.720]   in a theater
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.880]   Well, they're trying to force them to put them in french theaters and they refuse. Yeah
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.280]   They say okay. Yeah, I didn't mean to be any of them. They say cinema is a theatrical experience
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:35.960]   You didn't read it. I I just I I couldn't you couldn't care less the outrage. I could not care at all about this
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.880]   There's a little too much outrage in this world
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.400]   I'm sorry, but you know
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.120]   You're not in the Seattle and yet I have to say some of the stuff I like the myrrhowitt stories
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.920]   pretty amazing stuff
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.600]   Really good work being done by netflix and amazon and others
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.760]   And just because they're not shown in us in a theater doesn't mean they're not cinema
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.640]   Well that you know what that is gonna change
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.240]   Yeah
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.520]   I don't know how much that hurts uh netflix to not be a can
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:15.720]   Well, isn't there orson well's daughter or something something this these are the headlines that i've skipped so from the headlines
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.840]   Rip has something that they want shown
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.320]   his daughter
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.240]   Is pushing for this but it was a netflix deal netflix acquired it and she wants to shown it cans and the french are like no
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.400]   It hurts the creators it doesn't hurt netflix
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.760]   No, it doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. What do you know what does netflix get out of can nothing
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.680]   If you want a distribution, you know going to a festival is important, but they they are a distribution
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.320]   If you're but if you're trying to pitch your services to like a famous actor or director, they really want they want to be a cache
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.640]   Uh first they went golden something
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.760]   The first thing i can't then they want the cache
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.360]   Palm door the golden palm door. Okay
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.920]   the palm door
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.560]   Have you ever done uh can they no a few you probably have a credit you could have never have
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.640]   Stand there and you'll pop a russules
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   I go to vidcon instead vidcon is the you know what netflix same time go to vidcon instead
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.760]   Yeah, vidcon is much more much more with it much more you really it's fascinating to see the world change
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.120]   And and to see some people dragging their heels as it does
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.320]   Mm-hmm. I'm sympathetic
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:35.880]   So if you used google's new book search, I was trying to I was trying to sell it
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.720]   I used to go over the right question. I used it. So it was fun because um
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.080]   We were talking about this on twit, but we were also talking about
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.040]   individualism
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   versus collectivism and how
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.160]   The united states where we really have
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.720]   um
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   This sense of individualism
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.760]   You know is is has you know, I just learned that there are 176 million cameras in china
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:11.640]   Uh, did you see the 60 minutes on sunday about uh, how they they found a currency?
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:18.040]   Manipulator in china at a concert of 60 000 people with face recognition
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.000]   Yeah, he thought he'd be safe, but no
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.440]   Uh, I mean they're they're really moving fast in face recognition. So we talked about how did how did google
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.760]   book search get to this topic? I mean, I can't wait
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.880]   So I asked
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.120]   This is you go to a book stock google.com/talk to books and this is ray kers while he talked about it at ted this year
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:48.360]   Uh, he this is ray kers while and he said instead of doing a search you're gonna speak to it in sentences and you're gonna get any so
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.200]   I I can't remember what I wrote something like
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.560]   How does
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.800]   individualism
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.760]   Or us and I can't remember what I wrote collectivism
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.600]   affect
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   our views of
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.280]   privacy say
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:14.200]   That would be an interesting subject, right? How do individualism collectivism affect our views of privacy
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.520]   And look I got some really interesting
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.960]   And related
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.800]   Another way of thinking about individualism versus yeah, did you see that? Well, that's probably because it's cash
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.440]   Another way of thinking about individualism versus collectivism is to consider the degree of privacy a person seeks
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.960]   This is from oddly enough occupational therapy with elders
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.680]   But then there's steve and brier former supreme court justice steve a briars active liberty
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:46.120]   Others find connections between personal privacy and individualism and the privacy may encourage nonconformity and more free expression
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.320]   or
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.240]   Privacy impact assessment where that rolls off the tongue
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.000]   So this so that you know, I thought that was actually pretty good
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.400]   And if you're a student and you were thinking about these issues you would get some interesting references anyway
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.880]   I tried it for a question that i'm constantly trying to figure out and think about we talk about it a lot actually and I asked it
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   Does the u.s legal system focus on intent or outcome? Oh, that's good less
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:23.160]   Less about finding more for finding things to read because i'm trying to focus on what happens the u.s legal system
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.040]   So it pulled up the first two were not useful, but they started actually getting
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:35.880]   More useful over time including a book liability for crimes involving artificial intelligence systems. Oh, there you go
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:44.200]   Bring it home. This is good for research. So I just put in um, tell me about moral panic and technology. There you go bingo for you quoted
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.560]   Did you get anything good in there? Yeah, I did
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.880]   Yeah, I actually I was like, oh, this is kind of fun
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.400]   Also scary
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.360]   Well
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.800]   This is what journalists do
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.480]   One of the things i've really
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.120]   Been thinking about lately is you know artificial intelligence is like blockchain
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:14.680]   It's the thin spread of peanut butter that you put on top of anything you want to sell to the marketplace
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.240]   to make it sexy
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   And I really wonder
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.920]   You know, we we bandy this ai around an awful lot these days
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.800]   And I really wonder how close to
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.600]   I mean, are we is it really ai? I mean, is it really is it
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.640]   Or is it just a lysa
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.280]   There's there's words you can use like artificial intelligence can mean lots of things
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.680]   But if you do things like machine learning that actually means a very specific thing. Yes, so
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.160]   She's really what we're talking
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.680]   Maybe we should ask people to be a little bit more specific machine learning
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.680]   machine
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.560]   Machine learning is a method not a not an outcome
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:28:00.040]   Right and the outcome implies the outcome of artificial intelligence. I don't know if it delivers that outcome
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:07.320]   And it's also like how do we what kind of intelligence do we value and how do we like
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.560]   Computers are already
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.680]   Artificially intelligent when it comes to solving things like chest problems or integrams, you know
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.320]   So the chess is he playing chess well or even go well is really little more than math
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.160]   I think it's the ability well chess is
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.720]   The ability to force e and try the few chess is is absolutely math
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.320]   It's purely deterministic and computers when it chess with pure brute force
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.120]   Though the thing that was interesting about go is you can't win with brute force because there's too many combinations
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.800]   So you have to have some intuition about what a position means
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.880]   But i'm i'm not convinced that that's still not essentially
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:53.560]   Uh, they're but they're teaching themselves. That's that's what's interesting is the intelligence comes from teaching themselves
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.840]   And there's this idea that you can try I mean
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.080]   Being able to train a computer to recognize this on their own and work towards an outcome that you're asking it to work towards
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.160]   That's actually
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.320]   Pretty cool. I mean again. That's valuing one type of intelligence over another
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.880]   We could just not impressed with the progress we've made. Maybe that's really what i'm saying. Oh, we know
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.240]   And we you know and this comes up with self-driving cars now, right?
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.320]   um because uh, that's a form of uh, uh, what would you could za can I say that's a i?
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:31.800]   Self-driving cars. Yeah, I mean you'd say lots of things are a okay, but if you had level for autonomy
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.160]   That would be ai
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:42.440]   What people think of as ai if you give the car a goal and it gets there. I guess so I can't level for which
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.400]   What what is level for complete self-driving? What?
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   Oh, I thought that was level five. Well
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.880]   Forish five ish it's in there
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.200]   Or five is if you don't drive it don't kill anybody
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:57.720]   You're for okay. You kill it words me. You kill people after every 5,000 miles, you know, I just one of those
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:03.320]   Uh, price of progress. Well, what happened is we made a lot of remember the early days of the DARPA challenge, which is the
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.880]   Autonomous vehicle challenge in the very early days, which was only what 10 years ago
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.000]   The cars barely got a few feet. They would just go
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.160]   Drive right off the road
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.040]   Uh, it very quickly they advanced very quickly
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.400]   to be essentially self-driving all the way across the country within a decade
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.000]   but
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.680]   I think that might have given us
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.920]   False hope
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.520]   That's what technology does though. I mean think about when you had your first I don't know your IBM
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.240]   Selectrix and then suddenly you're moving
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.800]   I mean technology seems
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.000]   Clunky and not where you want it to be until suddenly you look around and you realize it is and that's
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.480]   That was invisible. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's then that is not frightening. But I feel like we're far from that
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.240]   I don't know what I'm saying, but maybe it is a hockey stick, right?
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.400]   Maybe it's it seems like we did a we did a lot really fast and now we're just stuck
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.560]   We're going through things in a gold penny
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:09.160]   Or because we're scared and I don't say we're scared. We're frightened of unknown outcomes
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.440]   Jobs are affected. Right. Our society has changed all these things and we feel out of control
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.720]   And then I believe we get back in control and then we're okay
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.360]   and the technology becomes
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   um ubiquitous and
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.120]   And just part of life
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.040]   And meanwhile google's selling diy AI kits at target
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.840]   Ai y so
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.200]   um
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.920]   I would say the technology and I'll just go back to this because this is
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.560]   near and dear to my heart um
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:44.680]   The technology got really good and now we're kind of in a space where we're trying to advance the actual underlying hardware
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.480]   and software governing AI
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:53.160]   So we saw this huge epic leap in like 20 from 2012 to 2015
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.600]   and facial recognition because we were like hey we can apply this to GPUs and
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.680]   Then we got new ways to apply it to more cores on a GPU
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.200]   so
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.200]   Right now where we are is
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.720]   We're now we've we've done all that work there now. We're trying to build
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.520]   New types of learning self-learning models for computers and that's gonna
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:21.240]   They're figuring that out then once they've got that they're gonna have to figure out hardware optimized for it because this still does take a lot of computing power
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.720]   so
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.160]   I don't think it's really a moral panic thing so much as it's like a we hit a technology wall and we're going there
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.320]   I don't know how I miss this AI. I think this is pretty cool from it is pretty cool
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.960]   They've helped us for a while. Yeah, I
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.920]   Said I can't figure out why
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:44.280]   Um, so the idea well, but they started selling in target which I think is right and they added a pie
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:49.400]   It's cut. Yeah, so it's got there's two of them ones for sound and ones for uh vision
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.280]   The sound one has a raspberry pi zero
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   the vision one has a raspberry pi two
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.640]   You could literally build your own intelligent speaker and experiment with voice recognition
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.080]   So how much expertise do you have to have in what area to do this?
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:11.800]   Well, see that's an interesting question. They they I think they're pushing it as a step part of a stem program, right?
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:19.000]   I think anyone can actually do this you you have to have it. You're not coding. You're not writing any code
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.640]   You are actually working through some code, but it's they show it to you
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.400]   So you can I don't know if you can cut and paste or if you just
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.360]   But it's not hard. Yeah
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.000]   That gives you a start
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.720]   In that the voice one's been around for a while the
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:42.200]   The other one is newer. I believe the computer vision one. Oh, I say so this also this just ties
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.600]   So I see one of the examples here that you showed was was
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:51.960]   picturing an apple and it's giving the probability so that's going so this is a this is a way to get into all of google's pretty
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.480]   cool, mendous
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.480]   pre tremendous
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.120]   apis
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.080]   And and yeah, I want to see how to teach my journalism students
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.560]   To tie into these this I think
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.480]   Either for fifth graders or journalism students you probably could do this
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   Not us we are too
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.960]   Yeah
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.360]   I think you should get one and make it on I will you know what let's order it. Let's uh, raw code
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.920]   Sport
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.800]   Yeah, no, I will buy this but I bet it isn't too hard
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.000]   And it really is up to the prof the teacher or the professor
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.160]   Uh to add the content that would make it more about AI and more about what's involved and stuff like that
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.680]   But at least you got all the hardware and you can interact with it and write code and
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.920]   That's what you're still project for stem education ideal for teens. You're right stacey
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.080]   That's what it says on the when you're on the buy page. Yeah
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:50.360]   Um, well they had put it out for kind of the hacker community about a year ago because we looked at it on the show because people are like
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.360]   Oh cool, but um
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:35:00.200]   I don't think it did super well there. I think uh, we should have a joy detector point the vision kit towards someone's face
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.080]   Ask them a smile. Ask them a smile really big as can make a frowning face
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.840]   And then of course they've already pre-programmed it with the machine learning
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.760]   To yield their photo and send it to the russian to us while you're at it. What could be the harm?
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.120]   Please
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.640]   I love it. She's working with the chrome book on this too, which is interesting. Oh, yeah, we need we need the new heath kit
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:32.600]   Uh, this is kind of the new heath kit. Yeah, that's what i'm saying. Yeah, oh, I love it. It's a cardboard. It's got that google, uh, you know ethos
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.360]   What is the cardboard? He's still they make stuff. Yeah, I did heath gets sure
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:44.520]   Heath kits. What is a heath kit? Oh my god. It happened again. Oh my god. I have to drink now
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.080]   Well, no now you can tell you the rest of your audience who who are maybe not as
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   We are
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:57.240]   Uh, heath kit. He's good still around their geek, but it was it was a great do it yourself build build a radio
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.680]   Build a guy get all the parts and the instructions. Yeah
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:08.040]   You have to do solder. Yeah, this is all hardware stuff. You know build a ham radio. That's the that's the ultimate heath kit thing
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Okay, yeah in fact
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.400]   Uh, I built a radio with my dad. Yeah, there you go. Maybe it was a heath kit. It's probably heath kit. Yeah
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.120]   uh in fact, uh our
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:25.720]   Uh guys at the uh ham nation show the hams have their own it's very much a heath kit build your own am
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.840]   Ham transmitter. It's called the pine board computer
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.520]   Um, if you go to bob hiles site hiles sound
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.080]   Dot com
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.400]   You can read about it click the ham radio section. Let me scroll down a little bit here
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.960]   I just put an image from an old heath kit catalog
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.600]   So this is as heath kit as it gets in fact it even has to have a warning
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.120]   Don't touch this it could kill you
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:57.160]   Um, and it has they have they sell the parts he danger high voltage that makes it exciting for kids
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.080]   And they have the circuit diagrams and you make and you build it
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   You build everything
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:09.080]   And then look at the look at this link. I sent you it's just too beautiful. It's an old catalog
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.680]   These were the these were the days were they this is memory american radio history
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:20.440]   Make a phonograph make it make a shortwave radio. That was what I always wanted to build a shortwave radio
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.600]   Yeah, but you could literally build your own
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.680]   Mediterranean old cabinet television for $119 nice
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.480]   Look at this. Oh, the catalog is just great. So stacey. You weren't born
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.960]   when this came out 1969 but
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.360]   um
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   There's a dw nurse president heath kit
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.760]   Why do millions build heath kit electronics?
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.560]   This was 1969 this does
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.800]   Really? I think this feels like 1949. I know it does doesn't it but the tv's are a little more advanced than that
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   They got a color tv's look at that. Oh
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:03.160]   state portable black and white tv for with a deluxe early american cabinet for $99.95
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.800]   Wow, I like the Mediterranean oak. I'm with you
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:17.240]   $450 two-year picture two warranty and optional remote control look at the remote control
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.080]   And this this is wired
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.520]   Oh
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:30.200]   Oh, but you know what before this stacey you're not going to believe this you had to get up out of your seat

[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.920]   Yeah, these were the but this was only 1969. That's what kind of blows me away
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.040]   in
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.120]   1976 a few years later my college
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.760]   roommate was building a kit computer in his dorm Wow
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.800]   Well, he'd he'd grown up building he's kids
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:07.080]   So yeah, it was this was right before the digital era began
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.960]   kind of the end of the line
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.320]   And you could even build your own
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   laboratory instrumentation
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:23.160]   I still had until two weeks ago. I still had a store near me where you could go in and buy you know resistors and capacitors and
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   And and special sense of plugs and cables. It was all this electronic stuff
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.040]   I don't know how they say it was well. He didn't say business. They just they just closed
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:36.360]   All these years who we goed in by resistors how halted just closed in us in
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.640]   San Jose, which was
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.600]   The place for that stuff and really really yeah, do you ever go to weird things?
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:51.640]   No, they just closed the weird things a warehouse in san jose somebody just bought it
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.360]   I think I missed or i'm sorry weird stuff pardon me
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.160]   weird stuff warehouse
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.800]   Was purchased by the outback equipment company. They sold all their assets and it's gone
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:10.280]   Says all the weird stuff. Yeah, it was just like I mean it was components. It was it was the best stuff ever
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.480]   You could still buy like components in such a fries though, right?
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.000]   Not really not like that. Not really not what it was
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.360]   Yeah
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.920]   And there's a place still a Palo Alto that you can go
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:28.680]   On 4th street where you can go in and you could buy one resistor or a diode
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.480]   Right, okay, but halted
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.200]   I don't I don't I think halted when I went out of business to which was I won the
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.520]   7th grade eighth grade science fair making electronic fun goes
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:46.200]   We still have okay
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.440]   Stacey's embarrassed for this Stacy. This is what we're talking about
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.840]   This is up the road apiece from us in
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.040]   Hsc electronics supply
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.080]   Probably you don't need a current sensor split core 10 millimeter 20
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.240]   But if you did you can buy that on spark fun and play
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.160]   Even digit
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.280]   Key digi whatever that's that's who's taken over for this is eight of fruit and spark fun in places like that
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:19.320]   Yeah, my dad my dad used to have all this stuff lying around and see you came by this honestly
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.680]   Yeah, was your dad a hobbyist or was you the he's an engineer at doubly
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.920]   I'm almost a geophysicist. So science really my dad was a paleontologist
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.440]   Oh
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.800]   Professor thereof, right? Yeah, um, yes professor thereof. That's right
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.200]   Uh
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.280]   And my mom was an ecodesiologist
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.960]   What's that?
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.800]   Um
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.560]   Grasshopper
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.120]   Grasshopper a learned to code app from google's area now we're talking software
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:03.080]   No, I was I was excited by this because it felt like dual lingo for coding. It's javascript, right? Yep
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.360]   Uh, so actually if you go to grasshopper.co let me do that grass
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.200]   Hopper code you can see it directly
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.160]   learned to code for free
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.880]   I guess it's a it's an app
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.200]   An app. I'm installing it right now. Yeah
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:25.640]   Welcome to grasshopper the coding app for beginners best way to start your coding adventure with fun quick games in your phone
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.120]   This is google's response to swift playgrounds
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:34.360]   Teach you to write real javascript moves move through progressively challenging levels as you develop your abilities
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.680]   Then graduate with fundamental programming skills for your next step as a coder
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.560]   No, it's so cute
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.240]   This is really neat area one accredited area 120. Yeah, that's a google
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.800]   Incubator or what
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.040]   I know isn't that kind of their secret place
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.560]   It's their secret place. I think it's they're like people who have cool ideas and let's build crazy new stuff
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.640]   It's their crazy new stuff thing
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.160]   Does google still do the 20 percent time thing?
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.440]   Yeah, but i don't know it's 120 percent
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:11.000]   Oh my god, there are tests in this you guys of course there's tests
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.200]   By the way, i'm still waiting to receive my final grade
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.240]   But I did complete
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.960]   my uh, my online class in coding
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.280]   Which I would actually highly recommend which language
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.960]   Uh, it's a big it's a student language specifically designed for teaching
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:36.120]   Good coding habits and they don't tell you, but it's really it's really based on this so I just had some folks in from um,
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.760]   google
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.560]   Ampe talking to a bunch of product and audience people here at cUNY
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:47.640]   It's one of them here all day. Oh and the argument was made at the end of the day that we should be teaching students to write amp
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.320]   There's a way to make them make content. No, how self-serving is that that is?
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.480]   No, i think it was actually somebody else in the room. Oh
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.360]   Well, tell them tell them no
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.720]   Although is google bringing with the new email. I don't know if we want to talk about this yet
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.440]   But the gmail update is that I read something about bringing the amp to gmail. Yes
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:14.040]   Oh, I heard a bit more about that today. Yeah, and it's it's really basically you can't do javascript and that kind of stuff in
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.000]   Gmail and it's a way to make gmail responsive
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.880]   I mean email and gmail responsive and updated has have any of you gotten that yet?
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.040]   No, but I got my inbox has a new feature called highlights
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:36.920]   Highlights highlights for children you have new highlights. Oh, what are highlights? Are they in box highlights important new email so you can read them first
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:43.720]   How they decide what's important whom you eat your personal or your my personal
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.840]   What's my is my app? Is my it's my
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.880]   Geeze your apps account. Okay. Yeah, because i'm like is it your regular gmail or your apps?
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.080]   It looks at which emails are you open what you reply to keywords that are emails you have already read
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:02.600]   So it's learning from what you use what you do. That's me. How is how is that different than the
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:09.480]   Priority to the priority. Yes. Thank you that yeah, I don't know because basically well because I use inbox
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:16.600]   It separates out updates from low priority from social and all that and then everything else that's left over is supposed to be
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.640]   Important but now there's important important
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:26.040]   If someone just wrote a story about uh, I think it was kill google killing inbox
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.440]   What?
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.880]   Yeah, so
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.640]   That would be bad
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:37.720]   That would be bad. Maybe it was a reddit so this is a reddit post but then I swear somebody just did a story
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   But maybe it was based on this thread
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.200]   Reddit is google stopping it
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.720]   Development at ass is google inbox stopping development submitted one year ago. Yeah
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:53.560]   Well, here's the here's the article what that's from Andrew central. Yeah, I don't know how we
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:48:01.320]   Yeah, so it sure looks like yeah. Yeah. No, that's link bait. I hope
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.440]   Oh
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.560]   On this very show you hated it was frightened to death
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.280]   Scared me
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   And you've changed your your tune
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.920]   I live love you to google
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:20.680]   Uh, well, so this new gmail. I guess is something like that on steroids. Maybe
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.720]   Well, uh, I thought it was just a de you I didn't realize there were gonna be new features
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.920]   That's funny. I tried to go to gmail and it took me to inbox
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.360]   Oh, that's interesting. I heard you talking
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.200]   Like but there's still there's a link on inbox to gmail
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.720]   Still the same
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   Well, it looks so old fashioned to me now. I know
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:48.680]   So you use my gmail. I don't use inbox. I tried to use it for a while and it just didn't work
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:52.040]   Yeah, you got you got even more freaked than I was. I remember you just you were like, yeah
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.920]   You know what I stopped using gmail entirely
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.280]   Oh, geez. What do you just you just you're just so contrarian
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   Are you already let me guess Leo you're using you door on
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.800]   No, no pine is a client. I do use pine, but that's not
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:14.520]   Fine as a client. That's not the server. I use fast mail, which is a nice i map paid i map service
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:20.280]   Uh, and I actually I like it. I can't show because it's kind of my email, but I actually like it a little bit better than uh
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.680]   Gmail part of really it's not gmails fault part of the reason I stopped a couple reasons
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.680]   I stopped using it one is it's not true i map
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.480]   But the other is because my email address gmail
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.280]   Which was simply loport at gmail.com turns out to be so generically french
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   That I was getting huge amounts of french spam in fact. I still
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.400]   In the middle of the night every night. I get some fake french account
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.360]   On my hangout saying cuckoo
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.560]   Close the mouth
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.960]   Because they think i'm french
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.920]   And then I think there were a lot of loports like people would
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.280]   Right, you know and twanette space loport at gmail.com
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:05.320]   So I was getting people's confirmations and tickets and also how does fast mail get rid of all that?
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:11.240]   I don't because it's not loport at gmail. I use my whole life right of course. Uh-huh. I'm not loport at gmail anymore
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:15.640]   So what I should probably do is this darned address at fast bill dot com. Oh, exactly
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.840]   I don't use a real address
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.080]   But uh, but I do use leo at leo ville, which has been my address for 15 years
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.240]   But that just forwards to whatever so what it used to forward to goo gmail
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:32.440]   For the spam filtering and then go from gmail to fast mail and then I realized I don't I eliminated the gmail and actually spam
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.320]   Went down because gmail was generating more spam than it was filtering
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.200]   Just kind of kind of annoying
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:43.560]   Um, do you want to see my uh final student project?
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.000]   Yes
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.080]   It's a space invaders. It's not it doesn't have any sound
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.240]   I'm just shooting at bad guys as they come down from the sky
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:02.760]   But you would think this was uh trivial, but it was 889. Oh, no, don't let them land leo
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.640]   I lost
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.600]   So that's it. I hope I get an a
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:16.520]   It's actually really fun. I'm really enjoying I like coding, but I'm gonna download this grasshopper
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:25.480]   I pro I've programmed for years. This is kind of me. Uh, it's kind of it's like when a native chinese speaker takes chinese
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.280]   It's just not really fair
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:34.200]   By the way that happened to me in college and it was really annoying
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:41.000]   I believe yeah, they come in there. It's they're rattling off chinese. I'm going knee
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.680]   How
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.560]   It is a difficult language. That's how I feel when I go to germany and and see a see a three-year-old
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.840]   Uh, but you speak german pretty well, don't you know I don't know
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:58.600]   You just give the impression you could say like so in zucherek fast
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.760]   Lijstungschützecht
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:07.720]   Why why why does google google maps now give directions based on fast food locations?
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.040]   Okay, that's awesome. I think it's I think it's any I think it's a lot of different kind of locations
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:19.880]   That's the grub hub local angle to this so this woman tweets so google maps instructed me to turn right after burger king
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.520]   hashtag mind blown
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.560]   Then scott tweets google maps told me to make a right right after white castle
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.360]   This really happened in the bronx
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.080]   Elizabeth writes google maps told us to turn left at taco bell. We were so confused
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.640]   You drive into taco bell
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.040]   By the way, have you had the naked egg breakfast taco?
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.080]   What no no
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.240]   Provide good breakfast tacos jeff
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:53.880]   No, it's really good because you know what it is. I don't even provide that in Austin because they know we would egg
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.360]   Is the taco shell? Oh
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:01.560]   How do you hold you gotta look this up? You gotta look this up this is what?
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.400]   Oh taco bell
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.040]   It is the greatest or you can get it dressed which is to say that it has like a
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:15.320]   It's not naked anymore. Yeah round it, but how do you eat that doesn't that get all over your hands?
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.160]   It comes a little no comes in a little holder wait, but there
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.760]   I gotta look at them. Yeah, this is karsten
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:28.600]   Yeah, you know by the way stop karsten because this bugs the hell out of me every time I go to a site now chrome says
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.160]   Has that allow blocked you want taco bell to send you notifications?
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.840]   Can we turn a way to stop that? I don't want that. How do I stop that?
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:42.760]   Stop notifications on because I don't want taco bell sending me gosh darn notifications
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.960]   Oh
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:49.800]   You can get nacho cheese sauce. Oh, look at this. Look at this build your own customize it now
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.840]   Would you like bacon cheese nacho cheese sauce?
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:59.640]   Extra nacho cheese sauce pico de gallo. Oh, that's a popular upgrade guacamole yum
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.520]   creamy jalapeno sauce
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.360]   And then you can get uh, there's an ad on you could put egg in the egg
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.960]   Like some egg on my egg on my eggs bad eggs. I like a little steak
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:18.280]   And god knows why reduced fat sour cream. Why why start reducing fat now?
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.080]   Right. It's I you know what?
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.320]   You can be extra nacho cheese sauce
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.520]   I had a meeting. I was late. I had to drive on the on el camino
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.760]   I had to have breakfast and I thought well, you know, they have this. Let me go in and just try it
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.440]   So I can talk about it in the show
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.000]   And it's actually good. Is it really an egg or is it an egg product? That's my question
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.240]   Look at that. It's got a yolk on it. It's an egg. That's like suspiciously
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.120]   Symmetric yolk
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:52.680]   That's by the way, you you know that right that a lot of places don't use real eggs in their eggs
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.520]   You know, they have an egg product. They pour out of a little carton
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.840]   Egg eaters
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:05.160]   Well, but it's no, I don't know, but I mean fast food eggs are often not from a actual egg
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.280]   But i'm telling you this is actually pretty good
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.840]   Stacy's so disgusted or we can go back to the
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:21.480]   Well, how did they get to 310 calories fast really very fast? No, because it a single egg has 78 calories
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.360]   Okay. Well, look at those home fries
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.520]   bacon
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:32.920]   Oh, this I thought this was the naked. I thought it was the eggs the eggs only naked on the outside on the inside the nuggets
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.000]   Yeah, he's false. Okay. Yeah, they never mind. I got you
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.880]   I think you're right the naked egg taco shell is made of cage-free egg whites cage-free egg yolk soybean oil
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:52.680]   Water food starch salt black pepper natural butter flavor. Okay get ready for this at starbucks
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:56:01.240]   The the egg in their bacon gouda and egg breakfast sandwich is a frittata egg pan eight patty that contains soybean oil and water
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.880]   Unmodified cornstarch xanthin gum citric acid and powdered cellulose
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:12.120]   Burger King's breakfast menu describes their eggs as liquid egg pasteurized mixture
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:18.440]   Made with eggs water xanthin gum citric acid medium chain triglycerides and more
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.920]   Yeah, this is actually propaganda from panera
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:29.640]   Which wants you to know that they put actual eggs on their eggs
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:37.080]   Yeah, this is from the today show. This is an article
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.160]   From the today show that is really a press release from panera bread
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.760]   Boys
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   That's kind of shocking
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:53.240]   All right, so anyway, so so google will tell you to turn left at the taco bell after you drive into the taco bell
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:59.560]   Then it'll give you this did you see the ad for taco bell? No, will it that is that is not what's happening?
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:04.120]   Jeff is you know what I want you know what I want though. I want to say i'm going to your moral panic
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:11.800]   I want to say that's it's ad panic marketing panic. I want to say find me the nearest starbucks on the way
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:17.720]   I wanted that feature for ages. Well, well the next accident is 10 miles off the exit
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.080]   But the exit after that it's only two miles off the exit. I wanted to give me
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:27.400]   Choices it doesn't do that just don't go to the starbucks. What is it main ninth when they're all closing to for
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.440]   Well, how not to be prejudiced?
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:34.760]   Okay, wait, wait, I want to talk about this google thing because it's actually useful. Okay
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:38.840]   But then we can talk about starbucks. I'm gonna. I'm gonna while you're doing that
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.760]   I'm gonna find the video that a viewer sent us of of you punching me
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.760]   Oh, yes
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:51.080]   Okay, but what google's doing is there this is basically to make your directions sound more like people actually give directions
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.040]   Which is like turn left at the burger king or the bank
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:57.800]   And I just think that's useful because I can never tell my right from my left. So
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:04.680]   And i'm really bad with landmark. So i'm very excited. Nice. That is all I think this is nice
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:09.160]   And yes, they could they could do a hella job marketing things, but
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.960]   So the data they have there
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:15.640]   Well, they have all that data from ghoul and they have street maps. Yeah
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.760]   So I have the weirdest thing with google maps
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.240]   It puts my house
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.800]   Four houses back on the road and doesn't recognize where my house is
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:32.440]   Is that like does it show you in your house at the wrong place?
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.600]   No, it says
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.320]   Your house does it for house early it says welcome
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.720]   Well, here's the problem I have I try to set it up so that so that that's a trusted location
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.600]   It won't do it. It doesn't recognize that part of the earth. I'm in a black hole. I don't exist
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.840]   You need to do your what are those codes the six digit eight digit
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:54.760]   qy pizza zen oven 16p
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.560]   What are those three words?
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.720]   Oh
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.720]   What three words
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.240]   Yeah
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.560]   It can you does that work for you? I don't know
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.880]   You should try it
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.760]   Because that's a real problem jeff. I'm sorry you do that it is a real problem
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   Can you google apps?
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.760]   Uh, yes, you can but what is it someone help me out here?
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.840]   I'm just gonna start jebrushing
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.800]   You can't you can't you have to do it from what three words and then it sends you to google maps with a gps coordinate
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.040]   But don't google created one?
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:30.120]   Oh google has their own. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, but it's like really obscure. It's like weird
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:33.720]   It's like we played with it on the show. Yes. Hmm. Okay
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:39.480]   That's I was trying to help you out jeff, but you can correct google maps can't you you can I think there's a way
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.480]   I don't know how in that case to say you say I don't exist but here's where I exist. Yeah
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.120]   Because my google maps has next order
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.680]   That's google stuff plus doc codes
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.120]   Plus codes
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.160]   Okay
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:56.040]   My google maps my next door neighbor my old next door neighbor ran a business called party boats austin
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.880]   and
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.520]   It wasn't that duck thing where that goes in land and then goes in the water. No, it's not. I love duck tours
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.400]   Don't don't knock my dr. I've got a quacker
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.040]   And i'll use it. I know I remember you used it on me
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:14.120]   They um, I can't I can't say that those guys have moved and they have not changed their address
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.880]   So every time I come home, it's like google's asking me to tell me my experience a party
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.240]   I was party boats. I know which drives me bad me too. We have a
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.840]   Business near us and it's always asking and saying are

[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.000]   Tell me about it drive by a mcdonald's and it says this is a good opportunity to take a photo no
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.200]   It's not
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.960]   They don't have the hand egg sandwich
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.720]   All right, naked the naked naked
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:48.280]   Taco okay, they could egg mike boas who watches the show. Hi mike mad dog movies made us

[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.960]   Nice, I was envisioning something hitting you in the arm
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:58.040]   Not your actual no, I was figuring this call, but oh, okay. Jeff's much more delicious like
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.520]   Hey

[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.760]   Google is drafting ethical guidelines for working with government
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.720]   Is that an oxymoron?
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.600]   Well, the puzzle the google and ethics or government
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.560]   You take your pick google
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.080]   Boral bedding
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.560]   Diane green whose cloud boss according to cnb zan on cloud boss diana green
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.040]   Is said to have expressed regret that those principles were not in place before google signed its contract
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.600]   This is that contract that the employee petition was complaining about with the dod
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:45.720]   Uh and said that these new ethical principles will be in place before it commits to any similar work
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.240]   Nice
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.600]   Um
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.240]   Now I don't see what the principles are so
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:03:00.520]   Which is right in them. Oh, she's writing them. They're in progress. Yeah, so when when the principles emerge
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.400]   from diane's pen
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   We will
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.680]   Talk about them
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:15.240]   Whatever they may be what would you you know, do no evil is not quite enough these days. I'm afraid
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.640]   Well, I would say
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.200]   What so let's talk about this so so that the company shouldn't use this technology to kill people
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:29.560]   Well, they said and that their policy was only to help with defensive not offensive weapons and I think that that's defensive drones
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   Uh, they could shoot down missiles. Yeah
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:42.040]   Star Wars. All right, that's fair. That's fair. I'm just I'm trying to think the problem is that you create that and there is an offensive
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.240]   Potential for it. Yes, everything has both offensive and defensive potentials
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:53.000]   Was wasn't the information the case they were complaining about wasn't that uh photo
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.960]   recognition which was here to be targeting
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.520]   right well
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:04.920]   You could argue that you could deploy something at the borders to keep people you know or bad out. Mm
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.520]   That would be somewhat defensive
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.680]   Um, no anybody who actually believes that it might be unethical right?
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.080]   Unless it's a giant red boxing glove on a spring
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:24.920]   Yeah, that's funny leo not funny
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.920]   I mean, this is actually this is the flip side that you always argue like think about data collection
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:37.240]   Jeff you talk about this a lot. There are so many good uses of data collection. So you could create principles around
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.680]   That so maybe you collect satellite data
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.240]   for
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:48.200]   Like they could be used for nuclear disarmament or something, but you wouldn't do it for
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.560]   Targeting people. I don't know
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.160]   So scoop here karen mcdugle
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.920]   My boy playmate is now released from her contract with american media ink and is able to talk about her
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:07.720]   Oh trump. This is the one that the national acquire, which is am I american media ink paid 180,000 something
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:13.240]   She is now a lot of money for the exclusive rights to the story, which they never published
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.040]   which has the I think quite poetic name of catch and
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.800]   What is it buy and catch catch and hold?
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.880]   Pay and catch catch and release something like that catch and release is something that's fishing
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.440]   This is not fishing
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.520]   It's also immigration thing, isn't it?
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.720]   It is isn't it catch and release. Yeah, that's I don't think that's the official term for it
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.720]   But I think that some call it that
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.880]   So i'm just sorry that was a little bit of breaking news for twitter there speaking of maps
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:50.760]   Apparently people are complaining that ways is routing them up very steep hills
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.160]   No, the people who live on that very steep hill and the city of los angeles are complaining
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.800]   Not the people getting routed people don't mind driving up the hill. It's just that the people live on the hill
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:07.480]   Well, so they have actually quite a legitimate complaint at first i'm like, uh, shut up and stop your winnings
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.320]   But I read the story
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.960]   And 32 percent grade is that pretty steep
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:20.040]   Yeah, it's crazy on bard street and uh services go so uh the residents of baxter street
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.800]   a 32 grade that goes back to the 19th century
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.520]   are upset
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.200]   that uh 27
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.920]   Numerous applications
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.240]   seem to route people up this street and they're worried about auto accidents
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:44.920]   These people have actually had accidents like somebody like somebody had two cars in their front lawn and I mean
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.280]   Those are actually like if this happened in a city
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.640]   Your city would actually install speed humps or something to
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.480]   Well, that's cool response. The goal's response is we'll do it if the city
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.800]   restricts it
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.160]   But until the city does something we're not going to do it. I think they're they're right
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:06.360]   So filbert street in san rasisco has a 31 percent grade. Oh, that's a very strong. Okay, steeper
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:11.080]   They're in 1996. Uh, david letterman released, uh tons of um
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.800]   watermelons
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.400]   Here here's a picture of one of those super stretches trying to go down back to street and bottoming out
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.480]   So there's there's problem number one
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:29.000]   Um, it is fairly steep. This is from 1937. That's fairly steep
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.320]   In fact
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.680]   It was in the little rascals. Here's something else stacey won't remember
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.520]   Nope, uh 1930s, uh little rascals
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.640]   Not enough to remember either stacey. They had a derby a race down uh that street
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:50.440]   In the 50s automobile manufacturers sent new models up the slopes of baxter streets to show how powerful their new engines were
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.840]   Uh more recently baxter set the stage for legendary skateboarder don nuggy new yen
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:03.800]   Yeah, wens incredible run which went viral last year. You want to watch his his bomb hill drop
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.240]   If you have vertico
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.880]   You might not want to watch this. This is from thrasher magga. I do you know me bridges nuggy's first thought you should never ever
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.800]   Challenge nugge any nugge. Sorry. Sorry dude. Do it
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.600]   That's back to street. It doesn't look that steep. I could do that
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:27.640]   But in fact, that was the only way when I was a kid I could skateboard
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:33.400]   Is that like we had a hill that steep and I would that's the only way I get enough speed up to stand up
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:39.000]   I've had no desire even once that's nugge. I've been trying to bomb it. He'll but he's gonna bomb it man
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.040]   Okay boy. They really build up the tension
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.680]   Oh, look here's some pictures of a school bus bottomed out first pulled up. He pulled up at the top
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:54.440]   He'll he says oh he's bombing. Oh, he's bombing. Oh, he's crazy. Oh, nudge. You're crazy
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.920]   I wanted to try it out. You know, just to check you craigslist. Please
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.680]   That would have manufactured danger. You're the little resentio. So that's nothing compared to san francisco broadrick
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:13.400]   Broderick broadway in belayho. Yes. I know broadrick 30 percent. Here's nudge. Uh when he was younger
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.520]   Going down the street
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.480]   This is the little rascal stacy. You see what you've been missing
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:22.600]   Yes
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:28.840]   Now this is filmmaking and it's finest. It sure is great special effects and the acting
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   Oh, oh, oh, there's buckwheat
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.240]   Ain't got no breaks. Wow. Okay. That was fun
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:44.120]   Anyway, uh, backster street people don't drive up it if you get if ways tells you to go up there
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:52.200]   Storm to it. Don't do it. I drove a i'm such an idiot. I had a stick shift car in san francisco
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:58.600]   Oh, yeah, that is don't do that. You know what? You know, it's great up the hills of san francisco at tesla
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.040]   Really it's easy peasy because
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.440]   Stacey, you know this if you press the brake a little hard it puts it on the emergency brake
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.240]   It just locks and you can take your feet off the pedals and sit there
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.000]   And then because there's so much torque in it when you're going and you could be like this
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.720]   And you just put the accelerator now and you just go up
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:20.280]   Yes, that's how I slammed through a fence thanks to my pedal error
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.920]   So much
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.480]   Really what did this happen recently?
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.800]   Oh, no, this happened like a year and a half ago. This is why all this is why I say all the tesla
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.240]   Is you see them all like going through windows and stuff and it's because
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:39.480]   When you mess up you really mess up you really mess up big time. You got you got a lot of torque
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:45.240]   It's hard and fast. Yeah, you're going fast when you when you mess up. So is tesla in trouble or not?
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   Uh, no, there's the chidiots. Oh, there's good news
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.360]   They just announced that they're going to go to 24 hour production for the model three and they're going to be able to do
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.840]   What is it 6,000 a week? Oh, I was talking about the nts
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.160]   Oh, this whole thing over the self-driving car. Yeah, I'm like god
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.080]   They're kind of in a you don't get in a shooting war with government agencies
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:14.360]   You're not especially especially after you've had multiple accidents. It doesn't look the optics aren't good
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.680]   And I and I really I agree they should not call it
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.560]   autopilot it really
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:28.120]   And it shouldn't be treated as an autopilot. It should be treated as kind of fancy cruise control with lane change capabilities or something like that
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.720]   That doesn't sell as well. That doesn't fit on the little dash but
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:37.960]   But but when you buy a tesla you understand that there's some hyperbole involved. They call the air filtration system
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.600]   the bio hazard
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.600]   And it has a big bio hazard logo on it
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.480]   It's it's part of the fun of being a test and it's called insane mode and ludicrous mode
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.840]   You should understand there's a little bit of hyperbole going on with the marketing. That doesn't work so well with lawyers
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:04.360]   Well, and it doesn't work well with everybody. I mean you tell somebody that they can keep their hands off the wheel
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.160]   they're gonna keep I mean
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.480]   Driving for many people is very boring. Here is uh, here is david letterman
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.640]   rolling
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:19.720]   Rolling what was these pink pong balls down broad versus melons? I think melons. I don't know. Oh various things
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.880]   I various things just rolling them down
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:26.920]   That's the steepest that up. Oh man. Well, they have it. That's what interns are for
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:33.560]   Looks like they put a wall at the bottom or wall now man. Okay. I think I think he did other things. Yeah, there we go melons
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.200]   That's fun
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   That's actually that was tv
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.200]   Yeah, those were the days where tv was great. Do you remember this stacy? Do you ever have you ever heard of david letterman?
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.640]   Yeah, he has a a Netflix show
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:53.720]   And paul macartney used to be with a group called the beetles. I know
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.080]   Wings that's right
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.680]   All right
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.920]   I'm you know if you're gonna make fun of us being old i'm making fun of you being young. It doesn't have the same exact
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.400]   I'm not I'd just turn 40
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   Wow
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.080]   Wow, happy birthday. Did you have a good birthday? We saw the balloons
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.680]   Yes, I got okay
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.440]   This is super nerdy, but I went to a restaurant called uchico for my it's in Austin. It's delicious
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:27.080]   Um, so we went and do you know what uni is yeah love uni. I love it. Me too. I love it. It's one of my favorite
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   It's expensive, but it's my birthday. So I like i'm gonna treat myself
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.040]   I got a piece and then I was gonna finish my meal with another piece
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.320]   And instead they brought out a flight of uni. So they brought out a sanabarb or uni
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:46.440]   One from the hokaido uni from japan and then one that also had like salmon roe. So it was so awesome
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.080]   Uni is an ugly
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.240]   But maybe it is ugly and if you know what it is, it's also doubly disgusting
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.480]   Is it related to snails? It is uh sea urchin codenets
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:03.960]   Yeah, I've never been fond of uni. I love it. I love it too. It's so delicious
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.200]   It looks like a baby. Yeah, I really wish I didn't know much about it
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   I'll have some uni for you when i'm in japan
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.360]   Oh, there you go. You know, it's funny is i'm the only one in the family who likes sushi
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.520]   So i'm gonna i'm gonna have to trick them into going to some sushi spots
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:24.920]   Oh, well a lot of the japanese places they'll have other things that are maybe yeah, they they you know, michael loves ramen
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.080]   So he'll be able to eat
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.440]   I'll be at least the love's tempura. She'll be able to eat it'll be fine
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.360]   Uh
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:42.040]   Android p we were talking a lot about this on all about android earlier this week looks like android might be copying iphone 10
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.680]   with the gestures
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:51.080]   You know what i'm happy if they do because the gestures in the iphone 10 are actually the best thing
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.760]   About iphone 10 is a very natural way of moving around
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.600]   New navigation bar similarly to the iphone 10 with a swipe up gesture
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.480]   To reveal the multitasking ui instead of the recents button
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.400]   Um, so we how can they get rid of the recents?
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.200]   You swipe up instead
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:15.400]   Oh, I see very natural now. I hope they have the best thing about the iphone the absolute best thing
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.720]   Is instead of even worrying about recents you just swipe along the bottom to go to the previous app
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.760]   Just like that. It's very natural
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:31.320]   See how natural that is you just i want to see because sometimes i get up with 20 apps run and i just want to see what they are
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:35.480]   Well, you can still do that. That would be the theory is you would be able to do that
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.600]   I don't know. Why do I how do I get to all of the apps?
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.720]   Well, google's presentation may may look different than this
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.000]   Yeah, but how do you get to all the apps by
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.560]   I found by swiping up
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.600]   You see a little bit and that so that's what they're thinking that this is all from pre-release android p stuff
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.200]   We know we're gonna find out google. I know is three weeks away
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.560]   Exactly three weeks away hard to believe three weeks away
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:07.480]   Uh, I will be I will have just come back from vacation
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:13.240]   Uh, we will be doing I think we're i you've been contacted. I hoped are we moving twig? I think we are
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.440]   Oh, I didn't know this because i'm going i'll be. I know this either
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.920]   Well, okay. So the problem is that microsoft build is the same time
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.880]   I'm at build physically really yeah, so i'll be at build on monday and tuesday so monday. We're doing
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:35.480]   Uh, the build keynote monday morning and then in the afternoon. We're doing windows weekly normally right before this show on wednesdays
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.840]   Right, uh tuesday is google ios keynote. So we'll be doing that move either
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.800]   Which means we'll move ios today and mac break weekly to wednesday in the
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:51.160]   Traditional windows weekly slot, but I guess this won't affect twig will it so we'll do twig on tuesday
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.520]   Twig will be on tuesday. I'm being told
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.360]   It's so funny usually when you say i'm being told you you're listening in your ear
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.320]   In order for me to be told i think i have to take my ears out
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.080]   What why'd you say because i have these
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.680]   Ceiling ear will be tuesday afternoon. Oh see now it's in my ear
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.320]   Tuesday afternoon, so
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.080]   Maybe so why are we doing that because we could do it on uh, it's normal time, couldn't we?
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.480]   Uh, we could or you want to be
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.560]   Which would you guys prefer? Oh, it'll be closer to the keynote closer to the keynote
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.720]   I'm going to be on a plane on wednesday when y'all are recording. How about tuesday?
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.120]   Will you be in your hotel room waiting for us to call?
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:34.280]   Um, it depends i don't have my full build schedule build. I don't need to do this on the air. We can do this after the show
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.080]   Sorry, we can't do it. I'm trying to do anything quite fast. It is
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:42.280]   Well, I do want to be able to tell them when the shows are i do want to be able to tell them when the show will be but we will
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.840]   We'll let you know that who's filling in for me next week in the week after mr. Carsten bondi producer
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:52.600]   We will have uh, Jason howl hosting okay from all about and right Jason to be hosting the show in the next couple of weeks
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.680]   And then trying to get Jason to do dangerous things
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.120]   Hopefully next week we'll have uh, jon donovan in the place
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:05.320]   We've got i will not be we've been trying to get jon because she is an expert on how memes are used to shape political opinion
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.880]   She works in data boys
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.080]   Think data and society data and society her think tank
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:16.200]   And really we love her. She's great. Yeah, i'm sorry. You won't be here because i know you what are you?
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   Was johnny i'm sorry
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:24.920]   You look like you were upset. Yeah, no, I don't mind yawning. I yawn all the time. You can yawn. You don't have to cover your mouth
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.400]   Yeah, i'm jump. Why yes you do
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.640]   So google has i mean tesla has now been so
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.880]   inflammatory
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.440]   To the ntsb that they've been banned from the crash brobe
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:42.360]   And then after that well, so i this the sequence of stories is crazy like
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.560]   They they were dueling with one another tesla
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.320]   I think tesla's being a little unfair to the guy who got killed in the crash
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.600]   Saying things like well he didn't have his hands on the wheel for six seconds
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.680]   You tell me stacey my experience with autopilot is
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.760]   It's doesn't have any magic sensors in the wheel that knows when your hands on there
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:06.440]   You actually have to jerk the wheel a little bit so i can have my hands on the wheel the whole time and it says put your hands on the wheel
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.760]   So i actually have to go
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.400]   Just to let it know is does that your experience or does it know your hands on the wheel if it's just lightly resting there
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.920]   Um, my tesla is so old it does not have a lot of oh you don't know
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.840]   So i think this is a little unfair and certainly tesla knows this
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:28.600]   Um, the guy could easily have had his hands on the wheel another question is why he didn't notice that the tesla was veering into the guard rail as it had done
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.800]   Before and he would serve before like i've driven other people's cars with autopilot and
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:39.960]   At some point you're like well i'm gonna decide to trust this because it's worked in the past mistake
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.680]   So i can see how you could be like oh oh oh oh
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:50.680]   Yeah, I think it's really unseemly of tesla to put out public press releases saying
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.440]   Well, he didn't have his hands on the wheel. He wasn't paying attention. That is not nice
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.320]   Like imagine if that were your dad. Yeah
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   I think this is why ntsb says look, you know what uh really it said the quote from the ntsb
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.800]   releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.920]   Insumptions about the probable cause of a class of a crash
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.080]   And that is why we're revoking tesla's status as a party in the probe
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:21.400]   They too many public releases and I think that's completely appropriate tesla's gonna play
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:25.160]   Now i'm gonna file a complaint with congress
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:32.920]   Contending that it's in its own statement the ntsb is quote more concerned with press headlines and actually promoting safety
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.920]   I
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.560]   Actually think going after the ntsb is kind of a jerk is kind of an odd move because
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:43.320]   Out of all of our public agencies, they're actually pretty
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:50.280]   They're not hated by anybody. Well, you know and as as this article from nbc points out tesla has really been
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.240]   blaming the driver
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.440]   Yeah
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440]   So and come on
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:00.680]   So yeah, I don't know
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.600]   Yeah
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.600]   So
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.840]   So we will watch with interest. I mean, I look at somebody who uses autopilot a lot
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:16.200]   I've had the experience of the car pulling into obstacles putting pulling into in particular construction
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:22.360]   Uh road division if it can't see the lanes and you grab the you know, you're holding the wheel and you grow it pull it
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.520]   The other way you say no and you disengage
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.360]   And I have disengaged my autopilot my tesla numerous
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:33.160]   Our family think of you using autopilot lisa refuses to use it and she doesn't like it when I use it
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:36.760]   But now but I will say I believe it's safer
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:42.680]   because uh, I I think that momentary and attention is less likely to cause a crash
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:47.720]   And that that can be a problem as you as your driver especially on long distances
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.920]   I love on highways. I turn it on I pay attention keep my hands on the wheel
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:56.280]   But it's just one more way i'm avoiding running the guy ahead of me because because it won't do that
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.600]   Uh staying in the lane even you know if my attention wanders or whatever
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.880]   Uh, it's just help you shouldn't rely on it, but it's but it's a very helpful tool
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.400]   And I think it makes me a safer driver. I feel more safe behind the wheel
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:15.160]   But that's because I also pay attention. You can't you can't you can't let you can't say oh the car's driving
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.960]   I'm gonna read a book. You can't do that. I can I don't think I could pay attention if I weren't actively driving
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.840]   I think that would be a fear as a remind. Don't use uh cruise control. I hate cruise. Oh, well. You wouldn't like this
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.760]   This is just I'm not a huge cruise control on steroids. I use it even in traffic
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:36.600]   I love it, but I'll tell you why it's great is stop and go traffic cruise control on the Tesla and many new model vehicles
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.240]   Uh will stop and go
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.560]   So it maintains a safe stopping distance and maintains speed it does
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.160]   I mean, I've never had a problem with it. Not seeing the car in front of me
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:53.400]   So that's a really great way of kind of you don't have to keep your foot on the accelerator going back and forth and break
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.840]   Accelerator break disorder
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.400]   You could take your feet off the pedals still paying attention
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:04.280]   And it will automatically keep a safe safe stopping distance and and speed up and slow down appropriately and stop and go traffic
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.280]   That's I think huge
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.120]   So I am not against Tesla's stuff. I just don't I think that
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.440]   They should probably be at greater pains to remind people it is an autopilot
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.000]   and uh
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.640]   And people should learn if you've got it. Don't don't you know, don't let it do the driving. You're still driving
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.200]   Meanwhile waymo has requested and received permission
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:35.640]   This is not a timely announcement from the california department of motor vehicles to take the safety driver out of their cars
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:41.000]   And drive fully autonomously at starting on the streets of mountain view where google is
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.400]   I thought they already were doing that because they had a safety driver
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.760]   They still have a safe driver now those christmas many vans would be
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:56.200]   Powering around town with nobody are they still driving those little funny looking little no things are many vans. These are christlers
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:01.960]   Oh, but if you're a pedestrian mountain view just we're rewarding. You might really want to look both weights carefully
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.040]   Yep
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.000]   Because before talking well here's my here's my concern
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.400]   They talked waymo was you know said immediately. Oh, you see uber they have a disengage. What was it every 13 miles?
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.920]   We only have a disengage once every 5600 miles disengage means the safety driver took over
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:27.320]   But once every 5600 miles means in this car without a safety driver once every 5600 miles is going to do something bad
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.440]   That's not good
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:37.560]   Or the human being was wrong and shouldn't have disengaged. Oh, maybe maybe that's their position is oh no that was a mistaken disengage
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.480]   I don't know
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.880]   I mean, I don't I nobody denies cars drive better than humans already
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:50.360]   But there are plenty of situations these self-driving vehicles are not ready for that the human has to take over
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:55.080]   And I worry that in mountain view these cars will be plowing through those situations
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:01.560]   Are they do are there limitations? I'm when you can't like during rainy or weird weather. I'm sure there are yeah
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.080]   Let me look in certain hours. You can operate without a safety driver
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:12.200]   I don't know. I mean we have to we have to get there if we want to actually create autonomous cars
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:15.480]   Of course, we have we should get there when we're ready. We shouldn't we shouldn't push it
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.920]   Only two companies have applied for such permits Waymo and some other company
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:26.840]   According to source familiar with the matter. This is the San Francisco Chronicle Waymo plans to start testing near its mountain view headquarters
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:33.720]   Over time it will expand the testing of autonomous cars with no backup driver notice they call it backup not safety
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.600]   to more of the bay area
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:45.480]   The waymo's approach will be to extensively map a train by having vehicles with test drivers cover at first before using driverless vehicles
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:52.440]   Uh, let me see we have a lot of confidence says john craft chick ceo of waymo
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:58.360]   That our technology would be robust and would be able to hand sit you handle situations like the one in arizona
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:07.800]   See meanwhile, I want tami joe shultz to be driving me wherever I go. Yeah, because tami joe needs a job. She's a nice person
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.080]   No, you know who tami joe is. Oh, it was like who is tami joe shultz when tami joe shultz
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.760]   Is the amazing pilot nerves? Oh, yes
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:26.040]   Oh, yes the southwest lady the southwest jedon first fatality since 2009 and commercial airline traffic and it's right before I get on a plane
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:33.160]   I'm well, that's this makes it statistically even less likely. Oh, yeah, good. That's right. Oh, i'm safe
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.480]   They got it out of the way. It's actually a tragic story
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.520]   Uh, the southwest flight from new york to dallas
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.480]   I had a catastrophic engine failure and I guess
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.720]   Trapped all from the engine pierced the window of the plane in a passenger was
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.200]   Partially sucked out the window straight out of a james bond movie
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:59.720]   Uh, was that the person who died? Yeah, yeah, the other passengers pulled her there were seven other minor injuries the other other passengers pulled her back in
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.680]   And she survived that but she died of a heart attack shortly thereafter
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.120]   And but of course you're you're praising the pilot
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:16.200]   Who everyone praised the she was a sully of the sullie of that's why I hope her nickname is shultz. He's there should be sully shultz
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:25.160]   Well, I think partly the attention is because she's a female commercial airline pilot and only that she was um
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.920]   Very early on as a fighter pilot. Yeah
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.920]   Yeah
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   Nice
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:38.760]   So uh, you want you want sally joe to drive your way. I want sally joe. I truss sally joe over
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.640]   Any darn any mysterious technology
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:51.080]   Uh planes most here drive by wire. They are that's true. Yes. Sorry. I'm like, well actually jaff
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.160]   You're already there. Yeah
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.040]   But they don't leave it on all the time
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:01.960]   Uh, it depends. I mean they leave it on a lot some of them leave it on for landings even now too
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:09.080]   It just depends on whether in other circumstances there are uh, there are rules that you have to do a uh autonomous landing once every
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:15.480]   Month or so, I think uh so so yes, sometimes you almost certainly if you fly a lot jeff
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.880]   You have been through an as I do and I was told by one captain. Yeah, you know how you know you're it's the autonomous landing
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   It's the perfectly smooth one
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.880]   I
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:31.320]   Know I do not mean to be smart our fine commercial pilots
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:38.520]   Who I have huge respect for you know, nobody respects doctors anymore, but a commercial airline pilot tan hut
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.240]   Yep
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.200]   All right, let's take a little break
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:47.480]   And then uh we could talk about the sex compass
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.600]   what
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.920]   For the sponsor will be the one that was exactly the response I was looking for
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:58.120]   What I gotta go back to our rundown. Hold on
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   What?
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:05.560]   What the heck we're talking about word press not the sex compass the word press dot com which is my blogging
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.160]   host
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:15.640]   Uh, I love word press. I see more and more people using word press. I well literally 30 of the entire web uses word press
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:20.360]   I've used word press practically since matt maul and we could wrote it early in the 2000s
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.240]   Uh, but for a long time I was hosting it myself, which was so I don't know why I was doing this
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:30.840]   Because I spent you know, I was always kind of tweaking it and playing with it and the server not the content
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:37.640]   I never put any content on there and and I I was paying more frankly to host my own copy of word press
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.960]   Then they use word press dot com when that light went on
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.200]   And I realized I twigged if you were to the fact that I could save money
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:51.800]   And they'd maintain it. I'd always have the latest version. I'd have all the plugins and I'd have the great support of the word press team
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:58.760]   I I ran to word press dot com and created uh, move my site there leola port dot com
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.640]   Uh make your site
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.400]   Your own
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:08.280]   Because word press dot com gives you the freedom and the flexibility to share your voice your work your
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.120]   Way you don't need to be a coder. You don't need to be a designer
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.120]   All you need to do is is have a something to say have a and want a place on the net
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:22.680]   And by the way, this is your place. This isn't facebook's is not marco zuckerberg's place. It's not twitter's place
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.480]   It's your place every business every human should have their own place on the net
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:34.200]   The place people find when they search for your name. You don't want to let somebody else determine what they find you want to do that
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.160]   Great customer support 24/7 monday through friday and on weekends too
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:48.520]   Wordpress has great ecommerce now. This is nice ranging from a simple buy button to a complete online store and plans start at four dollars a month
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:53.880]   That I was crazy to be doing this. I don't know what I was thinking myself
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:31:00.200]   Actually, I ended up getting the business plan because I get so many fabulous features including great plugins. It's htts
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:06.360]   I get jet pack. I get uh the the amp plug-in so it speeds loading on mobile
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.480]   Really if you look at wordpress, you'll realize
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:18.600]   30 why 30 percent of all the websites in the world want a wordpress and why I run on wordpress.com and steve gibson does and paul tharrat doesn't everybody I know
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.320]   WordPress dot com gets started today with 15 percent off any new plan purchase
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:28.680]   wordpress.com/twig is the website wordpress.com
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:33.000]   slash twig for 15 percent off your brand new website
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:40.040]   I'm really pleased my daughter. I registered when abby was born 26 years ago and henry was born 23 years ago
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.920]   I registered abby la port dot com and henry la port dot com
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.760]   And I got I bought I think about the 20 year graduate, which was expensive
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:51.400]   It's like 200 bucks or something 20 year registration because I figured if they don't want it by the time they're 20
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:57.240]   And they they still you know, but just the other day abby said, okay, I'm ready to set up abby la port dot com. What should I do? I said
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.800]   wordpress.com
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:06.680]   And so stay tuned and I told I told her I think she she realized this if you don't create your own website
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:10.600]   Then when people search for your name, it's whatever other people have posted about you
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   She said I want to put like my my best work there my resume stuff like that. I said absolutely abby
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   That's what everybody once you're 16
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:25.720]   Take control of your online presence by having your own website. You have to I really believe you have to do that
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.320]   Do you think you what are you laughing at?
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:36.520]   Has uh my friend as a graduation present gave me my own domain stay seagum about them.com. That's a great present
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.840]   And you've never used it. Um, no
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:44.680]   That's my I have it. My husband does domains. We have our names my kids. Oh, you have them all
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.160]   Relations. I mean you have them all
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.760]   But don't you agree that you really need to have um
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.600]   You do
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:57.560]   And this is kevin marks has always been saying this too. If you don't own your own name and website
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.000]   It's a big mistake. Honestly, you know, yeah
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.240]   Unless you're like I'd like my sister-in-law just got married and she's now her last name is now taylor
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.960]   And so i'm like, yeah, if we're not getting your don't buy your future wetted name as well
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:15.400]   Oh, that's
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:23.080]   You know in the old days you'd practice your new name and your your notebook writing over and over stacy
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:28.360]   I can't marry you because the domain is an available domain. I know
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.800]   Well, you don't have to take his name. Let's be honest. That's very true. I didn't
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.600]   I'm so dark now. Can I open my light or?
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.960]   Yeah, should I please do I was going to talk about sex compass, but maybe this would be a good time for you to get out of here
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:52.520]   You're ready kambridge analytic. Uh another web another whistleblower has stepped forward and said you know what that wasn't the only
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.400]   kambridge analytic a quiz
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:03.800]   We had lots of quizzes and apps like sex compass was one of them. Did you ever take the sex compass quiz on?
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.000]   Facebook while you were feeding information to kambridge analytic a
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:14.520]   Data was collected says kambridge analytic a with a consent and limited to tens of thousands of facebook users
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:20.120]   Facebook says we have but accept that because of friends of friends 87 million accounts
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.320]   All of the data was
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:31.080]   Came for janelitica. I want to know which of my friends took the sex compass quiz. That's that's what I want to find that out
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.920]   I never got notification that anybody
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.800]   Did you have to go to a page?
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.200]   Well, I thought it was just gonna pop up. I thought so too
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.360]   I'm not on facebook anymore. So I can't do this, but you there's a page
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.320]   What's the page you go to? Facebook
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.040]   Cambridge I have to look it up chatroom. Do you know?
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:35:00.360]   Have I been pwned? No, yeah, have I been pwned how to check with facebook
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:03.800]   Go to a new help page
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.400]   Um on the site
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.720]   Oh, we'll see. I can't go there. How to tell if my info was shared with kambridge analytic a
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.680]   Uh, you must log in first
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:20.680]   But this is but see here's the interesting thing. This is just for that one quiz. This is your digital life
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.120]   But now we know from the second whistleblower there were more
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:31.400]   So, uh, I don't know what this page is jeff, but if you search for kambridge analytic on facebook
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.960]   You should find they're still there
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.800]   No
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:41.080]   There were banned came for janelitica page on facebook. Oh lord. That's just their business page, right?
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.680]   No, but they were blocked
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.080]   We're not there but they were just banned from using the data. They don't necessarily get banned from having a
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.960]   driven campaigns. Let's talk
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:55.800]   Oh, that's nervy as hell
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.800]   No, press is bad press
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.120]   Yeah, it's probably true
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:02.200]   Facebook has thanks to gdp
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.520]   I remember we were there was some thought that they weren't going to give you all the features that
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:12.600]   Europe required but then mark said in that phone call you were listening to jeff that they were and now they have announced
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.400]   uh new privacy controls worldwide based on gdp
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.280]   R
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.600]   I know a lot of people are starting to download their facebook information, which is great
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:28.040]   You can for instance turn off facial recognition now
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.400]   I think that's new
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:38.600]   You can uh, you can manage specially protected data in your profile such as religious and political views
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.880]   You have a lot more control. Yeah, here's the setting for face recognition
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.280]   Do not allow facebook to recognize me in photos or videos
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.280]   Now
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.360]   I imagine that this is where i'm i'm going to have a little disadvantage for not having an account
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:59.640]   I can't check but I would imagine that by default recognition is turned on you'd have to find it and turn it off
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:07.400]   Facebook's also rolling out additional protections for teens
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:14.120]   Uh young people between 13 and 15 and some eu countries need permission from a parent or guardian
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:18.840]   To enable targeted ads or to add information like interested into their profiles
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:24.280]   So facebook said teenagers in this age bracket will see a less personalized version of facebook all
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:28.360]   With limited sharing options until they get parental consent
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.520]   That's good. Yeah
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.880]   So, I mean, I I think
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:40.840]   Having a conversation with people about like how their data might be used
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.120]   I mean we have those conversations with our daughter all the time. You could say really this is a benefit of GDPR
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.760]   I'm mixed feeling many benefits
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.280]   I have mixed feelings about generally about government regulation of of internet
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:56.840]   But this is one where you can say there really are some we're lucky GDPR exists
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:03.560]   Uh, we'd be lucky if our own government would implement something like this. Yeah, at least let's see how it goes
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:09.000]   Uh, there's a new page jeff you could look at called access your information
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.400]   On which you can further evaluate the information you've shared and managed it if you download the blob the 50 megabyte blob
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.920]   There's really no
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.320]   Rimer reason. It's just a bunch of data. Although I've seen people already start to write python scripts to parse it things like that
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.640]   Yeah
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:30.360]   I that's the one thing I regret about getting rid of my facebook account. I would like to see that blob
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.040]   I'd like to know what it knew
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.280]   Is it is it dead? No, no, I deactivated
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.240]   Yes, so it's still alive. I just I decided on the list draconian thing
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.000]   So that for instance, I could turn it on download the blob and turn it off again, which I predict you will do
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:52.360]   Oh jeff basos put out a shareholder letter. Oh, we always enjoy that. That's a great read every should I go ahead Stacy
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:58.840]   Do a dramatic reading? Oh, no, let me I was like, let me skim it and pick the parts that matter keep talking about this
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.160]   He mentioned sex compass because sex compass has not come up so far. No, no
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:09.560]   Amazon studios will stop taking amateur scripts at the end of June. So get those scripts right in
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.000]   No more amateurs
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.320]   Only professionals. I guess they they were doing an open call, right
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.520]   Kinda kinda
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.600]   Yeah, I think it was probably more of a publicity thing. Yeah, yeah
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:29.400]   It's really interesting to watch some of these big big
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.200]   Titles be sold for huge amounts of money. We talked about the lord of the rings
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:38.680]   um the foundation saga apple bot foundation
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:44.040]   Um the peripheral which is one of william giv Williams givson's a great famous science fiction author
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.200]   neuromancer really was the the key cyberpunk
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.600]   novel and uh
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.040]   His stuff is great his most one of his most recent novels is called the peripheral
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.320]   Amazon has acquired rights to that is working on a
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.840]   uh tv series
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:07.560]   It's actually why I didn't realize is that old 2014 i've had it in my audible stack for sometime meaning to read it
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.040]   But you know who they got to produce it
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.520]   the producers of west world
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:19.400]   Jonathan know what we suggest. So that's a good thing
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:24.440]   It has a non-linear timeline
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.440]   Uh people love those on television. Yeah
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.920]   Right west world's non-linear, right?
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:39.080]   The original novel is a complicated story writes the verge about time travel divergent futures religious protest groups and a massive
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.560]   corporation called hefti mart
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:47.880]   It takes place both in an economically barren us town and a post apocalyptic london
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.960]   the former
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:56.360]   Is set in the near future the latter a more distant one and it follows the story follows a one flin fisher
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.080]   A woman who discovers a connection between the two worlds when she's testing a video game
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:04.360]   Sounds perfect
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:13.080]   Jeff Bezos apparently has directed amazon studios to shift its programming toward higher impact series
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.360]   That makes sense because they're doing a lot. You know what one of the best series, uh of the year
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:22.280]   Was it on? I know I can't remember if it was an amazon
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.800]   I want to say babylon berlin. Do you remember if that was oh? Yeah? Yeah, it was that was uh, deflex
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.760]   It was netflix darn it. Yeah, it was really good. Wasn't that good? I'm savoring it still. I haven't finished it
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.480]   Yeah, it's one of those you can because there's a lot going on in it tons. Yeah
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:43.960]   But those those flagship story or lost in space which netflix just released on friday, which what did you think?
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:50.200]   Your mr. tv critic. I only seen the first episode and it went on forever
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:57.880]   It was one of those it was one of the things that really drives me crazy where it's like one bad thing happens after another to children
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.200]   And then I can't take that it's to children
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.720]   It takes them it feels like ours to get this poor girl out of the ice. She's frozen solid in the ice
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:11.480]   And it's just and then oh we could get her out of the oh no. We can't get out of this yet. We got oh now that happened
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:15.080]   Oh, I gotta get okay. Oh, I I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you this
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.800]   It's like a spoil anything in fact if anything it's a preparer. It's a preparer
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.280]   Oh
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:32.040]   Yahoo and aol did you see this now that they're owned by verizon
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:37.400]   The new privacy policy the new oath privacy terms
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.440]   Says they can read everything the right to know
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:48.760]   Did you kill your aol account? Well, I don't have anything of value on it. No, I never had an aol
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.880]   Kill your
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:56.200]   Yeah, well, I killed a long time ago. Yeah, who I still have a flicker account, but I don't use it for email instant messaging
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.920]   Posts I do have photos on there, but I'm yeah primarily not using it anymore
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:08.280]   I can't kill it. You know why I can't because our but I'll have to think about moving at our tech guys radio show uses flicker for
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.000]   A monthly photo assignment. We have a tech guy group on there. We're 14,000 members
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.360]   But I actually talked to chris our photographer about maybe we got maybe we got to move this
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.360]   No, but but you want to see my?
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:26.760]   If you want to see my Japan pictures leo dot camera, I'm not using flicker for
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:32.040]   Main photo sharing anymore. This is smug mug and because I pay them
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:37.240]   I'm pretty sure although stacey has taught me to read the privacy policy
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:42.360]   But I'm pretty sure in fact, I know because I know the macassas would use my data for anything
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:47.160]   So I put this is where you the Japan pictures will go, but it's not a social site
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.000]   so
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.640]   You know you don't get the commenting and stuff
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:55.400]   Is that terrible?
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.360]   Nope, however, if you are posting on yahoo
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:04.520]   You might want to consider that verizon has basically asserted the right to read everything and
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.240]   and uh
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.840]   providing an anonymized and or aggregated now, okay
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.280]   Maybe you can help me with illegal ease here
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.480]   anonymized and or aggregated put reports to other parties other parties
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.760]   They don't even say, you know, they don't even do the things like you know people we work with our partner. No, just other parties
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:33.000]   Whoever we want whatever we want. I say I could say if they said anonymized and aggregated reports, okay, that's fine
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.960]   But what is anonymized or aggregated? Does that mean we'll aggregate them but not anonymize them
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:45.320]   That's bad. That's a good question. That's that's some very loose language. Very loose. Yeah, we're gonna don't worry
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:47.320]   We're just gonna aggregate them all
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.360]   Leave your name address and phone number
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.080]   aggregate them
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.200]   Oath and it's a oh you have company you have lots of company
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.040]   Yeah
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.960]   Oath and its affiliates may share the information where we're to see with verizon
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:09.160]   So if there if there were any incentive to get off the uh who platform that now you're really gone
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:12.200]   And uh, yeah as soon as I logged into flicker. I got that so
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.080]   There's a new scam in town. Well, there's a new name for an old scam in town
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.880]   exit scammers
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:25.720]   And it's uh, of course, it's cryptocurrency of vietnamese cryptocurrency company modern tech
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.920]   launched an initial coin offering an ico for something called pin coin
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.200]   32 000 people gave them 660 million dollars
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:43.080]   The seven vietnamese nationals who started the company have seemed to have disappeared
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.960]   with all the money
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.440]   It's called an exit scam
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:53.080]   You know once a scam has a name he pretty that pretty much indicates it's happening a lot
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:46:00.280]   So, you know what think about it when you buy into these ico's
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:10.200]   Okay, anything else you guys want to talk about or should we wrap this up? We'll wrap this up. See what else was here?
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:16.520]   Jordan peel using a I to make a taco, you know, what else is there to discuss it like?
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.920]   How about Jordan peel you won't believe what obama says in this video
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:26.520]   Bring an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.080]   Even if they would never say those things
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.320]   so
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.800]   For instance, they could have me say things like
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.360]   I don't know
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.440]   kill monger was right
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:39.480]   or
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.400]   Ben karsen is in the sunken place or how about this simply
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.120]   President trump is a total and complete
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:49.000]   Now
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.640]   See I would never say these things. It's obama's face but your drips always
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:56.520]   Someone else would let's like he has the month someone
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.640]   like jordan peel
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.200]   This is a dangerous time
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.480]   Moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. Wow
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:11.640]   That's a time when we need to rely on trusted news sources
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.000]   They sound basic
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000]   But how we move forward
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.880]   and the age of information is
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:25.160]   gonna be the difference between whether we survive or whether we become some kind of
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.000]   dystopia
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.520]   Thank you
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.680]   Stay woke
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.080]   Sorry
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.240]   Stay woke
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:39.240]   Okay
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:44.920]   That's puss feed did that with jordan peel who apparently has a very good obama impression. I did not know that
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.680]   Yeah, he had um, that was one of his things uh key and peel
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.160]   Obama and his
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.040]   Oh, they did the hand shaking one. Yeah, luther and his anger anger. Yeah
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:01.400]   Yeah, I remember that. That's what it was. Yeah. Oh, that was yes. He did a very good obama. I forgot
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.720]   Yeah, yeah
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.200]   Did do you think do you think he got obama's permission?
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:10.200]   You know, I feel like that's the kind of thing obama might have said
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:13.400]   Okay, you may never say that I said you could say that
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:20.600]   But I mean, I feel like you wouldn't make that using him. He's a public figure. You don't you don't you know, but if you're
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:25.080]   I don't know. I'm sure he did because obama was never let never let him
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.960]   Put some of that stuff in there. I don't think
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.720]   White castle, which is my favorite fast food joint forget chipotle
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.760]   Forget talking. Well, yeah, I've live forgot my taco bell that he can't you can't beat the nigga

[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   And now you can get an impossible slider
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:51.960]   This is pretty amazing white castle, which has been selling sliders those little
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.600]   dollar burgers
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.600]   for 97 years
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:02.280]   Is going to start selling them with fake meat inside, but it's not just any fake meat
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:08.680]   It's not tofu burgers or something. This is the impossible burger. We had them and they they're they're indistinguishable
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.960]   I actually didn't taste them. Carson. Did you taste them?
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:17.480]   Our staff that did taste them said they were they you couldn't tell they weren't real hamburger
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.040]   Well, this is a beauty is you can't tell that a white castle is
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.640]   So lighter, you know what's in there. It's mostly bun
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.400]   And
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:31.640]   possible foods which makes the impossible burger has a 70,000 foot production facility in oakland
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:37.720]   And they said we can make more than a million pounds of our plant based burger in a month more than enough
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:43.320]   To supply white castle you can get impossible burgers at upscale restaurants in san francisco, but this is the first fast food
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:49.560]   We can't there's a hop dot is which is a local chain sells them here impossible burgers
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.040]   Uh-huh. Oh, have you tasted it?

[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:12.280]   That is super funny

[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.960]   Quinoa it's a superfood the superfood of the Aztecs
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.920]   I think we should do a show from a taco bell
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:02.520]   Oh my god, I could I could take you on tours of like all kinds of taco places. No, but he doesn't want taco places

[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.080]   El rice taco truck
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:29.160]   Actually, their burritos are even better
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:38.040]   Jeff Jeff ps chops in the chat room says okay jeff wants to fly to texas and eat tacos at a chain franchise
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:41.000]   Just just for the showbiz of it
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:47.160]   Uh, we got a space x falcon going off in about 20 minutes
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.560]   Just a word warning. No, we're not. We're gonna we're gonna wrap it up here
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:59.320]   The 53rd slides gets were one of the space x falcon nine rockets and the eighth space x launch this year
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:06.200]   Uh, you should all watch it, but right now we're gonna close things with jeff javis's number of the week
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:10.600]   So after 11 months kanye west was off twitter
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:16.680]   He he'd force war in twitter. Oh, he didn't go back. Oh, man
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:20.600]   He's using twitter to write a philosophy book. Oh lord
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.760]   Oh to uh
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:28.520]   twitter.com slash kanye west and leo. I think some of these deserve a leo le port treatment
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:32.520]   A dramatic reading sometimes I wonder about kanye
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.680]   Don't trade your authenticity for approval
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:40.600]   I find myself
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:46.520]   Getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:49.320]   This person stole this from me
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:54.600]   And the funny thing is it'll be a reference. I took from somewhere
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:53:00.200]   Carse you what this is. This is like montane montania. How do you say his name?
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.640]   Montane
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:03.640]   montane no, it's not
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.480]   Come on. He lacked himself in a tower and didn't really and wrote all about his own thoughts
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:12.360]   Kanye west
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.080]   Cars have four wheels hoodies have hoods
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:22.200]   It's amusing to me when someone says this is an original hoodie bro. It's a hoodie
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.200]   Trend is always late
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:35.160]   Be here now be in the moment the now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:41.080]   The bad parts the boring parts the parts with a high anxiety embrace every moment for its greatness
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:46.040]   This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:52.280]   Everything you do in life stems from either fear or love
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:57.480]   Oh, by the way, this is my book that i'm writing in real time
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:00.920]   No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:07.160]   This is not a financial opportunity. This is an innate need to be expressive your 280 characters or less
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.440]   pictures of shoes
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.880]   Me and my friend anthony shiller always ask questions about time
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:18.840]   Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:23.560]   Everything means nothing until you make it something you are your validator
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:28.920]   He's got 13.6 million followers. He follows one person
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:35.720]   He's got one like and 41 tweets and there my friends is a picture of kanye's pants
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:41.400]   Stacy higginbotham your
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:45.240]   Up next pick of the week your ting okay
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:52.440]   Sorry, sorry, okay pick of the week is I got the review unit. I haven't put it in yet
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.160]   It could be switch. Oh, that's the new week. Oh, be switch plus
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:01.160]   Yes, it is it is a connected light switch that you put in and you can talk to madam a
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:06.360]   It looks like it has speakers and microphone in it. Is it a madam a device in your wall?
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360]   It is
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:13.880]   But it is not you guys a dimmer and yes, you do need a neutral wire. Uh-huh. Oh
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:17.000]   Oh
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.840]   Those are fat wire clips
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:25.000]   Uh, oh, but this is nice. I like I like the the angularity of it. It's pretty deep. So that's a lot of computing power
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.520]   Back there. It's going to be a pain to stick in a three or four gang switch if that's what you're trying to do
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.640]   Um, and let's see. I'm just looking here

[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:52.360]   He got his first job. There he is at the age of 16
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:58.760]   Uh as a newscaster in a studio that looks a lot like the one I started in he was 84 years old
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.200]   And of course at the end he found a renaissance after he retired from npr's morning edition
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.720]   He found a renaissance as the announcer on weight weight. Don't tell me
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:11.800]   And and because weight weight didn't have any money for prizes
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.440]   The prize was carl castle
