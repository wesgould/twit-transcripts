[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.280]   This week in Google, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, is this a big week?
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400]   Let's bring in the panel and get started.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.320]   To my left, Gina Trapani of smarterware.org
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   and one year older.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680]   Happy birthday, Gina.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.480]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.760]   I'm excited about today's show.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.520]   Lots of goodies.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.000]   Oh, man.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.680]   You know, I was prepared to announce this show
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.440]   as the show for Facebook haters, the Facebook hater hour.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.840]   But now I don't even know if we'll talk about Facebook.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.160]   But let me know.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.920]   I don't even know if that's going to be in the list.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.880]   No, there's so much.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.640]   Jeff Jarvis is also here, journalism professor
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.560]   from the City University of New York.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.360]   An expert on Google, his new book, Public Parts, comes out
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.640]   in just like less than a week.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.800]   I think somebody sent me a copy.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.600]   Yes, I did.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.440]   Oh, oh, oh, get me that book.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.840]   I can actually now hold up a real book instead of the--
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.200]   It's inscribed with cardboard facsimile.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600]   Is it really?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.400]   Of course, it's good.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.840]   Oh, I got to run down to the mailbox today.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.040]   Oh, look, he wrote something in it.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.440]   My handwriting is illegible, so--
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.480]   He wrote everything in it.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.440]   I'm not going to read it out loud.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   He wrote everything in it.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.120]   That's really nice.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.800]   Yes, he did.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.920]   He wrote everything in it.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.080]   Just some of it's in purple pen.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.320]   Some of it's in purple prose.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.440]   So it's perfect.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.760]   Public Parts, how sharing in the digital age
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.880]   improves the way we live and work.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.000]   And it is now-- I think this week, right?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.480]   Tuesday.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.320]   Just coming Tuesday, it's out.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.640]   This coming Tuesday.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.520]   Audible to.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.240]   You and all that.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.320]   And I love it.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.800]   Go ahead.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.000]   On the back, the log rolling is all from people
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.720]   with Twitter handles, including Val Kilmer.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.600]   I know.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.720]   I don't figure.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.040]   That's awesome.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.800]   Spend a quiet day reading, "What Would Google
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.880]   Do" by Jeff Jarvis and watching the Lakers play
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.280]   as if they forgot how to play.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.920]   Jarvis Knows All says Val Kilmer.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   Is it the Val Kilmer?
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.640]   We think so.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.920]   I don't know.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   So you just--
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   That's not the one they account.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.840]   So what do we get?
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.560]   It's also has an outside.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.280]   No, what do we get?
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   This is so great.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.800]   I can't wait.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.640]   The new book is out.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.120]   And I cannot wait to read it.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.040]   Thank you for the book.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.920]   We've got so much today.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.040]   Today, the show is Twig Plus.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   It is Twig Plus.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.360]   It is Twig Plus.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.560]   Speaking of Plus, Mr. Mike Elgin is here.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.680]   He is, of course, a former editor at Computer World,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   but he's now on his own.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.960]   He does a great newsletter.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.400]   And Google Plus has been huge for that newsletter.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.680]   It's become his publishing medium.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.880]   He's one of the few people now who
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.520]   just does it all on Google Plus.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.960]   Mike, good to have you back.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.800]   Glad to be here.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Computerworld.com.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.680]   But plus Mike Elgin is what you really want.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.960]   Oh my god, where to begin?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.640]   Let's start with Eric Schmidt.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.200]   Because he testified before Congress today.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.440]   Google actually released a guide to the Senate Judiciary
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.040]   hearing, which is good because otherwise I
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   wouldn't know what to think.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.160]   But thank you, Google, for telling me what to think.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.840]   I didn't watch it.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   I was busy doing other things, mowing the lawn,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.560]   having breakfast.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   What happened?
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.360]   Gee, did you watch?
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.520]   I was watching the feed from the Sunlight Foundation,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.320]   which is awesome.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.160]   They do incredible work.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.320]   And what's really neat is that they
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.960]   would show the donors to each senator as they spoke.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.240]   So you could see how much they had actually donated,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.320]   which was just incredible.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.280]   But the stream was a little choppy.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.120]   So it would be this key question.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.800]   What do you say to people who say that you're unfairly
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.040]   using your position as this is the most popular search
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.520]   engine to rank your content higher?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.120]   And then the feed would be like buffering, which scared me.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.280]   So I did see quite a bit of it.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.520]   But I wound up actually switching over to CBS News
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.480]   because they were also doing a live stream as well.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.280]   So I caught the end of it.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.960]   This is Barry Schwartz writing in Search Engine,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.880]   land in preparation for the antitrust hearing today.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.680]   Google has released a guide to the Senate Judiciary Hearing
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.200]   web page.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.760]   When you hear Google is a gateway to the web and controls
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.360]   what you see, remember.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.880]   And then when you hear Google favors its own content,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   remember, I won't read what it says to remember.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.040]   But this is like "Man Mad Magazine."
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.400]   Remember you used to do a feature,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   what they're saying, what they're thinking?
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.840]   Google's telling us.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.040]   So what's fascinating about it is essentially
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   they're using the Microsoft argument, which
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.680]   didn't work for Microsoft.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.400]   But the attack is coming in the form of, OK,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   you guys have everybody's attention
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   because you're this big platform that everybody uses.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.880]   And you're abusing that to favor your own stuff.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.960]   In Microsoft case, it was Internet Explorer or the media
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.720]   player.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.480]   And in this case, it's Google's many services.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.960]   And Google's response is exactly like Microsoft's,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.840]   which is that, hey, we're just one step away
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.920]   from completely failing.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.400]   Anyone can replace us.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.320]   We're vulnerable.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.360]   And so the old antitrust arguments
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.960]   don't really apply to us.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.640]   He actually invokes Microsoft in the third sentence
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.320]   of his statement saying 20 years ago,
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.920]   a large technology firm was setting the world on fire.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   Its software was on every computer.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   Its name was synonymous with innovation.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.120]   But that company lost sight of what
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.480]   mattered than Washington stepped in.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.280]   It was hilarious because the name Microsoft was never said.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.240]   But we know, right?
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.720]   He doesn't say--
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.520]   We all know what it was.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.720]   He says, we've absorbed the lessons of that era.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.800]   We get it.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.600]   He says, we get it.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   The lessons of our corporate predecessors first.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   He says, put consumers first, second.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.720]   Focus on loyalty, not lock-in.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.240]   I mean, you kind of like all this stuff.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.600]   Third, be open, not closed.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.720]   Fourth, be transparent.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.640]   Finally, the only constant is change.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:22.120]   Has Google lived up to those five precepts?
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.760]   So here's the problem.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.520]   They're talking about favoring search results.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.640]   And it's kind of like we've had a conversation like this
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.200]   in journalism.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.040]   Is there such thing as unbiased journalism?
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   There isn't.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.080]   And is there such thing as value-free search results?
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.680]   In other words, if you're ranking something
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.000]   and setting priorities and making decisions about what's
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.680]   more important, what's less important,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.360]   set aside for a moment the customization,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.600]   those priorities are based on values.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.840]   And this was really revealed when Bing first came out
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.080]   and started doing this stuff about trying
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.280]   to be more natural-language-y.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.040]   And you search for something like--
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.480]   you search for Home Depot.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.440]   And it will offer alternatives to that,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.040]   which are other mega chains like Home Depot.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.720]   But that's a value judgment, for example.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.040]   What if the alternative to a giant chain
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.280]   is a little mom and pop store?
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.040]   Microsoft's values in Bing, as expressed in Bing,
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.000]   were that the opposite of Home Depot is another mega chain.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.600]   So there's all kinds of subtle stuff.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.440]   There is no such thing as a value-free thing.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.400]   And whose values are there?
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.680]   They're Google's values.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.200]   It's a tough--
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.680]   Right.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.200]   Right.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.320]   I tweeted today that there is no such thing
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.240]   as objective journalism, or there is no such thing
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.120]   as objective algorithms.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   They are the formula of their rules.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.320]   And there are rules.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   And they are proprietary rules.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.360]   And that's that.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.320]   As Schmitt said at one point, ranking--
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.480]   there are winners and losers.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.760]   Welcome to the Dog E. Dog world.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.080]   It was a very strange thing that they wanted
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.400]   to attack Google for putting Google Maps on Google search
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   pages.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.360]   And they wanted to say that was a bad thing.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.240]   But of course it's not.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.880]   Would you say to the New York Times
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.600]   that you can't promote your own food section?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.960]   You have to report--
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.120]   Well, but that's a very different thing.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.360]   The New York Times is a publication, one of many.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.200]   Google is the search engine.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.880]   I think that's very--
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.800]   But it's only 65%.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.080]   And one of us--
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.160]   But I think that everybody realizes Google is it, right?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.200]   I mean, come on.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.680]   It's 65% because 35% of users are too stupid to change
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.640]   the Microsoft default search engine.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   That's all.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.320]   But you hate a winner?
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.840]   I mean, Eric did say that he recognized special responsibility.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.520]   And--
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.440]   Well, he also invoked that famous saying from Calvin
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.360]   Clulidge who said, what's good for business is good for America.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   That was later changed.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.080]   What's good for-- in the '50s, what's good for GM is good for America.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.760]   Essentially, he said, we are good for America.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.880]   Well, he was saying that the internet is good for America.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.400]   And he's making the argument that Google is good for the internet.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.200]   He was saying that users can switch search engines, right?
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   Which is, I think, is a fair point.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.240]   Here, listening to him discuss some of these tenants that he mentioned,
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.680]   he did say that Google could be more transparent about the way
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.200]   that they rank sites.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   Although he did explain that that's kind of the source of Google
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.040]   was innovation and that--
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.360]   That's a secret sauce.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.880]   I understand.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.760]   Yeah, that's the secret sauce.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.200]   But he said they could be a little better.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.400]   He talked about the data liberation front, which made me really happy as a nerd.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.200]   It was like, oh, that's great.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.120]   He said, hey, you know what?
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.800]   We have this mechanism for users to get their data and switch so they can.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.360]   But thinking about this from the perspective of Yelp, saying, hey,
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.760]   you know what?
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.240]   We don't want to be bolstering Google's place pages.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.120]   We want to show up in search results, regular plain vanilla search results.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.880]   But we don't want to be showing up in things like place pages.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.960]   I don't understand why Google doesn't create some sort of mechanisms,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.560]   like a simple robots.txt thing, where Yelp can say, hey, you know what?
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.360]   Show us in search results, but don't include us in place pages.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.880]   I think they should give companies like that, content companies,
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.360]   a little more control about where they show up in different Google products.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   I feel like I'm here.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   I'm not disagreeing.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.120]   Because the real answer is that the users say whether Yelp should show up high or low.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.880]   In a search result, right?
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.080]   In a search result, right.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.880]   Yeah, in search results.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.520]   So it's not-- one of the senators kind of said something about how companies ought
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.960]   to have more certainty about where they appear.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.440]   Well, no, you don't.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.920]   They want more certainty about how many products they sell, too.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.040]   But you don't.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.680]   Well, because--
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.800]   Right, I'm saying, like, being able to opt out completely.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.480]   Like, right now, you can say in your robots.txt, Google do not index my website, right?
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.520]   So you can opt out of regular search results.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.720]   I think that companies-- there needs to be shades of-- companies should be able to say,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.320]   I want to be able to opt out of just Google Places, for example.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.040]   But they did that.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.760]   They did exactly that, right?
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.200]   Yelp said, get us out of-- I mean, in granted, it was after an attempt to buy them, and they
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.320]   refused and all that.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.880]   And I don't know what the rest of the deal was.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.520]   But Yelp did say, take-- this is what Eric said again today.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.680]   Take us off-place pages, and they did.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.560]   Right, right.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.800]   Google made that decision to do that.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.360]   But--
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.800]   But--
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.320]   No, no.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.680]   Google said that Yelp asked to go off.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.520]   That's where Schmidt said it today.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.760]   Right, OK.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.600]   And then we'll remove that.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.080]   I mean, there's one issue, which is that users determine the results in the generic, you
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.360]   know, for everything.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.120]   And then there's the other issue of customization.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.800]   They have these, you know, filter bubble type customization algorithms where people
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.600]   see different things.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.360]   And this is going to come up in a big way as a defense that Google is going to use and
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.160]   say, look, everybody is going to get search results that change depending on what people
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.800]   do and all these-- maybe something signals or whatever it is.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.840]   And, you know, ultimately, that's kind of hard to argue with.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.440]   It has some privacy implications.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   But from a, you know, favoring Google's stuff, if they can demonstrate that individual choices
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.760]   and actions result in everybody having different search results, it's hard to say that Google
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.720]   is always favoring its own stuff.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:01.080]   Well, Leo, I want to go back to this notion of the media comparison, right?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.640]   And in search-- well, first off, let's say there's no law that says that search has to
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.440]   be unbiased or fair, right?
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.600]   What was the original business model for search advertising at Yahoo, which was that
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.320]   you bought search placement?
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.000]   Google's innovation was to say that was wrong and we're going to offer something else.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.560]   But there's nothing to say that Google couldn't sell search placement.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.680]   The only issue is their credibility with the public.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.920]   That's part one.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.720]   Part two, Google has features, right?
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.160]   They have financial stuff and they have maps.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.680]   And in any world where you tell them they can't promote their own features, that just
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.920]   makes no sense to me, right?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:46.040]   That any media company has features that they promote over others.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.920]   In fact, media companies in the old days promoted nothing from anyone else.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.560]   You bought the product and they never mentioned any competitor.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.720]   I think actually Eric's being a little tone deaf.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.760]   He says most of the complaints about it come from--
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   Again.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.240]   Oh, as always.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.440]   He says most of the complaints come from websites that don't like where their site ranks on Google's
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   search results.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.960]   And I admit that's where complaints from whether websites come from.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.680]   I think he's misunderstanding the fear, the Congress, that this committee has and the fear
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.040]   a lot of Americans maybe rightly have that Google is just too powerful.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.680]   What does that mean?
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   Where's the statute that the client--
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.440]   Well, we give them the power.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.760]   I understand that.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:31.400]   Because we use them and Eric's right in nominally that, well, anybody could take over, but in
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.360]   practicality, I don't think that's the case.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.360]   I think--
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360]   But here's the problem.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.200]   It's got to rely on law and principle, right?
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.400]   Just saying that something makes us creeped out because they're too big or too this or
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   too that.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.480]   I think I mentioned last week briefly I'm reading this magnificent book about the great
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.000]   A&P.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.440]   And there used to be in a place like New York, 50 customers to every grocery store.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:57.360]   Some common chains, chains have advantages of bulk buying, chains were able to lower prices.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   Well, it became a political issue and the Robinson-Papman bill came in and didn't outlaw chains but made
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.600]   it incredibly difficult for them to operate, raised prices for consumers.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.160]   And that's what I was hearing today was a little bit of Congress interfering with a company
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160]   that hasn't been shown to do anything wrong.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   But here's the problem.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160]   This isn't the A&P.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.320]   This isn't a different era.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.720]   And unfortunately, there isn't law or precedent because we're in an internet-- by the way,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.880]   I'm somewhat playing the devil's advocate here.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.360]   But I just want to make sure that this point--
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   I see the horns on your head now.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.760]   I want to make sure this gets represented.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.520]   But I do think that we're in a different kind of era where a company-- we've never had
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:42.080]   a position where a company can control so much of commerce, of information simply by
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.840]   the search results that they deliver.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.560]   I mean, it's really stunning the impact Google has.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:56.200]   And we see that when Google added to its recipe search engine a very simple change about--
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.720]   I forgot what it was, but it completely changed.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.920]   Recipe websites were furious because it changed recipe rankings when you did a search result--
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.480]   search for recipes.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.200]   And it just changed everything by billions of clicks.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.720]   And even a little thing that Google does can have such huge impact.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.840]   But the problem is, I don't think-- I think it's your right-- Al Franken doesn't really
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:23.080]   understand nor does Congress nor maybe do any of us what to do about it.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.760]   But I think what we're expressing, though, is a legitimate concern about the amount of
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.160]   power that this corporate entity that really-- let's be honest.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.840]   It doesn't have a fiduciary responsibility, anybody but it stakeholders who demand profit
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.880]   who say make the advertising work.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.800]   They don't have any real responsibility to the American public, do they?
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.760]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.120]   The internet gives somebody that power.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.680]   So the question is, who gets it?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.960]   Who gets the power?
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.840]   The idea that it could be somehow distributed evenly by law or something like that is a
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   bit of a stretch.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.480]   One of the things that is either came up today or is likely to come up soon is if not Google,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.000]   maybe Baidu, maybe--
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.560]   Wouldn't that be terrifying if a Chinese search-- now, we'll talk about the hearings in Congress.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.680]   If a Chinese search engine garnered 65% of the search, I don't know.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.120]   I would like to see 1,000 search engines bloom.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.440]   And I think it's a little disingenuous for Eric to say, well, there's Yelp and Expedia
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   and Amazon.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.720]   I mean, those aren't search engines and they don't have the same kind of cloud.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.680]   And Bing, for-- I mean, Bing is the only competitor.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   What is it?
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   7%.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.840]   Well, he cited Facebook as a very big driver of traffic, sometimes bigger than Google.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.400]   So that was interesting.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.600]   I mean, listen, the person who gets in first and does the best job and has scaled the largest
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.520]   and has the most data and the most experience, like at this point, wins.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   And that's really the case.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.280]   I think a lot of web businesses run such an early stage.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.880]   I mean, the folks who were there first and Google was there first.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.520]   And that's why this is difficult because the American way is--
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   They weren't there first.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.520]   They weren't there first.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.040]   But the American way is you do it better and you win by doing it better and you become a
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.200]   successful company.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   They only have 65%.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.760]   So they're not a traditional monopoly.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.600]   And yet, I think there is absolutely a legitimate cause for concern.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   But are they a man of power?
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   Are they wheeled?
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.240]   Yeah, I think Microsoft case is really, really instrumental here.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.400]   Everybody was afraid that Microsoft would dominate the world with Internet Explorer
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.600]   and Windows Media Player.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.400]   And Microsoft said, no, we could be replaced.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   Somebody could come along with a better browser and everybody--
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   And they weren't.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.880]   History has shown that Microsoft was right.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.400]   And I think it's exactly the same case.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   The most likely thing that's going to happen with Google, everything else being equal--
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.480]   Forget about belief in Google or whatever-- is that they will fade because this is what
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   companies usually do.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.320]   They rise to power and then they fade out.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.960]   Google probably won't because they're really, really good.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.560]   But that's the point.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.280]   They're probably not going to stay on top because they are coasting with their abusing
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.440]   their monopoly or whatever.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.320]   They're probably going to stay on top because they have demonstrated, especially recently,
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.600]   the ability to reinvent themselves.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.440]   And so that's really what it's required.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.240]   It's really, really hard for Google to stay on top.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.280]   It's not something that happens automatically.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.320]   And if they do screw up, they do violate our trust.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.920]   We really can move on mass to being.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   It can happen.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   But Google shows that.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.160]   It takes one second for you to start using an up search engine.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.640]   Here's this little drive you.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.920]   Since you're playing double, this won't let you go on.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.960]   When I asked a question, Schmidt said, and I quote, "I'm not sure Google is a rational
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.920]   company trying to maximize its own profits."
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:36.000]   But as he was arguing that it was also a company that follows the principles you listed.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.160]   And that puts itself up on a pedestal, which I like trying to argue that it has principles,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.800]   but that also sets it up for--
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.320]   Would you say that the Google shareholders have the same point of view?
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.080]   Because really, Google can run itself.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.040]   It can have this fantasy about how it runs itself.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.240]   Google could have--
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.520]   But I'll customize shareholder value.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520]   That's their job.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.320]   But they've not.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   Right?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.400]   Now, you can argue whether this would be the case or not.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.720]   But as Eric said in the past, they pass a billions.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   And I mean billions of dollars that could go if they use the homepage, for example.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   And also what they do is trying to--
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.640]   It's easy to have principles that are successful, though.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   Exactly right, Gina.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   Exactly right.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   Yeah, true.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   I'd like to see when Google has a bad year, how they do.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.240]   Have been a more principled company, do you think, Gina?
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.040]   Could Microsoft have been more principled?
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040]   Hmm.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.680]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.120]   That's hard to say.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.480]   I think that Google started-- I mean, it was-- the very beginning of Google was, you know,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.200]   don't be evil, because there was a sense of what you could do, you know, the power of
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.040]   technology and what you could do to really screw things up.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   And I think that Microsoft was just so early that it just didn't have that and it's DNA
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.600]   and it's culture so early on.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.680]   I think it was-- everything was just so new.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   In both cases, they--
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   It's--
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Go ahead.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.040]   In both cases, they were both run by visionary founders who could overrule everybody and basically
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.120]   make decisions based on their own values.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.360]   And in both cases, they've done that.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   The difference is that Bill Gates had different values than the Google founders who actually
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.000]   have made, as Jeff pointed out, lots of decisions that don't necessarily blind the
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.520]  -- both bolster the bottom line of the company or benefit shareholders.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   Lots of decisions.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   But what they did in China--
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.920]   I mean, if you read-- if you read the-- in the Plex, there are a lot of examples in there
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.680]   where either Sergey or Larry would just overrule something because they don't like it.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.360]   It's a counter to their value.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   So they're optimists.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.200]   However, you can't really-- you know, who knows what's going to happen with the-- eventually,
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.920]   Google will become an increasingly conventional company.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.520]   It has to because it's growing and so on.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.160]   So-- but I think that's really the only difference is the actual values of these founders who
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.520]   can just make-- who can dictate their will were different.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:18.280]   And as Eric said once at Aspen, when asked about-- the classic question is Google too
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   big.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.080]   Brian Lehrer from WNYC and PR station who asked him, he has been-- Google too big question.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.720]   The thing you're asking Leo.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.520]   And his response was, well, who would you rather have run us, us or the government?
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.320]   Right, because that's really the choice.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.880]   What are the choices you got?
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.280]   And so, OK, I'm not going to take off-- I am now going to take off this devil's advocate
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.320]   hat and point out that even if there is something to be said for the fact that we are-- I think
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.240]   legitimately afraid of this power that Google has, there isn't an obvious solution.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.640]   And you just brought that point up.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.840]   Well, what do you do?
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.360]   I mean, I think-- let me propose this.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.960]   Would it be a preferable world if there were five search engines each with 20% market share?
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.720]   Would that be preferable?
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.160]   I think it would be.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.280]   I mean, I don't know how you make that happen.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.880]   But I don't get the question.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.080]   Would it be preferable if I'm forced to drive five different cars?
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.320]   No, you can pick your search engine.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   I can now.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:25.240]   If I don't like Google, I can live happily on Bing.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.720]   Well, why do people pick Google?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.000]   For instance, I just saw a study that took the branding of Bing off and put Google's branding
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.480]   on it and switched them.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.560]   And people preferred the Bing search results if they didn't see the Google-- it was the
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   Google brand.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   It was the brand.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.520]   It could very well be that after 10 years of looking at the Google Doodle, we just liked
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   the brand better.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.480]   It has nothing to do with the product.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.120]   You like it better than Microsoft?
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   Yes.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120]   We do.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   Leo, if your question is, would it be better if there was way better and more competition
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   in the search engine than me?
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   Yes.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120]   Answers absolutely yes.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.120]   Absolutely yes.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   Just as there is in social now.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:11.800]   Well, I think what Eric Schmidt's trying to do, and I think it's somewhat disingenuous
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   is say, well, Facebook and Expedia and Yelp are the competition.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   Maybe they are.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.160]   I mean, we've talked certainly about the fact that social and location-based searches are
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.160]   eating some of those ones.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.480]   The search is not the business anymore.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.320]   Search is the Battle of the Past, right?
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.120]   I argue that Signals is the Battle now, and the Battle is between Facebook and Google
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   there.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   And if you want to get up for Google for monopolistic positioning, I've always said
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.560]   that where it is not search, it's advertising.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.360]   It's market share and advertising online.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.600]   And that's the case where I've long said that Google is in a position to play God and say
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.560]   that, you know, Matt Cuts is God.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.240]   And by the way, God's nice.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.760]   Yeah, we like Matt.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.960]   And that's one of the reasons Google is very smart to push Matt forward.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.720]   To give it a face, right?
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.920]   Right.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.080]   And so if Google thinks your business is bad and they can just cut you off at the knees
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.920]   or above, and that's that.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:20.760]   That's the area where I think Google has a potential to not favor its own stuff necessarily,
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.000]   but to have a power of God that comes from their market share in advertising.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.440]   Did Schmidt talk about Bing?
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.040]   Because I'm looking at the compete results of search market share results from February.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.960]   And Bing powered, if you include Yahoo and other Bing powered sites, was 30% of search.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:48.000]   Google 65, Bing powered 30% and the rest, the long tail, ask AOL stuff like that.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.360]   That 30% is a pretty big number.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.360]   And look how short a time it took to develop that.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360]   So Google's gone down.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Did Eric mention that?
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.960]   Because I think that that might have reissued.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   He didn't mention the word Microsoft at all.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.120]   He didn't know M word past his mouth.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.640]   Does that mean he's really most afraid of them?
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   I don't know.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.320]   I mean, 30% is huge out of nowhere.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   So maybe we don't have to worry about this.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.440]   I certainly don't think a government solution, a government imposed solution is the right
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.520]   way to go either.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   I don't think an antitrust action against Google is the right way.
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.360]   By the way, I don't think there's any guarantee that that's not going to happen.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.520]   Have you been watching now the cross-examination?
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   Is it still going on?
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   Are they done?
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.560]   No, they moved on to Yelp.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.080]   They're talking to Yelp now.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.760]   So what did Al Franken do that everybody's so incensed about?
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.760]   What did he ask?
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.280]   Anybody else?
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.920]   It was, he started off saying, let me say first that I heart Google.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   I love Google.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   Yeah, please.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   And it's a wonderful thing.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.440]   And then he turns around and he was just bumbling.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.200]   There was no focus to what he was saying.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.720]   Basically what he tried to come around to, and I was wrong about this in Twitter, but
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:06.040]   he tried to basically hint at the idea that because Android's so big that, you know, can
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.280]   you, it was exactly a Microsoft argument.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.320]   Can you kill Google places and install Yelp?
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.600]   And Schmidt kind of said, it's the web.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.000]   You can get the either.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.480]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.000]   And so I said that in Twitter and some have said, no, no, no, no, places is a subset of
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.960]   the mapping application.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.920]   And Yelp also does have an application.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.880]   But the truth is you can get to both from this thing called the web.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:40.680]   He was talking about the Google specific apps that come pre-installed with Android, right?
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   At that point.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.320]   So here's a good question from our chatroom.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:52.400]   Web 944 says, as an analogy, what if a corporation controlled the card catalog at a library?
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   Would that be a good thing?
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.240]   Well, the library doesn't matter.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.360]   It probably wouldn't matter because essentially, well, I mean, all things being equal because
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.560]   what Google does, and this is a distinction that may be too subtle for a lot of people
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:14.440]   to notice average users to notice, but compared to say Facebook, Google doesn't filter anything.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   They rank things.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.880]   And that's an important and powerful capability.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.440]   But in the case of say, Facebook's edge rank, they're actually filtering things.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.440]   Big time.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.760]   So they're preventing you from seeing things anywhere.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   Right.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.480]   So it isn't moving something to the second page.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.640]   Isn't ranking something lower in effect is de facto filtering.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   I mean, if something is hard--
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   But who did that?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   We did that.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   But it is.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   But getting back to the--
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.600]   Well, the card catalog would also have everything.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.840]   And in a library, I don't think in this there's some way to rank.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.560]   I mean, everything's ranked alphabetically.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   I don't know.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   I think--
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   OK.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.560]   Speicious argument then.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.560]   We'll throw it out.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.560]   I don't know.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   But you didn't even argue.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   I mean, the reality is, is that it's not-- I mean, it's not our--
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.080]   It's human nature to just look at the first page of search results.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.680]   I mean, everything's advertising the card catalog by letter.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.840]   But I think the filtering distinction is a really good one.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.600]   But I don't think you can say, well, users are just too lazy to go to page two to find
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.920]   the thing that's on page two.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   And that's crazy.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   I realize that we didn't--
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   How many times do we dig--
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.760]   How many times do you dig to page two on the search results?
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   Never.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   Very rarely.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   Never.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.760]   And I think--
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.920]   Only if the first page doesn't give you anything at all that you're looking for.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   Well, right.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.520]   I mean, everyone sitting here at this table are really good at searching Google.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.600]   We understand and/or's and different kind of filtering mechanisms.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.200]   But yeah, you never go.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.720]   You never go to page two.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.280]   If you know what you're looking for, you'll go through multiple pages.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:46.760]   If I'm looking to find out where an old colleague of mine works and I don't find them on the
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.560]   first page, then I'll keep going second, third, fourth page.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.400]   But if it's something like, I want to just find out what happened to the Schmidt hearing
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   today.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.000]   First link, second link, and I'm done.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Well, you also--
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   I'm not going to run there.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.880]   You may decide you want the Washington Post version or the Tech Crunch version to open
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   the--
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.920]   But that's the point, which is that Google's algorithms determine really what you're
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.240]   going to read.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.040]   And Jeff, you said, well, no, we did it.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.120]   Well, yes and no.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.560]   I mean, if Google's algorithms were absolute-- I mean, absolutely--
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.640]   But that you're going to say fair or unbiased or equal and there's no such thing, right?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.480]   There are winners and losers and the big get bigger.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.480]   That's true.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.960]   The chat room reminds me, too, if you want to know the most biased algorithm, you're
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   going to imagine.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.160]   It comes from a library, the Dewey Decimal System.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   David Weinberger--
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160]   Totally biased.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   I agree.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   Wonderful book called Everything is Miscellaneous.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:40.240]   And I'll get the numbers wrong here, but just by scale that there are 25 numbers for
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.400]   Christianity and two for Judaism and one for everything else.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   And Mr. Dewey's--
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   He was a little biased.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.840]   A little biased, yeah.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   Exactly.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   And that is inevitable.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.800]   That is absolutely inevitable when you make those decisions.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   So there is bias.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.200]   The key for Google, I think, and the biased question is, if the algorithm doesn't change,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:07.440]   right, if it at least treats things equally in the sense of not being worse to this one
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.200]   entity, then you can dislike the algorithm and say it gives you bad results.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.680]   But the reason Google works and the reason the big grow bigger is because you like the
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   results.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   And it is our--
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.840]   Let's assume that-- is it safe to just assume that Google-- certainly Google massages
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.800]   are results.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.320]   They want to have the results that are going to drive the most traffic.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.920]   They're going to make you happiest.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.040]   That's their goal.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.680]   And so presumably they're operating as a business.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.240]   It's in their interest to keep you coming back to Google.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.480]   So they want this-- and they tweak their algorithm in such a way that the search results, the
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.000]   stuff that's at the top of the page is the stuff that will make you come back.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Safe assumption.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Right.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.400]   And the paid placements, right?
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   And the ads, I mean, which are marked.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   But add words.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.080]   Do you think they even let that influence search results?
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   Probably not.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.080]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.920]   But I'm saying just that the items that show up on the page, the yellow paid placement,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   that's--
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   Right.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   But I'm going to put those aside and just say just search results because this is really
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.200]   what the issue is, the filter bubble issue in general and the issue of Google's power
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.800]   is in general is, look, there has to be some algorithm.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.680]   There has to be some decisive algorithm.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.200]   What is the bias?
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.760]   And is the bias merely to give you the result you will be happiest about getting and come
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   back for more?
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.800]   And I would say, if they're doing their job right, yes, that's what the bias is.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   There's a problem.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.360]   There's a fine ointment, which is this.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   As we all know, whenever you use one platform company services, it's a lot easier to use
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.360]   the other ones.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.560]   So in my case, I gave up everything for my Google+ diet.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.760]   I'm using Google+ for everything.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.160]   And suddenly, my Chromebook seems a lot more useful.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.680]   And suddenly, Gmail seems a lot more.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.080]   And so if Google's searches, let's say I'm not claiming that this is the case, but let's
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.760]   say Google's search results did favor Google features.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.320]   And you did sign up for those features and start using those features.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.080]   And then those features start favoring Google search.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   It goes back.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   So it's a kind of a self-- it could be, theoretically, a self-reinforcing phenomenon
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   that would be unfair.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.840]   That's a good point.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.440]   And that's why Monopoly is a problem because Monopoly drives you to stay within the Monopoly.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   It's self-perpetuating.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.200]   But that's a difficult problem because ultimately, it's about user choice.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   So is the ranking issue, too.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.280]   If users pick the first thing or they say, I'm feeling lucky or whatever, that's a choice.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.080]   That's a user choice.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.400]   And using other services as a choice and doing your--
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.120]   Yeah, but there was Microsoft's defense was, well, there's other offices.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.280]   There's Apple.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   There's other operating.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   That was their defense.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.280]   There's other browsers.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.520]   There's always choice, even if there's a Monopoly, as long as there's even one little tiny other
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.880]   person, as long as there's not a 100% Monopoly, there's always choice.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.240]   That does not protect you.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.960]   And Microsoft was right.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.640]   They were right as it turned down.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.840]   But that's always the defense of a Monopoly is, well, wait a minute.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.800]   You don't have to buy your oil from standard oil.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.120]   There's other oil companies out there.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.360]   It's not in and of itself a defense against antitrust action.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   But look at how--
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   Where's the line?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   Where's the line?
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   What's the principle?
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.600]   What's the remedy?
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   Right?
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.960]   Otherwise, you risk doing what I hate in the privacy discussion of just saying, oh, it's
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.200]   creepy, without defining what the principle is.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.240]   What's the violation and what's the remedy?
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   So is Google violating-- is there just being big is not and should not be illegal in this
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.280]   capitalistic nation?
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.320]   Being successful is OK.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.560]   If we make being successful wrong, whether it's A&P or Google, we're going to be in a
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.560]   mess.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.000]   And the reason there's antitrust law is it's not the fact that you're successful.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.720]   It's the fact that you use, just as Mike was talking about, your success to predispose
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.560]   people to continuing your mental--
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.040]   No, that alone isn't the violation.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.760]   If you use it to smash down competitors.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.880]   So show me-- and I know I'm sounding like a Google fanboy today, but it's my turn.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.360]   Show me the smoking gun of what you think Google has done to be unfair.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.120]   The one-- the one I mentioned is when Google unfairly does kill a company that isn't a
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.720]   spam company and uses his power of God to do that.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   And I will start with there.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:27.560]   But I have real trouble saying where Google has unfairly and wrongly used its power to
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.120]   kill a worthy competition.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.560]   Is it not the ultimate intent of antitrust law or any anti-monopoly law, just to keep
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.320]   it at a level playing field?
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.680]   As Eric Schmidt said today, the internet is level playing field.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.240]   And I think we accept that.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.480]   And if we do, then we have to say case closed.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.480]   Well, I'm outside.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   Kind of.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.720]   I mean, there are two issues here.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.880]   One is, I think, Facebook is the best evidence for Google's argument because Facebook came
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.480]   from nowhere and now they kind of control a huge amount of traffic and links.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:10.960]   And just in the last two years, if Google was the all-powerful monopoly that was squelching
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.400]   all the competition, this Facebook thing would not have become what it has become.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.760]   The second problem is this whole algorithm thing, I don't even think there's a single
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:27.560]   Google engineer who fully understands the Google algorithms, let alone Congress.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.000]   Al Franken doesn't have a prayer of real estate and it gets way too complicated.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And in fact, for this to continue and for there to actually be prosecution, they have
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.720]   to demonstrate something even at an even higher level.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.760]   They have to just demonstrate a conspiracy, an attempt at restraining trade.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.000]   They have to find smoking gun that says, well, Google conspired to keep Facebook out of the
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   search business.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.200]   But Leo actually, yeah, I wish that were the case.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.680]   They don't have to do that?
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:01.720]   No, not to hurt Google, not to have an impact, not to change the course of things and make
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.440]   them and put a chill on them.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.720]   And there may be an all online a business they should go into that they don't just because
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.840]   they fear they're going to get stopped because Congress doesn't like them.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.360]   So no, it's not just about the law.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.040]   I came up with an activist A&P thing, but it became a highly political issue to say that
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.800]   small groceries are good, big groceries are bad, even though big groceries save people
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.200]   money.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.440]   And I heard similar rhetoric today, what about the small businesses and small businesses?
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.440]   And Eric said, we're good for small businesses.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.160]   We point we can get to more people as long as the small businesses in the search business.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:42.400]   Well, you know, Google has done the work of scaling to incredible dimensions, right?
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.320]   And now more companies have that, you know, have the prices and the ability to scale a
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.120]   lot further a lot faster.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.640]   But this is kind of what I was saying earlier when I said first, which is incorrect.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.600]   Of course, Google wasn't first, but they've been in this business for so long.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.240]   They've been indexing the public web for so long.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.040]   They have so much data and so much knowledge and scale and technology like they've been
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   in it the longest.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.840]   So they have that advantage.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.440]   And yeah, I mean, I think that Facebook is a good example of a company that could come
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:13.280]   in and be really successful and drive more traffic than Google, but Facebook is a different
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.280]   innovation than Google.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.560]   Facebook is not a search engine, right?
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.840]   And that's that's Leo's point.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.880]   Like Facebook innovated in social and Google innovated in search.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.960]   And so that there is a big difference there.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.760]   Search is not the world anymore, right?
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.800]   The amount of traffic that goes to sites now through social means through links proportionally
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.360]   in market share, you know, forget about about Google for a second and just talk about search
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.840]   versus other means of discovery.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:44.000]   And now again, we humans and our links in Twitter and Google+, and Facebook are becoming
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.640]   a force that will rival Google, I believe will rival search.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.440]   Somebody just pointed out in the chatroom, this is a good point.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.560]   If you search Google for Bing, the search, the first result is Bing, Microsoft Bing as
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.560]   it should be.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.280]   Yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.560]   I mean, the fact is that Google doesn't want other companies to stop making great content.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.720]   Google provides great service and makes a ton of money because there are tons of websites
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.520]   out there that make great content that they can serve up in their search results.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.920]   You know, shutting out other companies is not in their best interest.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.120]   I mean, the reality is that Google isn't going to create all the content, you know, all
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.600]   the great content on the web.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.920]   I think that whole page of Bing search results is Bing, except for one thing, which is a
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Matt Cutts article about Bing.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.720]   But in every other respect, everything here is it's about Bing.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.680]   All right, I think the problem that's coming, if I may just quickly, search is becoming,
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.280]   right now we think of searches, you go to Google.com or Bing.com and you type in a search query.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.560]   But search is going to be, as Eric Schmidt has pointed out, is going to become a virtual
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.360]   assistant on your phone where you'll be walking down the street and your phone will beep and
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.560]   it'll say, "Hey, they're having a sale at this store."
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.080]   Or, you know, your friend is 300 yards away, would you like to meet at this restaurant?
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.960]   You both like Italian food.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.040]   It's going to become, to the point where when people use it as a virtual assistant, it'll
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:11.000]   be the equivalent of everybody using the, "I'm feeling lucky," link.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.240]   And then it becomes problematic because at that point, Google is just choosing things
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.400]   for you.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   And then what?
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.040]   Okay, that's the filter bubble argument, right?
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.520]   That's Eli Parris' argument to some extent.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:33.240]   So you go into, what's your big grocery store around there?
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   Safeway.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   Safeway.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.240]   Go on, go on.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   Oh, of course.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   Hope food.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   Excuse me.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   You hippie.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   So that's actually a good example.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.720]   So Whole Foods buy its brand and everything you think they're going to pick the stuff that's
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.280]   good for you, right?
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.080]   That's just, that's the impression you get.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:54.880]   And you go walk into the catch-up aisle and why is Heinz in a better position than Delmighty?
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.380]   Why is Delmighty hidden?
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.760]   Why are they pushing Heinz?
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.800]   Because they make more money on Heinz.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.560]   Well, because probably because Heinz pays them.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.600]   And Heinz pays them for doing this is the way that industry works, right?
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.960]   And that does not happen in search anymore.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.960]   You stood.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   Precisely.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.240]   So what I'm saying is that there is more of an economic filtering going on.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240]   That's true.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.240]   In the rest of life.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   In your grocery store.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.240]   In search.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   Or even in that case.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   So now back to your point.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.840]   So you, and this was part of the point I think that was fair about a 10-listing search
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   page versus a Google map.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.080]   And Eric said, well, 10-listing search page doesn't work very well when you're a phone.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.080]   You're on a phone.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.080]   You want to wear them on mine now.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   What's around me?
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   And you want to navigate that.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.880]   The better and better and better that gets, the more it knows you, the more signals you
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.920]   give, the more indeed will give you something for you.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.520]   But here's the thing.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.160]   It's doing it because it thinks it will please you as Leo said before.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.480]   If it doesn't tease you, it fails.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.720]   So there's still a test there.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.640]   Now if you're ignorant to what else you could have had because there was a business deal,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   yeah, it's a problem.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.440]   But that's not the way Google business operates, right?
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.800]   The ads are there by an auction.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.680]   And so the architecture of it solves a lot of the problems.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.560]   The problem here is the Senate doesn't understand this architecture to save their lives.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   All right.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.000]   I'm going to table this argument.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.400]   It's a really good discussion.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   I'm really glad Jeff that you were there to defend Google.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.120]   And I think we attacked and attacked and attacked and you held strong and you held firm.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:28.040]   And I think this is what I would propose as our conclusion from the panel is, can we just
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.120]   get Congress to wait and see if Congress had maybe awaited a little longer on Microsoft,
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.840]   they would have saw, hey, it's not a problem.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   Let's wait and see.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.480]   There's no smoking gun yet.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   Mike, you're shaking your head.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   You think we can't wait?
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.720]   No, it's all about election year posturing has nothing to do with reality.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.480]   They're all just pandering it when that happens.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.160]   There's nobody's going to get nobody is going to get one vote by attacking Google.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   I don't think that that's the right way to go.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.320]   Who's going to get a vote?
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.720]   I think I think we hear that.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.520]   You might get a vote in Redmond.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   That's it.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.600]   The old I think you live now in the evil part of America.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.040]   I live in what used to be the evil part of America.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   What?
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.280]   Think East Coast liberals and all that, right?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.640]   Now it's these scary geeks in tech land.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.520]   We're taking over our lives and somebody has to watch out for us.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.000]   That's what the whole privacy debate is about.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.480]   I know that's not a book plug, it's just a point.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.040]   And that's what this is going to be about, I think.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.720]   One last point, if I may, I think the miracle today that I think Eric Schmidt got through
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.000]   the whole thing without any Schmidtism.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.640]   We're not sure yet, but we haven't found any Schmidtisms.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   Thank God.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.880]   Do you think that they were sitting there in Mountain View, Marissa Meyer, Larry and
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.320]   Sergey holding hands going, please, Eric, please, Eric, please, Eric, please, Eric.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.400]   They have a kill button probably.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.360]   Dave from it is right behind him.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.080]   You could just see him, his eyes going up, looking nervously.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   It was hilarious to see that.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.640]   There's somebody, there's some other fact, total on the other side, who's just nodding
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   his head.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.880]   It says, that's the German guy.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.560]   Christina Warren in Mashable, 10 quotes from the Google Senate hearing, not one bad.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.720]   We regret what happened.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   That was a mistake.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.280]   That was on the pharmacy, the Canadian pharmacy search results.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.000]   Representative Klobuchar, Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota, I recently Googled myself on Google.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.720]   She also said, Google is an important part of the Internet.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.720]   Thanks for the news, Frank.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.820]   Thank you, Amy.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.960]   We have to represent the web, how it is and not how we wish it to be.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   I like that.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.640]   That's why pirated content shows up in search results.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.080]   Al Franken, I live Googled.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.880]   Al Franken, if you don't know, who does?
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.480]   This is about the search algorithm.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   Eric Schmidt on Yelp.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.120]   And ultimately, we bought a company called Zagat to do something similar.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.840]   I'm not sure why that's a good quote.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.240]   Mike Lee, some of my fears have been confirmed by our conversation.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.680]   He was such a bozo.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.280]   And I would say again, who gets a vote by attacking Google?
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   Nobody.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.960]   It's like attacking American flagger, apple pie.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.600]   There's nobody going to get a vote out of anybody for attacking Google.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:06.480]   I think that antitrust, even when the attorneys general go after it, if you look at the Microsoft
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   case, that was pure grandstanding.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.920]   All of those attorneys general had a political last year.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   You're right.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   The states did.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.880]   And Google is a big giant company with a lot of visibility and people are unemployed and
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   stuff like that.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.640]   It's a down time.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.920]   I can see how the evidence of bits are trying to make some hay on this.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.520]   Fortunately, he's busy as CNN.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   So, yeah.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   So, I don't know.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.120]   Richard Blumensaw, Democrat of Connecticut, comparing Google to a horse race.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.680]   You run the race track.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.320]   You own the race track.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.720]   You didn't have horses for a while, but now you do and your horses seem to be winning.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.320]   Al Franken then says Google might be doping.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.120]   Google might be doping the horses.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:48.520]   And you don't want to end scene curtain and so much for Congress.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.640]   You know, kind of like a Sousslevester running for Congress on a no artist platform.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.160]   I think that's right.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   We're going to God.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   There we go.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   Drinking game.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.480]   The big risk here is losing votes, not gaining votes.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:05.280]   There is no, I would hope that the Senate would get a clue and realize that the only
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.720]   risk here is just losing votes.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:14.960]   I don't think, I don't think, you cannot make hay here by raising the creepy bar.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.880]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.720]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.800]   That's just a little teeny, weeny bit.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.520]   The thin layer of ice on top of first six hour twig.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.520]   I know.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   Facebook.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.920]   My God, what's going over there?
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.080]   Google plus.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.840]   My God, what's going over there?
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.400]   The social networks, they're going crazy.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.200]   And even that's not all of it.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.520]   There's new Android phones.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.880]   I brought all these phones.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.280]   We're not even going to get to them.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.960]   Come on.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:49.440]   Can you just spread the news out as a thin layer of peanut butter throughout the year?
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.920]   I thought Google Wallet was going to be our top story.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.920]   Geez.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   Who cares?
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.520]   Two cities, one phone, one carrier, Google Wallet.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.440]   It's all relative, I guess.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.440]   It's all relative.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.040]   Netflix, as you know, is one of our sponsors.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.160]   They're also a news story.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.360]   I'm going to save some time by taking the news and putting it in the ad.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.800]   Perfect multitasking.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   Multitasking.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.920]   So as you know, I got the email.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.520]   We all got the email from Reed Hastings saying, what do you say?
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.400]   I love it when a CEO sends me an email saying I made a big mistake.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.840]   It was great.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.640]   He said I blew it.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.360]   The pro pricing thing.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.880]   We're going to divide Netflix into two pieces.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.800]   One piece will be the DVDs by mail.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   The other would be the streaming.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.720]   And I don't know about you, but that's all we've been talking about for the last six months.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.680]   Because to me, the streaming is the great deal.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.920]   Now, I know a lot of people say, well, you can't get everything on streaming, but that's
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.520]   to me, this is fine.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:53.240]   Tens of thousands of movies, $7.99 a month.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:58.280]   Every night I go home and I watch some great movie or TV show on Netflix streaming.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.640]   So I think they made the right decision.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.480]   This is where the future is.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:09.080]   But if you've got a Roku box, a PlayStation 3, an iPad, an iPhone, any Android phone now,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.720]   most of the Android, I think all the Android tablets, you can watch Netflix for the kids.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:19.440]   Give them a tablet and some kids movies and they're good to go.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.440]   It's just fantastic.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.360]   I am a big fan, $7.99.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.680]   You all don't give the kids the kids stays in the picture.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.920]   That's not a kids movie.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.240]   This is the story.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.480]   Oh, I started it.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.240]   Let's not watch that movie.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.080]   Oh, I love this movie.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:41.240]   It's Robert Evans, the Hollywood mogul, sex scandal and movies.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.640]   It's a really good documentary if you get a chance to see that.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.000]   But $7.99, this is what you need to remember.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.360]   These are your takeaways.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.600]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:54.320]   If you're already a member, throw open the window and I want you to yell as loud as you
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   can.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   It's free.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.960]   And just that's all you need to do.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   And that's it.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.320]   So we got a couple of birds killed with that one stone.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.040]   Google Plus, Mike Elgin, you're still a big Google Plus fanatics and big features added
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.320]   including I was stunned at the top.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   Search Google Plus.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.520]   Finally, Google had search.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.520]   What do you think of the search, Mike?
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.520]   Is it work for you?
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.720]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.160]   It turns Google Plus into a real, it's like Pinocchio.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.480]   It's like a real thing now.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   Because now you can--
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.880]   I'm a real boy.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.880]   Yes.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Yes.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.200]   And you can-- people are already doing all kinds of stuff.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.160]   They're saving searches and it's great for discovering new people to follow.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.200]   I think it was funny because a couple of days ago, the big story about Google Plus
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.320]   was that it was a ghost town.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.800]   Nothing was happening.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.520]   And all this stuff hit and suddenly, I mean, the activity level is just through the roof.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.360]   And a lot of it is search.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.680]   There's a lot of circling going on out there.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.000]   And I think a lot of it has to do with search.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.520]   But it's fantastic.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   We all know it would happen.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   So it's not surprising.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   But here, we went from having no search at all to having, I think, significantly better
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   search than Facebook.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.880]   I've always been frustrated by Facebook's search.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.440]   Look at what you can do now.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.880]   So I typed in Eric Schmidt testimony.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.240]   You can save it and now it becomes part of your sparks.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.960]   I don't know if they even still call those sparks, but those are the saved searches here.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.640]   That now explains why this was a good idea.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.480]   And then look, you can do everything people, Google Plus, Post or Sparks.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:36.440]   You can do best of or most recent, which is very Facebook reminiscent.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.200]   This is fantastic.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.960]   This is really important.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.720]   I had lunch and so happens with Bradley Horowitz.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.640]   This was right before it launched.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.520]   He went off to the men's room and he came back and he said, "We just launched."
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   Did he launch from the men's room?
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.400]   I think he pushed the button.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   He pushed the wrong button.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   He thought it was the...
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.600]   He thought it was flush.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.560]   It was lunch.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:08.840]   And so I think that kind of gathering around a topic in a social atmosphere comes really
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.320]   important and really powerful.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.760]   And then the notion that you're by saving it there, you're now following it.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.680]   I love that stuff.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.240]   Sorry, I didn't mean to...
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   No, go ahead.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.680]   I love that stuff because it shows you stuff that your friends said about mad men or true
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.280]   blood or whatever you're searching for, which is really cool.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.720]   That's definitely my favorite.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.680]   So the best of is how does it judge by the number of pluses?
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.080]   It's people that you're friends with or people that are in your circles and I think
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.720]   they probably use number of plus ones or comments and things.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.480]   But it's a good, really good results.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.160]   Is it illegal use of Google's power to manipulate your brain?
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   That's what it is.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.560]   Well, see, and this is the disconnect because we love this.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.480]   Google wants to give us something we love.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.600]   And yes, absolutely.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.440]   By doing so, they build market share.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.200]   So there's a problem right there.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.440]   Save us, Al Franken.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   Save us.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   Yeah, this is exciting.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   So that's feature one.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.440]   They've added search.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.520]   They've also redone Hangouts.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.240]   In fact, one of the features that's great about the new Hangouts is you can broadcast
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.240]   them.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   So Hangouts have been limited to nine people.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.040]   But now when you do a Hangout, you can also tell people they can watch it as many people.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.880]   Is there a limit on the number of people who can watch a Hangout?
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   I don't think so.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   150,000.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Well, okay.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:31.120]   And it occurred to me that if Leo, if I had, now that I have this, all I need is your talent,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.560]   your experience, your staff, your studio.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.520]   And I could give you a run for your money.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.280]   No, but as a broadcaster.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.280]   Absolutely.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:43.640]   This is a very interesting, in fact, I want to use this somehow because I think this is
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   a very interesting opportunity.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.000]   Why don't we do the show on it next week?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.240]   I think we should.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.560]   And I've been wanting to talk to you guys before I decided to do that.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:56.640]   And so what we would do is we would have, we create a Hangout with us and we maybe even
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.880]   could bring other people into that Hangout.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.080]   And then people could also watch it live streaming.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.760]   I mean, yeah, let's do it.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   Pretty amazing.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.120]   I asked Bradley, could we do a quick on this?
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.480]   He said, yep.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.720]   Wow.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.840]   I mean, what is the advantage?
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.720]   This is streaming it on this instead of, you know, you streamers.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.720]   Here's the funny thing.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   Depends on who's talking.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.280]   So Eileen doesn't have to switch.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.680]   You lose the switching power.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   Sorry, Eileen.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.280]   No, actually, I think we believe it or not, I think what we would do is we would feed
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.880]   the video not from a camera on a laptop.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:30.240]   We'd feed the video from our own video stream that we are switching.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.160]   Well, you know, I've done a couple of broadcast Hangouts.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:40.320]   This is before they announced this feature through YouTube and Michael Mozart.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.920]   And it's really kind of an interesting thing.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   It's not elegant and professional like this show is, but it's, you know, because of you
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.080]   don't control it and sometimes it gets stuck on a person or whatever.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.160]   But it's really going to be great because what you can do is the second this thing starts,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.200]   you get a link and now you can take that link and it's sweet.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   When we did it, it's spread throughout Google plus like a virus and we got lots of.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.560]   I think what we will do is we will switch it.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:12.160]   We will lock it on our feet and we will switch it so that you will get the main feed will
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.760]   be switched exactly as professionally as we switch now, but then we will have nine viewers
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.000]   in there that we can then switch to to get their commentary or maybe additional people
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.160]   in there that we switch.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.160]   That's the idea.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.680]   Like I think you have a Greek chorus, a Greek chorus, right?
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.120]   And long many years ago, I tried to get TV people interested in the idea of having a
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:37.320]   TV show, which was a wall of monitors with people on them out there with webcamps, right?
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.680]   And you know, before Twitter having that's this saying, you want to hangouts.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.880]   So and then you have the master, which is you standing at the wall, you know, saying,
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   now we're going to hear from Gina, now we're going to hear from so and so and so and so
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.920]   and you keep a conversation going.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.800]   And it's like the unconference of the virtual unconference, right?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:00.320]   It's I think I think that's where plus could be really interesting.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.960]   You could have we have the back channel now in chat.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.240]   It's hard to imagine a video with audio back channel because no one will listen to us
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   anymore.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:19.600]   But you could have somebody to have a good opinion and base and audience member in chat
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.760]   could say everybody could say, Hey, let I'm just picking somebody at random here Patterson
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.600]   in Patterson saying great stuff in the thing.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.640]   Okay, Patterson, get on and you can come in.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.920]   You know what I love about it purely from a purely selfish point of view.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.680]   One of the great risks of this business that I created called Twit is that we rely on the
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.200]   kindness of strangers of these streaming operators to give us free bandwidth for the
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.840]   video streams.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.400]   And that's Justin TV, you stream bit gravity.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.880]   We try to get on YouTube live.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.600]   They said no, but well, it's complicated.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.400]   They don't want to and we couldn't have any ads.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.840]   Oh, so they said, yes, you could do it, but but you can't make any money at it or something.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.840]   I don't understand it.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.400]   Anyway, Congress, I think that's for straight and trade.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   Sorry.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.120]   Actually, you know, it is actually.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.800]   Hey, Eileen, could you call Senator Franken and let's talk?
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   Sure.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:12.960]   I'll get out of here.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.800]   But if they all pulled the plug, I could use this.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.320]   And we could stream and we could be exactly the same.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.880]   I want to try to make sure.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:26.000]   Well, this allow ads is this is this, you know, like you can't have a business site.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.240]   Are they going to try to come in and say, Oh, we think we just saw an ad.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Would you ask Bradley?
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.480]   Can I put an ad in there?
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.360]   The reason the YouTube live doesn't want ads is because they want to monetize with
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   their own ads.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   They don't want your ads in there.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   They want other people.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   They're not going to monetize hangouts.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.360]   I don't think.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.360]   But like, we're wrong.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.360]   If you said become big, like you're right.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.200]   If you could do a whole show here, if you could do your own mini Leo.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.640]   Well, anybody can.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:48.360]   And that's really, to me, frankly, it's not about me.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.680]   It's about you, Mike and anybody else who wants to do this, and actually I'm terrified
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.880]   because Frank, it gives everybody the opportunity to basically be a broadcaster, have a broadcast
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   network.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:01.600]   By the way, there is a new extras feature that you have to turn on by clicking that gives
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:07.800]   you named hangouts, shared notes and sketchpad, Google Docs integration, and screen sharing.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:13.120]   This goes right against Cisco and Citrix and all the other folks who are doing online
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   meetings.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   This is really cool.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:20.760]   As someone who works at home and often has to use corporate tele-comparting software,
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.360]   I'm very, very excited about this.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:26.880]   I'm excited about this also from just an educational perspective to be able to do.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:32.800]   I interact with my developers, I do a code review, and have to kind of do demos and show
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.880]   off how to do this, that other thing, and screen sharing and Google Docs integration.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:45.360]   I mean, this is really like what Wave's vision, but actually groccable with very clear use.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.560]   Can you do Wave style stuff in here?
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.000]   I mean, it seems like some of the Wave, I saw some of the Wave Wave.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:59.800]   Well, when you combine the chat of the Hangout and Google Docs live editing, then basically,
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.640]   yeah, you've got Wave.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.520]   But what's cool about Hangouts is that you've got all these different experiences that you
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.720]   can have in real time.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   And that was Wave's vision.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.880]   Wave had these gadgets and you could have polls and games.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.280]   But I feel like Hangouts and Plus has just framed it in a way that's really understandable.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.360]   And I said, "Hey, look, you can watch YouTube videos together.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   Okay, you got that.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   All right, cool."
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.760]   So you can edit Docs together.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   You can share screens.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.760]   You can do it all together.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.760]   You can game together.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.800]   And now they open up the Hangouts API so that-- and actually, they call them gadgets.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:32.400]   If you make an app that you can load inside a Hangout, it's called a gadget which made
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:38.080]   me think of Wave and lets you generate a shared state in your app so that people in
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:43.400]   the Hangout can interact with that with your app and that it's broadcast in the same state
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.400]   to everyone.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.840]   So I haven't had a chance to play with the Hangouts API, but it looks really interesting.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.760]   Is there-- so there is an API for it, wow.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.160]   Yeah, Hangouts, the Hangouts API.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.680]   So the Google Plus API came out right after we aired our show last week.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.680]   Right, yes.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.000]   It was the weekend working with.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.520]   I built a plugin for ThinkUp and super easy.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.600]   It's just OAuth, Jason.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   Really simple.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.960]   I mean, the Plus API is very limited right now.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.680]   It's just public posts and you can't get comments.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.400]   You can only comment counts and Plus ones.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:14.480]   But then the Hangouts API lets you create this sort of collaborative app where it maintains
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:19.160]   state and it plugs into the Hangouts window and you can-- so I haven't actually had a
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:23.640]   chance to play with any of the Hangouts apps, which are more like collaboration, whereas
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:29.840]   the Plus API is more like getting content out of Plus.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.120]   So there's people showing up.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.280]   I don't know what to do with them though.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   I'm happy to take it up.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.040]   You can't get a party of people coming.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:45.040]   Draw a sketch.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   Is that Shirley?
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   Hi, Shirley.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.960]   Nice to meet you.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.160]   Just should tell everybody who's joining us now that you're on a live streaming broadcast
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.000]   from the Twit network as we demonstrate these Hangouts.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Hi, Tom.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   I'm good.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.200]   Now I can plug my Google Plus account.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.240]   It's all about that.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.680]   Look, I could draw a picture.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.680]   Oh, there's a line.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:09.680]   There's a line.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.680]   That's cool.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.680]   This is neat.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   So this is for drawing.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.680]   You could share it.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.680]   I was playing the Hangouts with extras, Leo.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.680]   No, this is my first time.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   What do you-- tell me about it, Steven.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.680]   I hate the blackness underneath the--
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.680]   Yeah, I don't like the blackness.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   I agree.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.680]   Yeah, I think it's--
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.680]   But--
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   Because they're trying to do it for businesses.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   If you're trying to share a document, that's why it's long ways.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.680]   I love that.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.680]   Yeah, Google Docs integration.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.680]   They should have done that to stay one.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.680]   So I do like that.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.680]   And--
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.680]   Oh, snap.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.680]   Snap.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   Snap.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.680]   Well, it was a lot of fun while it lasted.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.680]   Sad folder.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   Sad folder.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.680]   Sad folder.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:51.680]   Sad folder.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   What else?
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   So we're API, and you think this is--
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   Now, the API is not very complete right now.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   This is a very simple part API, but you were able to build something for--
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680]   think up already.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   Yeah, I was-- you can authorize your account and then start pulling your posts.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   And so I just-- I think up now charts your post- recent-- your post-ones and replies over time.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   So yeah, it was really-- it was day and a half of just hacking with a couple of other developers in IRC.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   It was very easy to implement, but very limited.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.680]   So I'm assuming that it's going to get--
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.680]   What other features would you like to see?
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   Well, I want to get back comments.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:26.680]   I want to say-- I want to do things that make up like color the comments that are from people in my circles.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.680]   Color the comments that are from people in my inner circle.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.680]   Oh, I battle a lot.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680]   That kind of thing.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.680]   Just kind of conversation analysis type of thing.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.680]   You know, and think up we do word frequency analysis on a particular thread.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.680]   I would like to do that kind of thing with the Google+ stuff.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.680]   You know, ranking comments by a number of plus ones.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   You can have kind of a mini dig, that kind of thing.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   The power of this is going to just explode as people take the API and take it to the next level
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.680]   and create custom Google+ clients, both on the web and on mobile.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   And mobile too.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   Mobile is a really important part of this.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.680]   I mean, think about how third party clients made Twitter happen.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   Google+ is already to that point.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Now I had third party.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   It's mind boggling.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   Well, you know, I think about it with mobile.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   And I've done this before.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.680]   I thought the wave was going to change journalism forever.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   But--
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   So do we all, Jeff.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680]   So do we all.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   If you're at a news event, being able to show people online and then have that passed around to what you're seeing,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   that's very common.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.680]   We also should mention that Google+ went public a couple of days ago.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.680]   You no longer need an invitation.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   And boy, I think, you know, forget the ghost town comment.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   Just look at this graph of my Google+ circling.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   It just boom.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680]   But dang.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   3,000 new followers.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   Yes, you're also on the list, right?
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680]   I am on the list.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.680]   You're all three of you are on the list.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.680]   And I was recently removed for some reason.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   So I'm not on the list.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.680]   Yeah, you are now.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680]   I'm back.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   They've updated it?
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.680]   Yeah, both Gina and Jeff are now on the list.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680]   But not Mike Elgin.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.680]   There wasn't enough room for you and Jeff.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.680]   It is.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:11.680]   Look at Tom Anderson, who was hovering at 128,000 for the longest time, and people found out about him.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680]   Boom!
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.680]   But Gina, you're in news and Jeff isn't technology.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680]   He had 17,000, yes.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680]   That's perfect.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   That's gross.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   I think they're making this stuff up as they go along.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680]   That's funny.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.680]   Can you get Franken back on the line?
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.680]   Yes.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:34.080]   Reportedly, they're going to come out with an alternative to the suggested user list that's
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.200]   going to be related to search.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.360]   They're going to build a search tool where you can say, "Well, I'm interested in this
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.160]   stuff and it'll give you some people," instead of just this list that's awkwardly categorized
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.160]   and so on.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:50.520]   By the way, for those who say Google+ is a ghost town, just look at this.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.040]   I had a hangout which we closed because it crashed.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.560]   98 comments already.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560]   What is it?
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560]   Five minutes?
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   Yeah, look at them go by.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.560]   It's even fly-by.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.360]   So this is, I think, far from a...
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:10.120]   Speaking of ghost town, I asked Bradley, though, I sensed that the activity level, the
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.160]   scoble problem is far reduced.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.920]   I say, "I presume you've been tweaking with that."
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.920]   He said, "Yeah."
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.760]   There were two problems.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.160]   Either it was crickets or it was overload.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.880]   They were trying to find that kind of happy medium.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.440]   Now, on the other hand, I know we're not going to Facebook yet, but with Facebook subscribe,
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.480]   one post I put up on Facebook that was...
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.200]   You can only comment on things that are put on Facebook, not things imported from Twitter.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.400]   And suddenly, I got more comments on that one post than I've ever gotten on Facebook.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.240]   Yeah, huge amount of traffic on that.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.520]   Yeah, so I'm seeing both go up in their level of interactivity.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.120]   That by the way is what Kevin Rose also observed, but I pointed out that it also depends on
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120]   the audience.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.120]   I suspect there will be posts that will do better on Google+ than what you're saying.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.600]   I would do on Facebook and vice versa.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.880]   So I'm not sure that there's a good way to measure engagement.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.440]   Facebook has made...
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.360]   So have we got all the changes on Google+?
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.360]   I think we have.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.160]   Facebook has made some considerable changes.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.240]   And more coming tomorrow, I should point out we will be going live 9.30 tomorrow morning,
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.040]   Pacific 12.30 Eastern, to cover live, the streaming and F8 announcements.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.040]   Tom and I will be here.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.520]   In fact, if you guys want to join, please feel free if you're around.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.880]   I'd love to get your commentaries.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.080]   But I don't know what they're going to announce tomorrow because they've made some massive
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.000]   changes over the last couple of days.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.840]   The subscribe button was just the beginning.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.880]   They completely redesigned the news feed.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:34.560]   This is the new news feed where you get these little blue corners for top stories.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:40.880]   You get on the right a live scrolling update of what's going on.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.240]   You remember last week, I averted that maybe Facebook had gotten too busy, too complicated
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.000]   for the core audience that it's trying to serve.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   It looks more like Google+ than ever before.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.160]   It's Google+ on the left and Twitter on the right.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.160]   The difference is that...
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.440]   Well, but it's not Twitter on the right because this is in chronological.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.360]   And it's heavily filtered.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.840]   It's heavily filtered.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840]   So that's what's...
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.240]   You can still get all, right?
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.640]   I don't know if you can do that in one feature.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.360]   You can select each individual user and say, "I want everything from this person."
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.760]   Whether you can do that for all people.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   And they've totally deprecated.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.880]   You notice there's no status box.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.240]   You actually have to click a button to get the status box back or this new thing of asking
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.880]   a question.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.280]   Mashable did a survey and found that they asked, "Love it or hate it?"
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.080]   And 70-something hated it and 12 percent.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.080]   Isn't that always the case by every case?
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.080]   Exactly.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.080]   It's a Valentine.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.200]   And I think this is not the audience they should be talking about because the Mashable
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.320]   audience is people like us.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.200]   I wonder, to be honest, what the real...
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.520]   We talked about this last week.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.840]   I just think that Facebook is losing its way.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.080]   They are going my space on us.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   And I just...
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:04.040]   I fully believe that they are going to alienate their core audience who want simple.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.720]   Here's what I fear the problem is.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.520]   They succeeded in getting grandma and cousin Elmer and everybody.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:15.800]   And now that's their best feature and also their biggest problem because people just
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.800]   want to share photos and get the gossip and interact with their relatives and friends
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.680]   from high school and stuff like that.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   That's pretty much all Facebook people want.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.600]   When you try to start a conversation on Facebook about Facebook, nobody wants to talk about
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   it.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600]   They don't care about Facebook.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   On Google+, you'd want to talk...
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.400]   People love talking about Google+, because they're enthusiastic about the platform.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.360]   Facebook users are not enthusiastic about Facebook.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.360]   I think this is kind of...
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   They're real people.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   Yes.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   They have a lot.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360]   Like, look at us.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360]   We're talking about a telephone.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   It's a tool for them.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   Right.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.720]   And the problem is, if you got a hammer that every three weeks changed how it worked.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720]   It's like, what?
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.120]   I hate that.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.280]   Just give me a freaking hammer.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.280]   And I just...
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:00.200]   I have to think that this is going to only annoy their core audience.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.240]   The reason that it hasn't killed them is there's nowhere else to go.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.760]   And they're not going to go to Google+, because that's...
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.080]   People who like Google+, will like this.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.720]   Well, and I'm concerned about the media platform aspects that are coming tomorrow and in the
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.560]   near future where people are going to be listening and streaming music and TV shows.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.640]   They're going to add an addition to the like button.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.720]   They're going to have a reading and watching.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.200]   I mean, this is good.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.680]   I don't think people want...
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.080]   Some people want to share, but I don't think people want to be shared with.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.880]   I don't want my stream to be filled with what people are listening to.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   You know?
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.560]   But I don't think anybody wants that.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.880]   No, I agree with you, but I think Facebook, what they're both struggling with is giving
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.920]   you control on various levels, right?
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.400]   Control of what you publish and who sees it and control of what you see.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.080]   And trying to make that more immediate to the act.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:01.680]   I love it because right now Facebook is suggesting I subscribe to Eduardo Savarin and Sean Parker.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.440]   How did they know?
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.920]   No, wink-a-bye.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.880]   No wink-a-bye, but Chris Cox is president of product.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.880]   What's this saying?
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880]   What's the beginning to a fight on your own?
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880]   This is bizarre.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.320]   This is who they're saying I should subscribe to.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:20.800]   The two early founders of Facebook and two current executives at Facebook.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.800]   Bazaar.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.320]   Oh, but you're an edge case.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.360]   By the way, I am proud to say that Facebook does not consider me a journalist.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.800]   I did not make it onto the list of 50 journalists who are subscribers on Facebook.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.640]   I didn't either.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.560]   Yeah, but some interesting people did.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.400]   I'm so confused.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.240]   I couldn't find that list.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.680]   Yeah, well, it's not even Errington, I don't mind.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.280]   I think Errington's legit.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.000]   It was a very strange list and I'm hurt because maybe Facebook doesn't know I have some people
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   who actually follow me.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.960]   All right.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   What's going on?
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.280]   Anything else to say about Facebook?
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.280]   Well, tomorrow is not safe.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.440]   I think we expect media stuff, right?
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.280]   A study says, I don't know if this is your number.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.280]   I won't say it.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.600]   The Facebook's created quite a few jobs.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   Is that your number, Jeff?
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   Nope.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   Nope.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   Let's say.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:21.280]   Facebook has created, according to a study, 182,000 jobs by their platform, the app economy.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.240]   That's kind of what Eric Schmidt was saying.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.680]   The internet makes, creates jobs.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.120]   But this is what confuses people because, well, number one, it doesn't.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:38.320]   My argument that technology leads to efficiency over growth now says that Google at its height
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:43.480]   has a fraction of the employment that GM had and that will always be the case.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   That's the issue.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.240]   But it does create, when you're a platform, you do create entrepreneurial opportunities
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.280]   atop you and networks atop you.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.400]   And that's what's happening with Facebook and Google.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.920]   And it's a good thing.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   That's what we should be.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:00.360]   That's why we should be supporting their efforts to create jobs, which was part of Eric's point
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.160]   today, rather than saying, oh my God, they're too big.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160]   You start cutting them down.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   You also cut away jobs.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160]   And that's true.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.640]   And Google and Facebook are good from the job creation point of view.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.760]   But these numbers are completely meaningless.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   Number one, I don't think all these people would be unemployed without Facebook.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.560]   Number two, we don't know how many people have been put out of work because of Facebook.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.000]   I mean, it's just a number that's just out of context.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.160]   And we need more data before we can understand this.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.040]   Well, you're not going to get it.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.800]   I wonder how this number compares to Apple.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.320]   You know, Apple's Apple platform.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   Right.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   And also Google.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.720]   I think the internet, the computer, all of it, it's good.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   It's good.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.880]   Hey, here's some data.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.360]   This is a video from Four Square, which had one billion check-ins.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.240]   This is one week of check-ins on Four Square.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.240]   Talk about big data here.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.840]   I love these kinds of things.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.000]   And the bars, oh, I don't know what it is, but I love it.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.480]   The bars are arts and entertainment colleges and universities.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.160]   Food is yellow or green.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160]   Homework.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.760]   The Mississippi sure is a line, isn't it?
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.160]   Yeah, it's really going on there.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.160]   Wow, look at that.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.920]   It's just just just cuts right there.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.160]   You can't check into the muddy Mississippi.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   Nightlife.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160]   Wow.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.400]   It's just a little bit of a follow-up going crazy, crazy, man.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.440]   I think the coolest thing, the news about a Four Square, is that they now enable you
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.960]   to check in at home without revealing the address.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   Yes.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.120]   Yeah, you could turn that address off.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.640]   Oh, that's smart.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.680]   It's interesting because I think it's the first thing I didn't want you to check in
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   at home.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:42.000]   You know, it was like, yeah, this should be a business, but now they realize everybody
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.200]   checks in at home.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:50.440]   And in fact, it's kind of muddling their results because now when I go, I see, in addition
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.640]   to five businesses, 30 homes and there's going to be a problem down the road.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.840]   You know, these are some funny things.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.240]   What happens when the milkman becomes the mayor of your home?
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.640]   Hey, I'm not the mayor of my own home, actually.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.080]   Somebody at O'Reilly Media started checking in at my house.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.280]   I don't know why.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.320]   And the other thing that happens is the balkanization of businesses.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.080]   We have like four or five check-ins inside Twit right here already.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.840]   I'm the mayor of master control.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   Thank you.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.840]   I'm the mayor of master control.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.520]   The Dean Rivera, our producer is in fact the mayor of master control, as she ought to be.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.920]   It's time now for our tip, our number and our tool of the week.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.240]   Mike Eleganshime in, if you have anything to say in that, but I just hope I'm not the
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.240]   tool of the week.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.900]   You are not the, hey, that's a good idea.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.800]   Maybe we should rename the tool of the week.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.200]   All right.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.740]   I'll get, I'll have a tool of the week in a moment, but first, Gina's tip.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:47.100]   Well, you know, we kind of covered all of the best tips or to go to Google+ sign up.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.100]   It's open now.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:53.620]   I'm going to go to my search and try Hangouts and that those collaborative apps inside Hangouts.
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:58.540]   But while do another tips and to be covered that already, YouTube has a new video editor
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.380]   built in and I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but it's got quite a few options.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.220]   If you're logged in and you're looking at your videos, you click and edit video link.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.420]   You can rotate your video.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:13.580]   You can remove shaky camera motions, just contrast and saturation and color temperature.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:18.020]   You can add effects right, you know, right in on YouTube.com.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:22.980]   There's a video demo, which I linked in the show notes there.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.100]   So apparently there's another video editor that they already had that let you mix Creative
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.140]   Commons videos from other users into your video.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:37.300]   So this is a new video editor that lets you put in effects and calm down the Blair Witch
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.300]   effect.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.180]   So check that out and you're logging to YouTube and go to just your videos.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.180]   All right.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.180]   Look at that.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.180]   Very cool.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.180]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.180]   Stabilize.
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.180]   Stabilize is really nice.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.220]   The funny thing is the people getting their cameras and their phones, they need to squeeze
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.220]   the wrong way.
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.220]   I'm being able to fix that.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.460]   Rotating that by itself is huge.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:02.140]   My students used to do that in the early days here at the journalism school and we had
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.980]   to find all these apps to find and turn their precious video around.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:05.980]   Right.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:06.980]   That should everything in portrait.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:07.980]   Hey, this is cool.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.620]   You even have a Lomo button.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.420]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   Wow.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.420]   Wow, that is neat.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.180]   Our number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.220]   Well, considering all the Google talk, I thought I'd go with this one.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.300]   The comm score came out with its top website.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:25.300]   And of course, this is a bit of a red herring because Google makes its money all over the
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.180]   whole web and it's not really a website.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.780]   But in terms of the fears about their size, just looking only at that number of unique
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.420]   users, Google is number one at one hundred eighty three.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:41.100]   Yahoo is still amazingly to be number two at one seventy seven.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.100]   And I don't know.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.900]   I've been Yahoo in 10 years.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:44.900]   Microsoft one seventy seven.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:50.100]   I still have been a Microsoft sites Facebook one sixty two AOL one oh nine Amazon one oh
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.500]   one million people and my two.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   That's amazing.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.500]   Look at that.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.500]   And I like how it's like on tractor feed.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.420]   That's good.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.020]   I think this is the modern day.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:09.140]   You don't actually have to use dashes for lines separating your items on your.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.660]   What the hell is that?
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.140]   It's like they typed it.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.140]   That's funny.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.140]   matrix printer.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.140]   It's very retro.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.060]   Well, there's going to be a new you know, there's the eight bit trend down there.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.900]   We're going to have the dot matrix trend.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.900]   I'll pronounce it.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900]   I'm going to look like that.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.900]   I'm inspired by Mike Elegant.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.180]   I'm going to make my tool of the week not in fact a software tool, but I'm going to
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:31.620]   nade the Hewlett Packard board is our tools of the week this year.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:36.020]   Not only have they taken a great company and run it to the ground today news comes out
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:43.340]   that the board is considering replacing their CEO Leo Apotheca with Meg Whitman.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:49.700]   So I'll tell you if you thought it couldn't get any worse at Hewlett Packard.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.700]   You hit my.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.900]   Oh, there's such a book in that.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:01.500]   On top of everything else yesterday, I was screaming at my fax machine, making me a
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.900]   line print things when I'm not printing.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   I'm just faxing.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.900]   I need this.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.820]   I hate I want fax machines to die.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:12.740]   I want printer drivers to die.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.740]   You're here here.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.900]   I'm concerned about is that I mean, I mean, whether Meg Whitman ends up being the governor
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:23.660]   of HP or not is one question, but they're obviously getting rid of the current guy and
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:31.420]   he's the one probably who's so anti web OS and anti engineer all the changes last week.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.380]   So just buying the company in Britain because it's the same business he is in.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   He used to do.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.380]   I mean, it's if you get rid of him, it's like you said, let's go this way.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.180]   No, let's go that way.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:46.020]   But when they get rid of him and the new people come in, I think there's a really good chance
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.020]   they're going to say, you know what?
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.940]   This whole web O web OS thing is pretty great.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.100]   We should bring it back.
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.500]   Maybe it's our best bet.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:57.300]   Okay, quiz, which company has the worst board Yahoo or Hewlett Packard man?
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:00.580]   Maybe they should just swap boards.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:07.140]   You would notice a doofus in for doofus number one, doofus number two, Meg Whitman, of course,
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:12.220]   the former eBay CEO who so folks so famously bought Skype without getting the key technology
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.660]   that made Skype possible.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.380]   And now we are done.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.460]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:24.300]   Mike Elgin, if people are not following him on Google+, they really ought to be because
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:28.460]   his newsletter, which is a great read and certainly worth subscribing is actually built.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.860]   It's made out of Google+.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.420]   That's right.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:36.260]   So I can now search Mike Elgin in the Google+ search button and I'll find him.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.500]   He's already in my tech journalist circle, by the way.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.300]   And read all this stuff he got to.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.300]   So this is really it.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.900]   This is where you live.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.940]   It's all on Google+ now.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:49.420]   And it's pretty nice to have one stream to worry about.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.060]   Yeah, it's just you're an inspiration.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.180]   And I just, yeah, we'll have Mike back because he's just fantastic.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:59.820]   Jeff Jarvis, the new book, Public Parts, comes out on Tuesday.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:00.820]   Yay.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.820]   Ooh.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:09.420]   Buzzmachine.com's the blog at Jeff Jarvis, the Twitter plus Jeff Jarvis, the Google+
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.820]   hiding behind my public persona.
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.140]   Behind toilet man.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.860]   So is that what the publisher calls?
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.740]   That's what my wife calls it.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.700]   It's like Google like take them.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:25.020]   Jeff, why'd you put toilet man on the cover of your book?
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:32.260]   And of course, Gina Trapani, who is at smartawear.org and a creator of the ThinkUp app at ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:37.340]   Is there any way that, I mean, I'm on ThinkUp, but is there any way that people can get
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.700]   it somehow besides running their own server?
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:45.140]   Yeah, we actually have an Amazon AMI launcher where you, I mean, it's still kind of geeky,
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:50.580]   but you copy your Amazon EC2 key into a web form and you hit one button and it spins up
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:52.340]   the server and installs it.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.380]   And it totally, it works great.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.500]   It doesn't auto update yet.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.740]   So we're still in beta.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.620]   So things are still a little, once we have the one or release, you'll be able to hit one
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:04.980]   button launch on Amazon EC2, have a full instance running with auto updates and yeah.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:09.180]   And how much would that cost for somebody who just wanted to do that to have an EC2 instance
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:10.180]   running?
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:15.420]   I think EC2 has a deal with a micro instances now where it's free for a few months, a couple
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.380]   of few months, but then it's like, I don't know, 15 bucks a month or something.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.100]   It would be, it's the equivalent of a cheap web hosting plan.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.100]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:27.900]   So in the Barack Obama, Steve Martin and Leo Laport, have your own think up account today.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.900]   Yes.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.460]   I'm actually running on Gina's server.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.620]   I tried to set up a server.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:33.900]   It was too hard for me.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.980]   No, it was, you were missing a module.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:42.100]   Yeah, silly PHP module and my art, my sister's admins quite wisely will no longer let me
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.900]   do anything like install PHP modules on the server.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:49.100]   So I just had to say, thank you, Gina.
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.100]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:51.100]   Thank you.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.980]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:58.580]   We do this show every Wednesday at about 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern, 1300 UTC at
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:02.980]   law, no, actually 2000 UTC at live.tuit.tv.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.780]   We're going to keep live.tuit.tv around because it's the only way you can watch us on a PS3.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:10.980]   But of course now you can also go to the new website, twit.tv and see the live stream,

[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.860]   You know, I had these phones.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:24.860]   I'm really kind of bummed.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.860]   I had all these phones.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.260]   I was going to show you the new, we've got the Droid Bionic here.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:33.300]   We've got the new LG revolution here and a whole bunch more on new Android phones.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.300]   Hey, there's good news.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.300]   I didn't get it into this show.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.780]   I ran out of time.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:41.700]   But Jason Howell and Eileen Rivera, our esteemed producer, do a show called All About Android.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.100]   Every Monday morning, it's 11 a.m.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.380]   No, it's afternoon evening.
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.060]   Every Monday evening at 5.00 p.m.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.740]   Yeah, thereabouts on twit.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:56.300]   So please watch All About Android or better yet subscribe to it at twit.tv and you'll
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:21:00.340]   hear about all those phones this coming Monday because they're going to review them this
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.340]   weekend.
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.940]   That's it for this week in Google.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.940]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.940]   We'll see you next time.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:04.940]   Bye bye.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:22.060]   You bet we're going to do review on Monday.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.580]   We're going to make it my fault through the weekend.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:26.580]   Good.
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.580]   See how it goes.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.460]   Is this the shark that I saw floating above Tom's head and English bus?
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.460]   Yes.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.020]   In shark week on twit.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.020]   Sweet.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:41.020]   Instead of jumping the shark, the shark's jumping us.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:44.020]   All right.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:49.700]   I have learned how to steer it.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.700]   Thanks guys.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.700]   Thank you.
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.700]   Thank you so much.
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.700]   Thanks, Mike.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.700]   That's all right.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.700]   You know what?
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:56.700]   Nobody even noticed.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.700]   I noticed, but nobody else noticed.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.700]   She froze again.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.700]   Oh, look.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   I'm frozen again.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:01.700]   I know.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.700]   I was calling her back several times actually.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:03.700]   That's usually murder.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   Here's your theme.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.340]   Finally, you can't get away from me.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.340]   You should be some.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.180]   You've just been sexually harassed, Gita.
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.180]   All out, Frank.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.180]   Thank you.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.180]   Thanks, Mike.
